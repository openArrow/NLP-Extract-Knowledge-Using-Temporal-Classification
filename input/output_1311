Sri Lanka's selectors have left out Test captain  Arjuna Ranatunga from a 31-man squad to start training for Pakistan's visit in  July.
However, Ranatunga, who faces disciplinary action over his refusal to tour  Sharjah last month, could be brought into the pool later if he is cleared of  misconduct charges at a board inquiry on May 30.
The Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka executive on Sunday called  on the selectors to drop Ranatunga from the national pool until the inquiry.
The BCCSL decided to take a tough stand after Ranatunga refused to  apologise for pulling out of the Australasia Cup. Ranatunga was angered by the  exclusion of his deputy Aravinda de Silva from the side because he failed a  physical fitness test.
The board decided not to punish three others who also withdrew from the  Sharjah squad for the same reason because they had tendered a "qualified  apology."
Opening batsman Roshan Mahanama captained Sri Lanka at the Australasia Cup  following Ranatunga's withdrawal.
