Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Sunday that  the gap between Israel and Syria in the search for a peace settlement was  still "wide and deep."
"The time has arrived for the Syrians to talk directly to us, out of the  limelight of the media, in a way really to get to the essence of the problems.  There is no sign so far they want to go that way," he said.
"So far the gap between the Syrian position and approach to us is wide and  deep," Rabin said in an interview with BBC World Service radio.
"If the Syrians believe the United States will deliver Israel, they don't  understand the reality of relations between us and Washington," he said,  referring to the US role as chief sponsor of the Middle East peace process.
He added that US Secretary of State Warren Christopher was expected back  in the region around June 12 for another peace mission.
The two countries have failed to make progress, with Syria insisting first  on a total Israeli withdrawal from the annexed Golan Heights and Israel  demanding an initial Syrian pledge for full peace.
