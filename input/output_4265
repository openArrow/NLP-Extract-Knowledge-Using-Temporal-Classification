Two Welsh football fans, who fired a rocket  flare that killed a pensioner at the end of a World Cup match, were jailed for  three years on Thursday.
Retired postman John Hill, 67, died instantly when the missile hit his  chest as the final whistle sounded on Wales' World Cup campaign at Cardiff  Arms Park in November 1993.
Andrew McAllister, 31, and his half-brother Kerry Still, 35, both of  Wrexham, had admitted manslaughter at Cardiff Crown Court.
The court was told that Still handed the rocket to McAllister believing it  to be a hand-held flare.
McAllister had pointed it horizontally across the ground towards the north  stand, packed with 10,000 of the 40,000 crowd.
The 12 inch-long marine distress rocket, designed to reach an altitude of  1,000ft in six seconds, streaked across the ground into the north stand and  was still accelerating when it hit Mr Hill, sitting 422ft away.
Witnesses said the rocket roared "like a jet engine" as it shot across the  stadium.
The victim died in the arms of his 35-year-old son, also called John, who  had taken him to the World Cup qualifier, which Romania won 2-1 to deny Wales  a place in the finals.
The brothers, who had both been drinking before the match, had originally  pleaded not guilty to murder. This charge was later dropped.
