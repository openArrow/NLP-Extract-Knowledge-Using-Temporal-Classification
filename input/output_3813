Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and Hitachi  Zosen Corp. announced Wednesday declines in consolidated earnings for the year  to March but said parent company profits would improve this year.
Mitsubishi Heavy, the country's biggest shipbuilder, defence contractor  and nuclear power plant concern, said its pre-tax earnings dived 16 percent  from a year earlier to 128 billion yen (1.2 billion dollars).
Sales slipped 1.4 percent to 2,784 billion yen, depressed by lower revenue  from most activities except power systems, which were flat.
Mitsubishi Heavy offered no group forecast for this year but said parent  company earnings, which tumbled 15.3 percent to 119 billion yen, were expected  to stage a partial recovery to 130 billion yen. Parent sales, which dropped  2.3 percent to 2,435 billion yen, are expected to rise to 2,500 billion yen.
Hitachi Zosen, the heavy engineering affiliate of Sanwa Bank Ltd., said  its consolidated pre-tax profit fell 0.8 percent to 24.6 billion yen despite a  17.1 percent increase in group sales to 525 billion yen.
Group forecasts for the current year were also not available but parent  company earnings, which grew 26 percent to 22 billion yen in the latest year,  were forecast to rise to 23 billion yen. Parent sales, which were up 12.4  percent at 403 billion yen, were projected to climb to 420 billion yen.
"Although some people are saying the economy is recovering, we forecast  that the prolonged sluggishness will continue for some time due to structural  problems in the Japanese economy," Hitachi Zosen said in a statement.
For the year just ended, Mitsubishi Heavy said revenue from its  shipbuilding and steel structure operations edged down 0.1 percent to 448  billion yen while power systems revenue was flat at 683 billion yen.
Machinery sales dived 8.2 percent to 517 billion yen and revenue from  aircraft and special vehicles such as tanks fell 0.2 percent to 456 billion  yen. Sales of general machinery and components along with airconditioning and  refrigeration systems dropped 3.2 percent to 331 billion yen.
Hitachi's revenue from shipbuilding and the construction of steel  structures fell 0.4 percent to 167 billion yen. But sales of machinery and  prime movers grew 5.7 percent to 56 billion yen and revenue from industrial  plant and environmental equipment jumped 22.7 percent to 155 billion yen.
Other sales, including revenue from biochemicals, new materials and  electronic control equipment, jumped 19 percent to 25 billion yen.
