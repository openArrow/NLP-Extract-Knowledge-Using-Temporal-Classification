A two-day conference of 57 countries opened here   Thursday with the aim of defusing possible new wars in Europe by settling  potential border disputes and solving the problems of minorities.
The conference, opened by UNESCO director-general Federico Mayor at the  organisation's headquarters here, is the brainchild of French Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur.
It will aim to frame a Stability Pact which would be signed by the end of  the year for potential new candidates to the European Union (EU).
Russia is respresented at the conference by Foreign Minister Andrei  Kozyrev and the United States by Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs  Peter Tarnoff.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has said the summit aims to settle  border and minority problems between "countries with the vocation of entering  the EU," following the collapse of the Soviet bloc.
