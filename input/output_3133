South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-Joo said  Monday that North Korea should understand that cooperation in defusing the row  over its suspected nuclear-arms program would guarantee international help in  rebuilding its economy.
"It is important that North Korea understands ... that the international  community would like to see this issue resolved through dialogue," Han told  journalists here after meeting Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas.
"And by these, we mean that the rest of the world is prepared to work with  North Korea in its efforts to revive or resurrect its economy ... North Korea  can be assured of cooperation if North Korea itself cooperates on this issue,"  he said.
He said the Korean peninsula was facing a "very critical period" and hoped  further talks between North Korea and the United States might lead to finally  resolving the nuclear issue.
"If a third round takes place, attempts will be made to resolve the North  Korean nuclear issue in a more fundamental way," Han said.
However, he declined to say whether any such meeting would take place. The  two countries have already met twice on the issue, in New York and Geneva.
He said that in such talks, Seoul hoped to see the nuclear suspicion  removed from the peninsula, and for Pyongyang to comply with the safeguard  regulations of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
"We hope the meeting (if any) will open the way for North Korea to become  a responsible member of the NPT (Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty)," Han added.
Han arrived here late Sunday for a two-day visit to strengthen bilateral  ties. He is scheduled to meet with Indonesian President Suharto Tuesday and  leave the country early Wednesday.
