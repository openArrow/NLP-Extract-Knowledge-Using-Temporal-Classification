Five North Koreans who escaped from controversial  Pyongyang-run logging camps in Siberia arrived here Wednesday to seek asylum  in South Korea.
A foreign ministry spokesman said the five would receive vocational  training and unspecified sums for resettlement.
South Korea's embassy in Moscow said 90 other escaped North Korean loggers  wanted to settle in South Korea but that the overall number of North Koreans  who had fled the logging camps was not known.
North Korea is reported to have called on Russia to arrest and extradite  the escaped loggers, calling them criminals. Pyongyang says it will consider  their presence in South Korea as "kidnapping."
South Korean press reports said an estimated 5,000 North Korean workers  were forced into slave labor in logging camps in Siberia.
