New fears of inflation pushed interest rates  higher and depressed blue-chip stock prices Monday after seven consecutive  rising sessions for the Dow Jones industrial average.
With profit-taking also weighing down the market, the Dow index of 30  leading industrials lost 23.94 points to close at 3,742.41.
On the broader market, losing shares outnumbers advancers 1,219 to 904  with 686 unchanged. Some 249 million shares changed hands.
The dip in stocks came as jittery investors put money into commodities,  which pushed those prices higher and spread concern that prices of raw  materials could spark higher overall inflation and interest rates, analysts  said.
"The higher commodity prices are saying we have an inflation scare here,"  said Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer.
On the bond market, the yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury issue  jumped to 7.43 percent from 7.30 percent at Friday's close.
Food stocks rose following the friendly takeover offer from Switzerland's  Sandoz for Gerber, which jumped 15-5/8 to 50-1/4. The Sandoz offer was 53  percent higher than Friday's closing price for the baby food giant. CPC  International rose 1-7/8 to 48 and Campbell Soup 7/8 to 37-5/8.
Oil company stocks declined as crude prices fell. Chevron was off 1-7/8 to  86-7/8, Atlantic Richfield 2-5/8 to 100-1/2 and Amoco 1-1/8 to 57-1/8.
