Yemen's ambassador to Djibouti was unable to  enter his office here Saturday after he was threatened by three armed men,  Abdou Kassim Nagui told AFP.
Nagui who is from south Yemen said the three men were from the Yemeni  capital of Saana, in the north. Their group was headed by the embassy's former  security official.
The attack was "contrary to international conventions and protocol," he  added.
All other embassy staff was able to enter the embassy offices.
North and South Yemen have been locked in a grim struggle after civil war  erupted on May 5 and south Yemen leaders declared independence a week ago,  four years after the tribal north and the formerly Marxist south merged.
