President Bakili Muluzi of Malawi Sunday  dissolved the boards of all the country's state-run organizations in a  crackdown on corruption in the regime of his predecessor, long-time ruler  Hastings Kamuzu Banda.
Muluzi's office said in a statement that new boards would be appointed  soon.
The organizations, ranging from the University of Malawi to the national  airline, were manned by appointees of Banda. Former minister of state John  Tembo chaired most of them or was a board member in the major ones.
The most controversial has been the central bank, whose governor Francis  Perekamoyo is closely associated with the Banda regime.
The new government wants the bank to be independent of political influence  and its appointments to be based on merit.
Muluzi won Malawi's first democratic elections, held on Thursday, ending  three decades of rule by Banda.
"This country is poor and we will not condone corruption," Muluzi said  Saturday in his inaugural speech.
