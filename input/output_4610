Kazakhstan on Friday became the 19th country to  join the Partnership for Peace program with NATO, with Foreign Minister Kanat  Saudabayev saying it would help contribute to world peace and stability.
"This document responds to the interests of our country which strives for  stability," the minister said after signing the document. "We do not accept  any kind of confrontation or conflict."
The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation program launched last January  provides for increased military cooperation between the Atlantic Alliance and  former Soviet bloc states.
In response to reporters' questions, Saudabayev said his country, one of  four former Soviet states to hold nuclear arms, along with Russia, Ukraine and  Belarus, would continue sending nuclear arms to Russia for dismantling "after  some technical questions are solved."
Kazakhstan up to March had transferred to Russia 12 of a total 104 SS-18  nuclear missiles for dismantling under terms of the START I Strategic Arms  Reduction Treaty.
At the signing ceremony, NATO Deputy Secretary General Sergio Balanzino  hailed Kazakhstan as a signatory of both the START and the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty, saying it was a "sign of your commitment to the  reduction and elimination of nuclear weapons on your territory."
