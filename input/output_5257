Roger Penske's race team took its 10th victory here, the sweetest because  it came with new Mercedes engine. No first-year motor had won here in 70  years. The only prior Mercedes win here came in 1915, when Ralph DePalma  averaged 89.84 mph (143.744 kh/h) and had a mechanic riding with him.
Villeneuve was the race's youngest driver at 23 and the fastest rookie  qualifier ever here. He is the son of the late Formula One star Giles  Villeneuve.
"If he were here, I think he would be proud. I would be happy to see his  face," Villeneuve said. "It feels great finishing second here because this is  the world's most important race."
England's Nigel Mansell finished 22nd after being struck from behind by  first-time Indy starter Dennis Vitolo during a caution period. Mansell, who  was in third place at the time, suffered a concussion and a minor burn.  Vitolo, who had not started an Indy-car race since 1992, was unhurt.
"I can't understand why the greatest spectacle in racing lets guys race  here who don't race anywhere else on the circuit," Mansell said.
Vitolo accepted blame for the mishap.
"It was my fault," he said. "I hit John Andretti and that launched my car  on top of Nigel. I don't have a good excuse. To come here and take myself and  someone else out is such a silly thing. It doesn't feel good."
Mansell's teammate, Mario Andretti, drove only 23 laps before an engine  problem ended his 29th and final Indy 500 bid. The retiring Italian-born racer  finished in 32nd place.
"It's a big letdown for something as stupid as this," Andretti said. "It's  disappointing. We were competitive. Everything was paying off. Now it's over.  There will be no tears. I said it before and I will stick to it."
