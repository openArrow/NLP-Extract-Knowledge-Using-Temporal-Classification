Chinese film maker Yin Li, who has been prevented  from attending the Cannes festival, said Monday he expected to go France in  the next few days after a short delay.
"I regret not having been able to leave for France (on Sunday) but still  expect to go to Paris in a few days then head to other European countries to  promote my film," he said here.
Yin, 36, who picked up a visa from the French embassy here on Saturday,  was to have left for France on Sunday, according to French sources.
They said the director was unlikely to go to Cannes, in line with a  decision by the Chinese authorities.
Yin was told not to take part in the prestigious festival in protest at  the screening of a film by another Chinese director, Zhang Yimou, "To Live,"  which has not received Beijing's approval.
"To Live," by the director of the 1991 hit "Raise the Red Lantern," tells  the story of three generations of a family living through the China of the  1940s, 50s and 60s, including the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural  Revolution, events that claimed countless lives.
The film, considered a contender for the festival's highest prize, the  Golden Palm, has not been approved by Chinese censors. It was, however, shown  in Cannes last Tuesday despite Zhang's absence.
Yin's film "The History of Xinghua" was shown in Cannes Friday.
