US Secretary of State Warren Christopher is to make  an unscheduled stopover in Egypt for talks with President Hosni Mubarak, a US  diplomatic source here said Tuesday.
Christopher, who was Tuesday in Israel and also visited the Palestinian  self-rule enclave of Jericho, is expected in Cairo on Wednesday on Thursday,  the source said.
The secretary is on a peace shuttle between Syria and Israel to try and  bring them back to the negotiating table. He met Egypt's Foreign Minister Amr  Mussa last Saturday in Geneva.
