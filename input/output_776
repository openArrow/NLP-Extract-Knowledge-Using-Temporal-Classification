The Swiss Red Cross (CRS) will pay a monthly pension  of more than 1,000 dollars a month for life to around 30 people who became  infected with the AIDS virus after receiving blood transfusions from its  stocks, the Zurich Sonnagszeitung weekly reported.
CRS president Karl Kennel confirmed the paper's story to the Bern-based  ATS news agency.
A recent large-scale inquiry by the Swiss interior ministry into 315  suspect blood products delivered to 70 hospitals between 1982 and 1992 without  undergoing systematic screening found 52 people had been infected with  Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Of the 52, 18 had died by the end of last  year.
The pension of approximately 1,500 Swiss francs (1,050 dollars) would meet  the sum demanded by the Swiss haemophiliac society. The exact sum will be  decided in June by the central committee of the CRS.
Back in 1990, the Swiss authorities came out in favour of paying the  victims a 50,000 francs lump sum compensation.
Jacques Barillon, president of the Swiss association for the defence of  haemophiliacs, described the mooted 1,500 francs a month compensation as  merely "a drop of water in an ocean of blood."
He said the announcement had come far too late and noted the CRS had  waited for the recent arrest of one of its top officials over the scandal  before itself reacting to the case.
A former director of the CRS' central laboratory, Alfred Haessig, was  charged earlier this month by a Geneva court with knowingly causing serious  bodily harm.
The court set up an investigation into the affair two years ago after  taking up the cases of several people infected with the contaminated products.
Haessig, now retired, has denied any wrongdoing, but will have to explain  to the court why the contaminated blood products were put on the market  unchecked between 1985 and 1986 when testing for contamination was already  available.
