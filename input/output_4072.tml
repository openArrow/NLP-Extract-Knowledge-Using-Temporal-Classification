Some 17 million voters are <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">registered</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e5" class="ASPECTUAL" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">choose</EVENT> a successor to Liberal  President Cesar Gaviria.&#13;
The Liberals' hopeful, <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION">43-year-old</TIMEX3> Ernesto Samper, has been <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE_PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">polling</EVENT> just  slightly ahead of his top competitor, <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION">39-year-old</TIMEX3> Conservative Andres  Pastrana. But a survey <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE">this week</TIMEX3> for the first time <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">gave</EVENT> Pastrana the edge.&#13;
And due to electoral rule <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">changes</EVENT>, if no candidate <EVENT eid="e9" class="STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">nets</EVENT> an absolute  majority of the vote <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX3>, the race will <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="FUTURE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">move</EVENT> into a runoff that would be  <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="would">held</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE">June 19</TIMEX3>.&#13;
Also for the first time, voters here will <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="FUTURE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">elect</EVENT> a vice-president, <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">running</EVENT>  on the ticket with their presidential candidate.&#13;
Previously, Congress could <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="could">elect</EVENT> a president for a <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION">two-year</TIMEX3> term in the  event the presidency <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">became</EVENT> vacant. But the elected vice-president <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE">now</TIMEX3> will be  first in line in the power succession in the event of such a <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">crisis</EVENT>.&#13;
Samper, Gaviria's former development minister, and Pastrana, the son of a  former president, each have been <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE_PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">polling</EVENT> at about 45 percent.&#13;
Their Liberal and Conservative Parties have <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">dominated</EVENT> this geographically  diverse country of tropical lowlands, Andean highlands and valleys, and  Caribbean and Pacific coasts since <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE">the 19th century</TIMEX3>.&#13;
Gaviria, 47, whose <TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DURATION">four-year term</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e19" class="ASPECTUAL" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">ends</EVENT> in <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE">August</TIMEX3>, has an unusually high  popularity rating of about 60 percent.&#13;
And unlike other elections in which bringing about <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">change</EVENT> has been voters'  top interest, Gaviria's would-be successors have been <EVENT eid="e21" class="I_ACTION" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE_PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">pledging</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">follow</EVENT> in  his policy footsteps.&#13;
His popularity <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">stems</EVENT> largely from the belief that <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">negotiations</EVENT> between his  government and leftist rebels sharply <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">reduced</EVENT> the number of bloody  car-bombings in the capital, and from a two-pronged anti-drugs strategy that  <EVENT eid="e26" class="I_ACTION" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">calls</EVENT> for leniency for criminals who surrender and tough <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">pursuit</EVENT> of those who  do not.&#13;
The drugs policy is widely <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">credited</EVENT> with <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">breaking</EVENT> the once-powerful  Medellin cocaine cartel. The Cali cartel has <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">replaced</EVENT> as the country's leading  narcotics processor and exporter.&#13;
Polls <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">put</EVENT> former M-19 guerrilla leader and Gaviria's former health  minister, Antonio Navarro, in third place with about 5 percent of the vote.&#13;
If there is a stunning surprise, it will <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="FUTURE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">come</EVENT> from retired general Miguel  Maza, the former head of the secret police and the sworn enemy of Pablo  Escobar, the head of the Medellin cocaine cartel <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">shot</EVENT> dead by police six  months ago.&#13;
He has been <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE_PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">polling</EVENT>, however, at just short of three percent with the  remaining few percentage points <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">divided</EVENT> among fully 15 other candidates.&#13;
Escobar's dramatic surrender in <TIMEX3 tid="t13" type="DATE">June 1991</TIMEX3> and the subsequent dismantling  of the Medellin cartel was the high-water mark of Gaviria's administration and  a vindication of his decision not to <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="NEG" modality="none">extradite</EVENT> drug kingpins to the United  States if they <EVENT eid="e37" class="I_ACTION" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">agree</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">surrender</EVENT>.&#13;
The policy <EVENT eid="e39" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">worked</EVENT>, and drug-related violence <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">dropped</EVENT> despite Escobar's  escape in <TIMEX3 tid="t14" type="DATE">July 1992</TIMEX3>. Colombian police <EVENT eid="e41" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">pursued</EVENT> him for <TIMEX3 tid="t15" type="DURATION">18 months</TIMEX3> before he was  <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">killed</EVENT>. Gaviria had less success <EVENT eid="e43" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">battling</EVENT> the Cali cartel.&#13;
Another defeat for Gaviria has been his relative lack of success in <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">making</EVENT>  peace with the country's two largest rebel movements: the ultranationalist  National Liberation Army (ELN), which wants foreign interests out of  Colombia's oil industry and often targets pipelines and drilling sites, and  the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).&#13;
Gaviria <EVENT eid="e45" class="ASPECTUAL" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">began</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e46" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">talks</EVENT> almost as soon as he <EVENT eid="e47" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">took</EVENT> power in <TIMEX3 tid="t16" type="DATE">1990</TIMEX3> with periodic  meetings around Colombia and in Venezuela and Mexico.&#13;
But to no avail, as about 10,000 guerrillas are <EVENT eid="e48" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">believed</EVENT> to be active in  Colombia. The president himself has <EVENT eid="e49" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">estimated</EVENT> that 512 of Colombia's 1,038  cities have some rebel presence.&#13;
In addition to drug and rebel violence, right-wing groups and common crime  <EVENT eid="e50" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">bring</EVENT> Colombia's murder rate to 25,000 in <TIMEX3 tid="t17" type="DATE">1993</TIMEX3> in a country of 33.5 million.&#13;
Colombia's economic <EVENT eid="e51" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">growth</EVENT> has been solid by Latin American standards with  Gaviria's policies of reducing protectionism, though his administration has  been <EVENT eid="e52" class="I_ACTION" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">accused</EVENT> of <EVENT eid="e53" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="PERFECTIVE_PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">neglecting</EVENT> social ills, especially health care woes and  education.&#13;
