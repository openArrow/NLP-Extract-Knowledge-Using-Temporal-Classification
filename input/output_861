Iran could break ties with Britain if London failed  to provide a convincing explanation over the alleged bugging of the Iranian  embassy, MP Majid Naderi said Monday.
Tehran said last Wednesday that a listening device had been found late  April inside a wall at the Iranian embassy in London. Britain has refused to  comment on the affair.
Naderi, a member of parliament's foreign affairs subcommittee, told Abrar  newspaper there was a possibility "of any kind of conflict" with London, but  that the National Security Council would have to give its opinion first.
"If the British government does not come up with a convincing explanation  over the spying, a break in relations is possible," he said.
Tehran has strongly protested against the bugging and said it would  "weaken relations with Britain."
Several newspapers here have urged the government to reconsider economic  ties with Britain, which is Iran's fourth biggest trade partner.
