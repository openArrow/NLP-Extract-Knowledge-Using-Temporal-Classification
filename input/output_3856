"Obviously I'm very, very happy with my game," said a smiling Pierce after  her win, adding: "I owe a lot to my new trainer Nick Bollettieri.
"We have worked hard and now I feel really fit and that gives me a lot of  confidence."
Pierce, looking much more relaxed and happier in recent months, is no  longer under the influence of controversial father Jim Pierce -- who was  bannned from atending all women's tournaments after being expelled from Roland  Garros twelve months ago for rowdy behaviour.
"I haven't seen my father since December," admitted Pierce, "But we have  spoken occasionally on the phone.
Pierce said it was, "very special having the public behind you."
"But it makes you a little nervous at first because you want so badly to  please them you tend to overdo it."
Asked if she was confident of reaching a probable semi-final against Graf,  Pierce replied: "You never know what can happen in tennis. I'm just pleased to  have played two good matches in a row. Now I must try to stay concentrated."
"Obviously I would like to play Graf in the semi-final. It would be very  exciting and I'm playing well at the moment."
"Against her you can make no mistakes. You have to stay alert and be  mentally tough every point, every game."
Fabrice Santoro, a wild-card entry, gave France a second victory of the  day when he defeated 42nd-ranked American Jonathan Stark 6-2, 6-2, 6-2.
He now plays either compatriot Olivier Delaitre or Agustin Garizzio of  Argentina for a place in the last sixteen.
