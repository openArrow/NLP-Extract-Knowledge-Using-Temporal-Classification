Chinese film-maker Yin Li, who had been prevented  by Chinese authorities from attending the Cannes film festival, was finally  authorized to leave for France, sources said here Sunday.
Yin Li, 36, picked up his visa Saturday from the French embassy in Beijing  and said he was planning to arrive in Paris Sunday, "but not in Cannes,"  French sources said.
Yin Li could not be reached for comment Sunday, and he was not at his  apartment. The film-maker was allowed to go to Paris but not attend the  festival, sources said.
On Friday, Yi Lin said officials here asked him not to go to Cannes as a  show of protest against the participation in the festival of Zhang Yimou's  film "To Live," which has not received Beijing's approval.
"To Live," by the director of the 1991 hit "Raise the Red Lantern," tells  the story of three generations of a family living through the China of the  1940s, 50s and 60s, including the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural  Revolution.
The film, considered a contender for the festival's highest prize, the  Golden Palm, was not approved by Chinese censors. It was, however, presented  in Cannes Tuesday despite the film-maker's absence, who was in Beijing trying  to persuade officials to approve the film.
Yin Li's film "The history of Xinghua" was shown Friday night.
