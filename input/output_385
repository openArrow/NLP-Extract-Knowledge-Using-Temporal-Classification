A woman who lost her job as a perfume demonstrator  because of alleged body odor told a court hearing her wrongful dismissal  lawsuit that the incident made people see her as "this smelly person."
Sharon Bagnall told an Ontario Court judge that she was humiliated by the  April 1991 dismissal by Calvin Klein Cosmetics.
"No one sees that I'm a wife, a mother, that I have a life," Bagnall told  Judge Lee Ferrier. "They just see this smelly person."
The Canadian subsidiary of the US-based firm maintained that Bagnall's  odor created a persistent problem for other employees.
Arguments ended Friday and a ruling was expected in June.
