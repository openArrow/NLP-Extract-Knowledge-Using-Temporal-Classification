India will be blessed with a generous monsoon  for the seventh year in a row, the weather office has predicted, boosting  hopes of an economic turnaround pinned on the benevolence of the weather gods.
The meterological department's monsoon forecast on Thursday had been  anxiously awaited by government policy-makers, corporate barons, farmers and  consumers since the February 28 annual budget announcement.
The department offered good tidings, saying India could expect "normal"  southwest monsoon rains of about 85 centimetres (34 inches) in June-September,  plus or minus four percent.
The monsoon has already set in over the Andaman Sea and would reach the  southern mainland on time by June 1, the weather bureau said to the relief of  all in the country of 900 million people.
After being stricken by the century's worst drought in 1987, caused by a  20-percent rain shortfall, it would be the seventh straight year that India  would experience a normal monsoon.
The meteorological department's rain forecasts -- which take into account  16 global and regional weather indicators -- have proved accurate in past  years.
Good rains are particularly crucial for India this year as Finance  Minister Manmohan Singh expects to pull the economy out of stagnation by  jump-starting industry and boosting farm exports.
The minister risked a high fiscal deficit of about 19 billion dollars in  his 1994-1995 budget package by increasing spending to stimulate the economy,  setting a five percent growth target.
A good monsoon would give his growth-oriented fiscal package a better  chance of success, help douse inflation of 11 percent, stop traders from  hoarding and lessen central bank constraints in making credit policy.
Industry, emerging from a two-year recession, has been praying for  plentiful rains as it chases an eight percent growth target set for it by  Singh.
