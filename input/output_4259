The dollar hovered early Thursday near its  closing levels of the day before in New York in a slow market as traders  hesitated in the absence of any trend and before the long US Memorial Day  holiday weekend.
Gold, meanwhile, fell to 385.10 dollars an ounce, down 1.50 dollar from  late Wednesday.
At about 9:40 a.m. (1340 GMT), the dollar traded at 1.6430 German marks,  down from 1.6445 late Wednesday, and at 104.35 yen (104.37).
At mid-session in London, the US currency was quoted at 1.6420 marks and  104.30 yen.
The dollar fell to 5.6182 French francs from 5.6270 late Wednesday, to  1.4015 Swiss francs (1.4030) and to 0.6624 pound sterling (0.6625).
Traders were awaiting the publication Friday of the government's first  revision of its gross domestic product estimate for the first quarter. Experts  believe the economy grew 2.4 percent, slightly lower than the initial estimate  of a 2.6 percent expansion.
Jim Moore, a trader with American Security Bank, said trading was very  slow and the dollar would probably move within a tight margin between 1.6425  and 1.6475 marks for the rest of the day.
