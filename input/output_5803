Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev on Tuesday  defended Moscow's right to sell arms to Iran, criticizing calls for Russia to  ban arms trade with other countries.
Cited by the Interfax news agency, he said that calls for Russia not to  sell arms to Iran "not only does not correspond with the partnership with our  western allies, but recalls the worst in our joint histroy."
The US administration has expressed concern several times in recent months  about Russian arms sales. In particular Washington last year called on Moscow  withdraw a delivery of three submarines ordered by Iran in 1992.
Speaking to a visiting delegation of US lawmakers led by Senator Sam Nunn,  Kozyrev called for Russia and America to "work together to establish common  regulations on arms exports."
Kozyrev's spokesman Gregory Karassin meanwhile denied that Moscow had  supplied arms to either side in Yemen conflict. "Russia has never been  involved in supplying arms to Yemen, directly or indirectly," he told  reporters.
