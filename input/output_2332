Outside Onassis' apartment building in Manhattan, a crowd of mourners  braved the rain.
"I'm sad she passed away but I am happy because I think she didn't  suffer," said Jane Calder, 30, after leaving some white roses with the  doorman. It was the first of many bouquets of flowers left overnight for  Onassis.
Another woman said she dropped everything and immediately came to Onassis'  building after hearing the news of her death at 10:15 p.m. (02015 GMT).
"We love her, she was a great lady all the way," she said.
