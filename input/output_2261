"Sinn Fein asks what comes next. Certainly no further playing for time. If  the Joint Declaration is 'the starting point of a peace process' the next step  is for violence to end for good".
The organisation now faced a clear choice between entering the political  process by renouncing violence -- or isolation, the response warned.
And it stated: "There is no conceivable justification for continuing to  rob people of their lives, least of all a call for a textual explanation of  the Joint Declaration."
Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds said the reply should "help to clear  the road".
He was supported by Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, who said  London has made "a very serious effort" to meet Sinn Fein's concerns.
"Sinn Fein should be able to welcome it... We feel very strongly that this  effort by the British government should end the logjam".
Press reaction Friday was also generally positive. A Guardian leader said  Thursday's public dialogue represented "genuine progress" which "should not be  underestimated merely because the dialogue thus far is very cagey and  self-protective".
But editorial in the Times was pessimistic, saying the clarification was  "pointless".
"The Government may claim that yesterday's response has laid the  troublesome ghost of 'clarification' to rest once and for all. Sinn Fein's  interpretation will surely be just the opposite: that the preconditions  required by the declaration are not absolute and that negotiation by stealth  remains an option," it said, adding that "the determination of the men of  violence to continue their work could not be clearer."
Since the signing of the declaration more than 30 have died in sectarian  violence between republican Catholics fighting British rule in Northern  Ireland and Protestant loyalists seeking to retain it.
