The Moslem-dominated Bosnian army launched  artillery and infantry assaults against Serb-held areas in northeastern Bosnia  on Friday, the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA said here.
More than 100 tank shells rained down on the Serb village of Priboj on  Friday morning, wounding two civilians and seriously damaging houses, the  agency said.
Bosnian forces also shelled the Stolice television relay station as ground  troops attempted to breach Serb lines, but were rebuffed by Serb defenders,  SRNA added. The station changed hands twice last week.
Government gunners also shelled the Serb-controlled town of Doboj, around  80 kilometres (50 miles) north of Sarajevo, forcing civilians into shelters,  the Belgrade-based Tanjug news agency said.
Bosnian army shelling there Thursday wounded eight civilians, five  seriously, the agency said.
Radio Sarajevo meanwhile reported a combined Serb artillery and infantry  assault around Gradacac, northeast of Doboj.
Separately, UN Protection Force spokesman Major Rob Annink, said the  commander of Serb forces in the eastern Moslem enclave of Gorazde had been  "unavailable" during a visit to the UN-declared "safe haven" Thursday by UN  Bosnia commander Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose.
However, he denied that the Serbs, who are still refusing to withdraw 150  soldiers from a three-kilometre (1.5-mile) exclusion zone around Gorazde, were  avoiding the British commander. Rose met the deputy Serb commander in Gorazde.
Serb forces were ordered to pull back from Gorazde town centre in February  by the United Nations, or face air strikes.
