Deposed president Carlos Andres Perez was jailed  Wednesday after the Supreme Court ordered his detention while he awaits trial  on charges of misappropriating millions of dollars in public funds.
The court ordered the arrests of Perez, former cabinet ministers Reinaldo  Figueredo and Alejandro Izaguirre, said chief justice Roberto Yepes Boscan.
Perez turned himself in to the Supreme Court accompanied by his daughter  Martha after the decision, insisting he was the victim of a huge conspiracy.
The 71-year-old fomrer president arrived at the El Junquito jail -- which  is reserved for government officials -- in a Cadillac, proclaiming his  innocence and charging that his arrest was political motivated.
"Those who could not overthow me or force me to resign unleashed an  implacable campaign to force to leave the presidency and then put me on  trial," he said.
Izaguirre was jailed along with Perez. The former president is entitled to  house arrest because of his advanced age, but he is not requesting it.
The 11-4 court ruling clears the way for a formal trial against Perez and  his aides.
Perez was suspended from office in May 1993 and then removed in August of  the same year on charges he misappropriated 17.2 million dollars withdrawn  from a secret Interior Ministry fund at the beginning of his second term in  1989.
The Supreme Court began proceedings May 20 against the former president  and his two cabinet ministers, who were accused of withdrawing the money from  the fund, converting it into dollars and then keeping difference when the  bolivar was subsequently devalued.
Perez has insisted the funds were used for national security purposes that  he cannot disclose and his lawyers say it is up to the court to prove that the  money was misappropriated.
