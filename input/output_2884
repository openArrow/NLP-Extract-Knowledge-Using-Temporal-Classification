Bosnian Croat forces shelled the Serb-held  Bosnian town of Brcko in northern Bosnia, injuring five people and causing  major material damage, the Belgrade news agency Tanjug said Sunday.
One of the injured had to have a leg amputated after six shells rained  down from Croat lines at Orasje, some eight kilometres (five miles) to the  west of the town centre late Saturday, Tanjug said.
The Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA said the Croats had used multiple  shell-launchers.
The bombardment followed an artillery barrage against Serb positions  situated to the north-west of Brcko, dubbed the Serbian Gibraltar by the  Belgrade press. The town forms part of a corridor linking Serb-held regions of  Bosnia and Croatia to Serbia.
Troops from the mainly Moslem Bosnian government Saturday bombarded Gornji  Vakuf, a Serb-held town in central Bosnia, Tanjug reported, quoting Serbian  military sources.
The town, on the main route linking southern and central Bosnia, has been  under artillery attack from government forces for three days, the agency said.
