Shares in the Dutch state-owned postal and  telecommunications business are to be quoted in privatised form for the first  time on June 13 and are likely to be priced at 46-52 guilder each, the  ABN-Amro bank said on Monday.
The bank is lead manager of the syndicate handling the introduction of  shares in Koninklijke PTT Nederland (KPN). It is the biggest introduction ever  made in The Netherlands.
Since January 1 KPN has been managed as a private company in preparation  for privatisation.
The bank said that the final price of the shares would be set on June 6  when the books would be opened for subscription until June 9. The offer is  open to Dutch and foreign investors.
About 138.15 million shares are to be issued in a first stage representing  30 percent of the equity, the bank said. The banks have the right to issue a  further 20.7 million shares during the following 30 days.
The state plans to sell about 66 percent of the company in three or four  stages. KPN is estimated to be worth a total of 18-28 billion guilder  (9.5-14.8 billion dollars).
