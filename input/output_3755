China has completed a preliminary study on  building a 55-nautical-mile series of bridges and a tunnel that would run from  the northeastern city of Lushun (Port Arthur) across the Bohai sea to Penglai.
The project, which would be the world's longest, would run north and  south, dividing the Bohai sea from the Yellow Sea, a route so far traversable  only by ferry, the Beijing-run Wen Wei Po newspaper reported. It would link 20  islands beween Shandong province and Liaoning peninsula.
The scheme, which would be open to traffic by 2010, would include an  undersea tunnel, seven bridges and two low-lying bridges that would barely  skim the water's surface.
Chinese experts said in their one-year preliminary study that the project  would be of historic proportions and "enhance the strength of the nation," Wen  Wei Po said.
The project is estimated to cost up to 60 billion yuan (10 billion  dollars).
A second study has been ordered by the Chinese authorities.
