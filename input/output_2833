Betsy King carded her second  consecutive two-under-par 70 here Saturday to inch into a one-shot lead after  two rounds of the Lady Keystone golf tournament.
Overnight pacesetter Missie Berteotti squandered a three-shot lead with a  second-round 75 to let King through with a total of 140.
Berteotti was in the group of four golfers who shared second on 141, along  with England's Laura Davies (71), Val Skinner (71) and Elaine Crosby (72).
King got off to a rocky start with a two-putt bogey at the first. She  pulled that shot back at the fifth, and made the turn at one-under thanks to a  birdie at the ninth.
She parred her way through the 15th, birdied the 16th, then saved par with  a 15-footer from the fringe at 17.
Berteotti never recovered from three bogeys in her first five holes.
Davies, who has won the last two events on the LPGA Tour, including the  prestigous LPGA Championship last seek, missed an opportunity to share the  lead when she took bogey at the par-five 16th.
Skinner, the defending champion, stayed in the hunt despite a double bogey  at the fourth. She got the shots back with birdies at 14 and 16.
