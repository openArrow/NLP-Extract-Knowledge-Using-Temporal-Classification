Florida's governor has rejected a  bill that would have guaranteed parents the right to spank their youngsters,  saying it might make detecting child abuse tougher.
Lawton Chiles vetoed the legislation Friday, saying that the bill's  wording could have made it too difficult to prosecute cases of child abuse.
But he also said the state had to balance parents' rights and the  protection of children, and urged state lawmakers to draft a revised bill at a  special legislative session next month.
