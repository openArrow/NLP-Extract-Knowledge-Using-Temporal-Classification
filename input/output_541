Jonassaint's swearing-in by a Senate faction not recognized by the  international community was immediately condemned by the UN Security Council  and foreign governments as illegitimate.
The United States, France and other countries involved in the effort to  restore democracy in Haiti declared that deposed president Jean-Bertrand  Aristide, ousted by the military in 1991, was the country's only legitimate  and democratically elected president.
Cedras said the military were willing to negotiate and he hoped Clinton's  new envoy to Haiti, William Gray, would approach the conflict with an open  mind.
"I want to believe that he would come in a spirit of justice, in an open  spirit, to understand the Haitian problem and to understand that truth is not  really what is being said," said Cedras.
He also criticized reports that animals were eating human corpses left in  the streets and that the armed forces are responsible for human rights abuses.
"I would like to know the motivation, the reason," for these reports, said  Cedras, adding that the reports were blown out of proportion.
"They take these facts and these crimes and give them a political matter,"  insisted Cedras.
