Pete Sampras' dream of a fourth consecutive Grand  Slam title turned into a nightmare on the treacherous red clay of the Roland  Garros centre-court here on Tuesday.
The world number-one, winner of last year's Wimbledon, United States Open  and this year's Australian Open, was beaten in four sets by his old buddy and  rival Jim Courier in a big-hitting quarter-final duel spread over nearly three  and a half hours on the hottest day of the tournament so far.
Courier, who grinded out a 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, 6-4 win, now plays defending  champion Sergi Bruguera or Andrei Medvedev of the Ukraine in Friday's  semi-finals.
Sampras, 22, a quarter-finalist here for the last two years, had  confidently been expecting to reach the semi-finals for the first time. He had  beaten Courier ten times in twelve encounters, two of the victories coming  this year, and he had finally appeared to have mastered the gruelling surface  by dropping only one set since the Championships began.
But Courier was in no mood to surrender in an event played on what he  considers very much his own territory.
The 23-year-old American, champion in 1991 and 1992 and still under the  wing of crafty Spanish coach Jose Higueras, kept Sampras back with his  baseline slogging and the world number-one was not helped by his serve.  Although he hammered down ten aces, he also hit as many double-faults.
Courier, who looked the fresher of the two, made a vital move when he  broke Sampras for a fifth and final time in the seventh game of the fourth  set. And he poured salt on Sampras' wounds by immediately holding his own  serve to love.
There was no way back for Sampras.
