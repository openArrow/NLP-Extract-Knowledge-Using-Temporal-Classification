The dollar was mixed Monday in quiet trading  ahead of this week's meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee,  which is expected to raise short-term interest rates.
The ounce of gold fell 70 cents to 380 dollars from Friday's close.
Around 1:00 p.m. (1700 GMT), the dollar was trading at 1.6740 German marks  against 1.6725 at the open and 1.6695 Friday in New York.
The dollar traded at 104.70 yen against 104.37 yen at the open and 105.00  yen Friday.
The greenback was mixed against the other major European currencies,  trading at 5.7400 French francs against 5.7260 Friday and 1.4265 Swiss francs  against 1.4260, but at 0.6658 pounds sterling against 0.6671 pounds.
Trading was expected to be very light for the remainder of the day, said  Ed Neminski, a dealer with Nomura Securities.
Operators expect the dollar to benefit from a half-point rise in the  overnight inter-bank rate by the Fed, which meets Tuesday.
