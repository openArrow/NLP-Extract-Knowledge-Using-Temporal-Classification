European racers are having trouble  finding competitive cars to qualify for the Indianapolis 500 just one year  after seven of them started in the 33-car field.
Arie Luyendyk of the Netherlands took second last May and England's Nigel  Mansell led before being caught off-guard on a restart and finishing third.
Italy's Teo Fabi was ninth, with Sweden's Stefan Johansson two spots  farther back in 1993. France's Stefan Gregoire, Belgium's Didier Theys and  Scotland's Jim Crawford also were still running at the finish.
Mansell and 1990 Indy winner Luyendyk will be third-row starters this year  in the May 29 race, but Fabi is in row nine and Johansson in row 10.
"It has been a bit of a struggle, but we're up to reasonable speed,"  Johansson said.
"We've been battling to find it. Lately, I have felt like a passenger. But  we got the car more comfortable and that helped me get some confidence back."
Fabi's team waved off his pole-day effort after seeing two slow laps, but  his third lap showed him with more than enough power to make the field safely.  The mistake condemned Fabi to a rear starting slot.
"It is very difficult to get over it," Fabi said. "I had a good car and  expected good things to happen."
Fabi, like many former Formula-One drivers on the Indy car circuit, finds  Indianapolis his toughest challenge.
"It's probably the most difficult race you do," Fabi said. "This is the  only race where I don't sleep the night before because you're anxious and  worried."
