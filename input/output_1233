Chinese director Zhang Yimou is boycotting  the Cannes Film Festival in protest at his country's censorship of his film  "Huozhe" (To Live) a statement said Tuesday.
The statement was read out by producer Chiu Fusheng at the start of a  press conference ahead of the premiere of the movie, widely tipped to do well  here.
"Because my film, "To Live", has still not received its censors' visa in  China, I am unable to come to the Cannes festival. I regret this very much,"  the statement said.
"I am very happy that "To Live" is being presented here. I thank festival  director Gilles Jacob, and all those who will see the film." The statement was  addressed to Jacob.
The film, by the director of the 1991 hit "Raise the Red Lantern," tells  the story of three generations of a family living through the China of the  1940s, 50s and 60s, including the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural  Revolution.
The press conference was also attended by actress Gong Li, a long-time  associate of Zhang and star of last year's joint Golden Palm winner, "Farewell  to My Concubine."
Festival organizers were not immediately available for comment on the  statement.
