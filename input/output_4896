Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan has raised the  possibility of group members joining the Cambodian government and armed forces  in a speech during peace talks in Pyongyang.
In the speech dated Friday, and obtained here Saturday, Khieu Samphan said  Cambodia should set up a framework "to be used as the basis for the formation  of the national government and the unified national army which include all the  Cambodian national parties."
The government has yet to give a statement on the progress of the talks  which started Friday and are scheduled to last until Monday. Officials said no  other information was available outside Pyongyang.
King Norodom Sihanouk is hosting the talks between co-premiers Prince  Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, parliament chairman Chea Sim and Khieu Samphan  at his residence near the North Korean capital.
The talks are based on a peace plan proposed by King Sihanouk six months  ago that would give the Khmer Rouge government posts in return for ceasing  guerrilla activities. They would have to open up their zones and merge their  fighters with the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces.
The Khmer Rouge earlier expressed support for a ceasefire proposed by the  king and the setting up of a joint ceasefire commission. But the group said  final approval would be dependent on the participation of international  observers.
Prince Ranariddh and Hun Sen have already agreed to a ceasefire if the two  sides fail to reach a political solution at the talks and suggested June 15 as  a starting date.
The rebels, however, accused the government Friday of undermining the  peace process by seeking foreign military aid, citing the visit of a US  defence official as evidence that Washington wanted to arm Phnom Penh.
