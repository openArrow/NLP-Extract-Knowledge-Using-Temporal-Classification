Poachers have reduced the rhinoceros population  of India's Manas National Park in the northeastern state of Assam to just four  from 100 seven years ago, forest department officials said Friday.
Tigers, elephants and other animals have also been targeted by poachers in  the park along India's border with Bhutan, the officials told the Press Trust  of India.
He said that only about 20 tigers remained in the park, down from 40  several years ago.
Rhinoceros horn and tiger parts fetch large sums of money in Taiwan, Hong  Kong and China, where they are used as ingredients in traditional medicines  and as aphrodisiacs.
