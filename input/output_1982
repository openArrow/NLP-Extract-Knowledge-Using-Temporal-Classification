Malaysia is likely to lift soon a three-month  boycott of British firms and may announce the decision during a visit here  next month by British Trade Minister Richard Needham, government sources said  on Thursday.
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is believed to have already agreed to end  the ban, following recent consultations with British Premier John Major, they  said.
"We expect some kind of announcement sometime next month when Needham  leads a trade delegation here on June 5," said a source.
Officials declined to comment.
"Both premiers have been in consultations. That much I can say," said  Bruce Cleghorn, the deputy high commissioner of the British High Commission  (embassy) here.
Malaysia on February 25 announced an immediate ban on British firms from  bidding for government contracts, angered by allegations in the British media  of financial wrongdoings in Anglo-Malaysian trade and in Mahathir's  administration.
London's Sunday Times was singled out for its February 20 article alleging  links between Mahathir and a British construction firm, Wimpey International.
British officials have been urging Malaysia to lift the ban, estimated to  cost British firms millions of dollars in lost contracts, but Mahathir has  said the government would relent only if the British media "stopped their  lies."
British High Commissioner to Malaysia Duncan Slater said last month that  the media in his country had stopped writing "unfair reports" about Malaysia  and its leaders, and expressed hope "to get things back to normal."
On April 5, British Secretarary of State for Education John Patten, made a  pitch to mend the rift by pledging London's full support for Malaysia's plan  to become a regional centre of education excellence.
Patten was the first British minister to visit Kuala Lumpur since the ban  was announced.
