Controversial South African immigrant Jan Smith  says he is not a white supremacist and never has been.
Smith arrived last month after being granted a residence permit and since  then has been the target of anti-apartheid demonstrators in Auckland, where he  lives.
In his first public comment, an interview published Saturday in the  Dominion newspaper, he was quoted as saying: "I would like to deny absolutely  that I have ever been a white supremacist. I never will be. I never came to  New Zealand with any idea whatsoever to get involved in politics or religion  or any controversial matter."
Smith was reported to have been the head of a white supremacist  organisation in South Africa called the Church of the Creator. Allegations  published here include that he once wrote a document saying the white race was  "threatened by our deadly race enemies -- Jews, Kaffirs and the mud races."
In the interview, Smith said he had totally disassociated himself from the  church and did not know whether it still existed.
He did not directly admit even being a member of that organisation but  said in the interview extremist views in South Africa were common because of  the situation there.
New Zealand Immigration Minister Roger Maxwell said Friday there were no  legal grounds for revoking Smith's residence permit.
