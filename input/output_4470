An apparent attempt to launder gold bullion  reputedly hidden by former Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos via a bogus  gold mine in the Cook Islands is revealed in a soon-to-be published book, a  business magazine reported Friday.
The author, Ray Smith, founded Goldcorp, a bullion company which went into  receivership in July 1988. His book, "Where's the Gold?", goes on sale next  week, National Business Review said.
The Cook Islands is a semi-independent South Pacific state 3,000  kilometers (1,860 miles) northeast of here. It operates a controversial  tax-haven banking system.
NBR says Smith claimed the Cook Islands government approached him in 1987  with a plan to process 1,200 tonnes of Marcos gold. He had been in Rarotonga  for discussions about minting a gold coin for the government.
Smith said the government had apparently been approached on behalf of  Marcos with a plan to set up a bogus mine in the Cooks, where there were  traces of gold, and to pretend to "mine" the Marcos stash.
"Our role was to set up the mine, build a small refinery to process the  gold ... and then to deal the now legitimate gold on to the world market," the  book says.
The Cooks were selected, Smith says, because the people behind the idea  wanted "some little out-of-the-way country that needs a couple of hundred  million dollars to shut them up."
Smith says he was to get four percent of an estimated 15 billion US  dollars in gold.
He told NBR it was a huge deal, although he was skeptical.
"It sounds incredibly exciting but you've got to understand -- in the  bullion industry the Marcos gold used to come up twice a year with everybody."
