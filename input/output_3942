A former militant fascist who fought for Benito  Mussolini's short-lived fascist rump state at the end of World War II was  named Wednesday to head parliament's foreign affairs committee, officials said.
Mirko Tremaglia, 67, joined aged 17 the ranks of the Nazi-backed northern  Italian Social Republic formed by Mussolini at Salo in 1943.
Tremaglia has since 1946 been a member of the Italian Social Movement  (MSI), the main constituent of the neo-fascist National Alliance that is part  of new Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's governing coalition.
Speaking to AFP after his appointment as chairman of the chamber of  deputies committee was announced, Tremaglia admitted his wartime allegiances  but added: "Fascism is dead."
The MSI's policy had always been one of "denying nothing and restoring  nothing" in terms of Italy's fascist past, and that stance was "still valid,"  he added.
The appointment of five Alliance ministers in Berlusconi's fledgling  adminstration provoked outrage among Italy's European Union allies. National  Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini has described dictator Mussolini as the  greatest statesman of the century.
