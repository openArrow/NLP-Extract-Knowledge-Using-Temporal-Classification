Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has  refused ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky's request that his  Liberal Democratic Party be part of the cabinet, Interfax reported Friday.
The agency, citing a well-informed government source, said Chernomyrdin  held a 20-minute meeting Thursday with Zhirinovsky, who suggested his party be  given the defense and interior portfolios, or the justice portfolio which  includes the post of prosecutor general, or the ministries of economy and  privatisation.
Chernomyrdin reportedly rejected Zhirinovsky's "demands" telling him the  cabinet was not set up on the basis of political representation but rather on  the basis of "professional ability," Interfax said.
