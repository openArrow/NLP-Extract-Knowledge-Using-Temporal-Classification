Germany's midfield general Lothar Matthaus, who has  won almost everything in the game, is the ideal man to lead a European team to  World Cup success outside the continent.
Only Brazil in 1958 in Sweden, have done the ultimate -- win the world  title outside their native land mass.
Rugged skipper Matthaus has won the World Cup, the Italian League with  Inter Milan in 1989, and, earlier this month, took the German title with  Bayern Munich.
A UEFA Cup win with Inter in 1991 was a further triumph for the  33-year-old sweeper, who has been German, European and World footballer of the  year. He even became World Sportsman of the Year after Germany's 1990 World  Cup win.
Only a European Nations Cup victory has eluded Matthaus.
Only a fool would completely rule out Matthaus' chances of leading Germany  to victory outside Europe this year for a further famous footnote in his  footballing CV.
Matthaus shot to worldwide fame when he struck the winner from a free-kick  against Morocco in the second round of the 1986 World Cup in Mexico.
And though he had a broken wrist, he was given the unenviable task of  marking Argentina's genius, Diego Maradona, at the height of his career in the  final. Though Germany lost 3-2, perhaps significantly, Maradona was not on the  scoresheet.
A relentless, ball-winner and grafter with immense courage, Matthaus  encapsulates Germany's architypal player -- technically skillful, yet robust  physically. A ferocious shot ensured he scored goals, many from set pieces,  which would yet further boost his reputation.
