Denying China most-favoured-nation (MFN) trading  status is not in the US interest, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said here  Thursday.
Singapore and Malaysia, meanwhile, added that MFN should not be linked to  human rights as the United States insists.
Responding to questions at a business conference, Li said: "MFN is  mutually beneficial and the basis for our bilateral trading relationship. The  granting of MFN status and preservation of MFN treatment is of fundamental  interest to our two countries."
Singaporean Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and Malaysian Deputy Premier  Anwar Ibrahim, who addressed the conference after Li, criticised Washington  for linking trade to human rights.
Their comments came as reports from Washington suggested US President Bill  Clinton was considering partial withdrawal of China's trading privileges. He  must decide on his course of action by June 3.
Clinton said last year that he would not renew China's MFN status unless  Beijing made "significant overall progress" on human rights, a position  critised by some Asian nations worried that a withdrawal would cause economic  and political harm.
Beijing has warned that it would retaliate if MFN is withdrawn, and  Chinese Premier Li Peng said earlier this week that China would not tolerate  interference in its internal affairs.
Li Lanqing said he had not heard of proposals for limited penalties on  Chinese exports as an alternative to total withdrawal of MFN but commented  that the privilege was "mutually beneficial" and important for bilateral  trade.
