Three people have had sex-change operations in  Belarus, the first to be performed in the former Soviet republic, the  ITAR-TASS news agency quoted medical officials in Minsk as saying Tuesday.
The three, aged 21 and 22, underwent the surgery free of charge, according  to the surgeon, professor Vladimir Podgaiski.
Podgaiski, who received three months of training in Moscow prior to the  operations, said the work was no more complicated than reattaching a severed  finger.
