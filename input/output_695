If you care about keeping your car in one  piece, don't feed the mountain parrots, the New Zealand Automobile Association  (AA) warns motorists travelling in alpine areas.
The parrots, or keas (nestor notobilis), have become a major tourist  attraction, but they become so keyed up by high-calorie human food that they  rip cars up, the AA's monthly magazine Directions reports in its latest issue.
"With a quick fuel-up of human food, the kea is all set as far as eating  goes and can spend the rest of the day investigating the multitude of  interesting things associated with helpful humans."
Under natural conditions a kea will spend its entire day looking for plant  and insect material.
The raucous, inquisitive 46-centimeter-long (18.4-inch-long) olive green  parrots can be "incredibly effective at causing damage," especially to cars,  the AA said.
"Their toys include boots, tents, packs, windscreen rubber seals, car  wiper blades, ski roof racks, car sunroof rubber surrounds, car aerials,  clothing, ski tower padding, wiring for lights ..." which they can rip with  their beaks.
The AA recommends that people parking cars in areas inhabited by keas keep  netting available to cover them.
The birds have been seen with their claws loosely hooked on steeply  sloping high tension cables, sliding down the wire at great speeds with  excited screeching, and then flying back up the hill for another go.
The keas' strength, their ability to move both parts of their beaks, their  versatile feet, harsh home environment and lack of natural enemies means they  are not afraid of people.
"All of this adds up to how a kea can be incredibly effective at causing  damage," the AA said.
