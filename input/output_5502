Yves Saint Laurent president Pierre Berge was  indicted here on Monday for insider dealing over the sale of 120,000 shares in  the luxury goods company worth 17.8 million dollars.
Berge was charged along with former YSL financial director Jean-Francis  Bretelle. The two were also accused of breaching a stockbrokers' monopoly on  sales of quoted shares by selling them privately to a Swiss company between  July and the middle of September, 1992.
An examining magistrate who indicted the two also heard couturier Yves  Saint Laurent as a witness on Monday.
The shares were sold before publication of poor YSL results on September  21, 1992, which could constitute insider dealing, judicial sources said.
