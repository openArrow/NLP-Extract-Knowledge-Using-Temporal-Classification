New Zealand's second one-day international against  England at Lord's was finally abandoned on Sunday morning.
Another night of heavy rain ended all hope of any play, which meant  England took the one-day trophy by virtue of their 42-run victory over the  Kiwis in Birmingham on Thursday.
It is the first time a one-day international in England, involving the  home country, has been washed out without a ball being bowled since  limited-over matches began 22 years ago.
The only other complete blank came during the 1979 World Cup when West  Indies and Sri Lanka were rained off at The Oval.
