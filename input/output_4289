The German and Russian military are planning joint  manoeuvres on Russian soil next year and on German soil in 1996, German  defence ministry sources said Thursday.
Warships of the two countries' naval forces are already to hold joint  manoeuvres this year in the Baltic Sea.
Legislation permitting former eastern bloc forces to exercise on German  soil will first have to be passed, after the legislative elections of October  16, a defence ministry spokesman said.
Germany is also seeking military cooperation accords with the Baltic  states of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, and these are expected to be  concluded in September, the sources said.
The accords will provide for joint manoeuvres and aid in training.
A pilot exercise is to be held October in Denmark between German, Polish  and Danish forces, while the German navy is to hold a minesweeping exercise  with Polish and Danish vessels in the Baltic Sea in September.
