Bosnian Serb troops have made a small advance in  the western pocket of Bihac following intense shelling of the region, a UN  commander stationed in Bihac said Thursday.
Major Jean-Francois Philippe, spokesman for the French battalion based in  the Moslem-held city, said the Serbs advanced by about a kilometre (less than  a mile) in the southeastern part of the pocket Wednesday after launching a  barrage of 500 shells against positions of the mainly-Moslem Bosnian army  stationed north of the city.
The Serbs also reportedly launched infantry assaults on several villages  north of Bihac, a UN-declared "safe haven."
Philippe said the Serbs want to reclaim territory captured by the Bosnian  army along the Una river and a railway line that runs nearby.
According to Bosnian military sources, the army still controls some 40  kilometres (25 miles) of the railway line, which is crucial to the Serbs who  are trying to link the separatist Croatian region of Krajina with the  Serb-held stronghold of Banja Luka, in western Bosnia.
The Serbs have also started building a railway line in order to link the  northeastern Bosnian town of Brcko with the nearby town of Bijeljina and  Serbia proper.
Philippe said the situation in Bihac was calm Thursday although clashes  erupted Wednesday evening between government forces and troops loyal to Moslem  separatist leader Fikret Abdic, who has brokered his own ceasefire with the  Serbs in areas he controls.
Elsewhere in Bosnia Thursday, the army was pursuing its offensive against  Serb troops in the northern town of Tesanj but UN observers stationed in the  region said they had not detected any territorial gains.
In the eastern town of Gorazde, meanwhile, Serb commanders were still  refusing to pull armed troops from a UN-imposed three-kilometre (1.8-mile)  exclusion zone around the city.
Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, the commander of UN troops in Bosnia,  met Wednesday with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in an attempt to  convince him to pull government troops from the east bank of the Drina River,  which runs through Gorazde, UN Protection Force spokesman Robert Annink said.
He said the retreat is the Serbs' "condition for withdrawing from the  three-kilometre zone."
Annink added that although a UN resolution on Gorazde does not call for  troops withdrawal, the belligerants must "make a step to show their good  faith."
The Serbs last weekend ignored a pledge they had made to pull their armed  forces from the three-kilometre zone.
In other developments Thursday, three field clinics donated by Britain  began operating in Mostar, in southern Bosnia-Hercegovina, devastated by  fighting between Moslems and Croats before both sides agreed a federation plan  earlier this year.
