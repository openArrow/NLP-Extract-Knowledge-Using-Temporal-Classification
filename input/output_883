The dollar firmed against the main European  currencies early on Monday before a meeting of the US Federal Reserve's  policy-making Open Markets Committee on Tuesday which is thought likely to  raise interest rates.
By mid morning, the dollar was being traded at 1.6765 marks from 1.6680 at  the close on Friday.
At Paribas Capital Markets analyst Richard Turnhill said that the dollar  was being supported by "encouraging US statistics last week showing inflation  remains under control, and on expectations of a 50-basis-point rise in the US  discount rate and the federal funds rate" which is the interest charged on  overnight interbank loans.
Dealers were also waiting for US industrial production figures for April  later in the day.
The dollar fell slightly against the yen to 104.75 yen from 104.85 at the  close in London.
Turnhill said that the yen remained fragile on "continuing signs of  weakness in the Japanese economy and signs that trade tensions might be easing  slightly", after Washington had announced on Friday the resumption of  US-Japanese trade discussions this week.
He added that the Bank of Japan had probably intervened overnight on the  Asian market to sell yen for dollars.
The strength of the dollar weighed on the mark which fell to 3.4295 French  francs from 3.4315 at the close on Friday  but remained stable at 958.8 lire.
The pound was firm after a 0.3 percent monthly rise in British output  prices in April, and an annual increase of 2.2 percent. This was the weakest  increase since December 1986.
By mid morning the pound was being traded at 1.5003 dollars from 1.4990 at  the close on Friday, at 2.5153 marks from 2.5003, at 157.23 yen from 157.17,  at 2.1457 Swiss francs from 2.1376, and at 8.6289 French francs from 8.5687.
The dollar was being quoted at 1.6765 marks from 1.6680, at 104.75 yen  from 104.85, at 1.4295 Swiss francs from 1.4260, and at 5.7488 French francs  from 5.7162.
In Paris, the dollar was also higher, while the mark remained unchanged  from the close on Friday at 3.4295 French francs. The market changed little  before the meeting of the US Federal Reserve on Tuesday.
The market was also expecting the Bank of France to cut its key interest  rates, to follow the 0.5 point cut in the Bundesbank's two key interest rates  -- the Lombard and the discount rate -- on Wednesday, said a trader.
By mid morning the mark was at 3.4295 French francs from 3.4300 at the  close on Friday.
The dollar was being traded at 5.7489 French francs from 5.7250 at the  close on Friday, at 1.6768 marks from 1.6695 and at 104.75 yen from 104.80.
The pound was sharply higher at 8.6231 French francs from 8.5806.
