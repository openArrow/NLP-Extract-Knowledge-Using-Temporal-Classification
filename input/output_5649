South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-Joo hinted  Tuesday that Seoul could seek sanctions against Pyongyang outside the United  Nations framework if China used its veto right in favor of the North.
Meanwhile, local press reports quoted an unidentified Seoul official as  saying North Korea had removed 60 percent of the spent fuel rods from a five  megatwatt reactor in Yongbyon, 90 kilometers (56 miles) north of Pyongyang.
Given the current speed in replacing the fuel rods, North Korea is only  two days away from destroying the evidence needed to determine whether it had  diverted plutonium for weapons, the official said.
Asked whether South Korea could seek sanctions outside the framework of  the UN along with Western nations in an effort to break the nuclear standoff,  Han said he thought it may not be necessary as China had joined UN calls for  North Korea to allow full inspections.
"However, the government is making preparations for every possible  scenario," Han said.
Han's remarks followed a UN Security Council statement urging Pyongyang to  "proceed with the discharge operations at the five megawatt reactor in a  manner which preserves the technical possibility of fuel measurements," in  Yongbyon.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) earlier said if the  refuelling continued in a way that did not conform to their requirements, the  North would destroy evidence which could verify whether or not it had or was  diverting plutonium for bombs.
Asked whether the North crossed the point of no return in changing the  fuel rods, Han stressed there had been no report to that effect, adding that  two IAEA inspectors were still at the suspect nuclear reactor site.
