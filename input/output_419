A radical Islamic daily on Saturday protested  against a visit by a group of US newspaper editors and said it would boycott a  meeting between the journalists and representatives of the Iranian press.
The chief-editors of 13 US newspapers and magazines arrived here earlier  this week on a three-day visit to "raise their understanding of present-day  Iran," a US journalist told AFP.
They have already held several meetings with representatives of the  Iranian media and were to meet Saturday with the editors-in-chief of the press  in Tehran.
"It is not clear who invited the American editors to Iran and why the  culture ministry has arranged a meeting between them and Iranian  chief-editors," said Jomhuri Islami, a daily close to Islamic hardliners.
The paper warned that the meeting could be a "ploy" by Washington to try  and reopen talks with Iran through an indirect channel.
Tehran and Washington broke diplomatic ties in 1980 after radical students  stormed the US embassy here and took its staff hostage.
The United States has called several times for direct negotiations, but  the two sides have yet to make a breakthrough. Islamic hardliners are fiercely  opposed to any talks with Washington.
