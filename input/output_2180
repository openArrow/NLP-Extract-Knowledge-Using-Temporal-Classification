Four jailed members of the leftwing extremist group  Action Directe serving life terms for murder received another life term  Thursday at a court in Paris.
Under the new term they will only become eligible for parole after serving  18 years of the sentence.
The four, Nathalie Menigon, Joelle Aubron, Jean-Marc Rouillan and Georges  Cipriani, were charged with a series of murders and attacks between 1984 and  1986.
They were already serving a life term handed down in 1989 for the murder  of Georges Besse, the chairman of automaker Renault in 1986.
Their second trial began on May 2.
Another defendant in the second trial was acquitted after spending 21  months in jail.
