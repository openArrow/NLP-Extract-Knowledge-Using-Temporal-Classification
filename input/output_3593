Visiting Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav  Daskalov told Greece Tuesday Macedonian independence was in Bulgaria's  interest and also that of Balkan stability.
"Bulgaria backs the existence of a positive climate between all its  neighbour states," Daskalov said after a meeting with Greek counterpart  Carolos Papoulias. He advised Greece and its former Yugoslav neighbour to  settle their differences amicably.
Papoulias replied Athens wanted "the existence of the Skopje state" and  also the "normalisation" of relations with it, but only if the new state  "abandons its extreme positions." He added he would go to New York next month  to meet UN mediator on Macedonia Cyrus Vance.
Greece believes Macedonia has territorial designs on its own region of the  same name and wants the former Yugoslav republic to change its flag, which  bears ancient Greek symbols.
Both ministers expressed unease over UN military operations in  Bosnia-Hercegovina, but viewed Tuesday's Geneva meeting of parties involved in  the conflict as constituting "progress."
Papoulias also briefed Daskalov on the state of Greek-Albanian relations,  under strain recently due to the status of the Greek minority in Albania. He  said Tirana's respect for the minority's rights formed the "cornerstone" of  their relations.
The two men additionally discussed setting up a committee to deal with  shared natural resources and transport links.
