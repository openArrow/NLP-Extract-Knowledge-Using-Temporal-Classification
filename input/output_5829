New Zealand have put 24-year-old Otago seamer Aaron  Gale on alert for the first Test against England, starting at Nottingham on  Thusday.
Gale is spending the English summer playing in the Durham League, but  could be pencilled in for Trent Bridge if both Danny Morrison and Michael  Owens are ruled unfit.
The tourists received better news Tuesday on Chris Pringle -- an  orthopaedic surgeon reported only soft tissue damage and he could play again  within a fortnight.
It had been feared the experienced seamer, who broke down as he warmed up    for the drawn match against Essex last weekend, had ruptured a disc.
Gale's chances may have receded somewhat with Morrison, the Kiwis' only   world-class bowler, reporting a significant improvement on Tuesday to his  pulled hamstring.
Captain Ken Rutherford said: "In the end it comes down to numbers. Danny  might just have to play even though he's not fully fit because he's our one  proven Test wicket-taker."
Owens, called up when Simon Doull flew home injured two weeks ago, is  highly doubtful with a groin strain.
The Kiwis have just three fully fit seamers on call -- Dion Nash,  vice-captain Gavin Larsen and the erratic Heath Davis.
