Romero began the last round one shot behind overnight leader Fredrik  Lindgren, of Sweden, who finished third two shots further back.
The Arentinian romped to the front despite taking three putts for a par  five at the first. He birdied the short second, had an eagle three at the next  then followed wiht another birdie at the fourth, all from ten feet.
Turner, however, the brother of former New Zealand cricket captain Glenn,  was also producing blazing form, adding to six earlier birdies with one at the  16th and 17th.
The last one, made by a 40-foot putt, allowed Turner to draw level but the  South American made a ten-footer for birdie on the 15th and parred the final  three holes.
At the difficult 460-yard last he drove into rough and was 45 feet from  the flag in two. When his first putt rolled seven feet past Turner sensed the  chance of a play-off, but Romero slotted in the return to win.
Turner said: "I thought that a 66 might be good enough this time, but the  weather was so good that I had to change that. I had to wait about ten minutes  on the last tee and when you are on a roll, as I was, the last thing you want  is to stand around. But that's not an excuse."
