Defense Secretary William Perry will hold talks  early next week in Brussels with Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and  NATO leaders to work out options linking Russia's military to the West.
The 16-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization is searching for a way to  forge a "special partnership" with Russia to induce it to join the  "Partnership for Peace".
Perry departs Monday for a two-day session at NATO headquarters in  Brussels, Belgium.
Recognizing Russia's special status among former NATO enemies as a heavily  armed nuclear power, NATO will seek an agreement with Russia to create close  consultations on security matters.
Russia has a relationship with NATO states that others don't - such as the  possession of nuclear weapons, requiring closer ties to NATO, said a senior  Pentagon official Thursday speaking on the condition of anonymity.
The arrangement would be separate from the Partnership for Peace, created  last January to induce greater cooperation between NATO and former Warsaw Pact  nations.
Russia has resisted joining the Partnership for Peace due in part to  domestic pressure. Conservative groups have argued links with the West would  weaken Russian defenses.
Any special agreement would not give Russia a seat in private  decision-making councils or allow it to veto alliance decisions, US and NATO  officials said.
"Russia will not have any authority over the other peace partners," the  official said.
Grachev is scheduled to meet NATO ministers Tuesday and discuss Russia's  stance on cooperation.
He told reporters in Moscow Thursday that Russia would try to convince  NATO officials that it needs special conditions to participate in the  Partnership for Peace. He did not specify what the conditions are.
