Britain should forget China's Tiananmen Square  massacre and concentrate on business with a country that will become one of  the world's big powers, former prime minister Edward Heath said Tuesday.
"Let's stop talking about Tiananmen Square. ... These incidents happen,  and that was a bad one. ... But as far as the future is concerned, I believe  they are equally determined it should not happen again," he said, referring to  the  military crack-down on pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square,  Beijing, which took place almost exactly five years ago on June 4, 1989.
Britain was lagging behind others in trade with China, potentially one of  the world's most important and economically-powerful nations, said the former  Tory premier in a lecture at Glasgow University, Scotland, on the theme of  Europe and the wider world.
US President Bill Clinton, who last week announced he had ended the link  between Most-Favoured-Nation trading status for China and human rights, was  forced to drop the connection after protests from American businessmen, said  Heath.
And he added: "Try to persuade them, yes -- try to threaten them or tell  them, no."
The world's most important powers are set to be China, Japan, Russia, the  United States, the European Union, and possibly India, he said.
