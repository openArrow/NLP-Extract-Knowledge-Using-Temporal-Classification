Japanese authorities rescued seven Russian sailors   after their vessel capsized in the Sea of Okhotsk Monday, while a search  continued for an eighth crewmember, a Maritime Safety Agency official said.
The official said a Russian rescue vessel contacted the agency after  finding the 200-tonne SRP-119 listing in waters about 100 kilometres (62  miles) north of Mombetsu, and about the same distance southeast of the Soya  Strait.
The agency then rescued seven people from the timber carrier, and were  still searching for the eighth member, officials said.
