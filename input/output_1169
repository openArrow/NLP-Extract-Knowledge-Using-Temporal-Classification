A three-member team from the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) headed for North Korea on Tuesday after a Beijing  stopover, launching a crucial visit to monitor the controversial North Korean  nuclear programme.
The delegation, comprising Olli Heinonen of Finland, Vladimir Rukhlo, a  Russian, and Jamaluddin Omar, a Tanzanian, checked in for a scheduled flight  to Pyongyang aboard a North Korean airliner, an AFP reporter saw.
North Korea announced on Saturday that it was beginning to replace fuel  rods at the Yongbyon nuclear site, 90 kilometers (54 miles) north of  Pyongyang, without the presence of IAEA monitors.
The IAEA, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, has insisted on viewing  the operation, saying it is vital for vetting suspicions about North Korea's  nuclear programme. According to the United States, the procedure could release  enough plutonium for at least four nuclear bombs.
The inspectors, who took part in a previous IAEA mission to North Korea in  March, are scheduled to return to China next Tuesday.
However, the agency has said that if the reports of the refuelling turn  out to be correct, the inspectors will be immediately recalled to Vienna.
