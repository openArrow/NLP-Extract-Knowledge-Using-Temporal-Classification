Attorney Ellis Rubin said Saturday that  teenage tennis star Jennifer Capriati might be benefitting from a coverup  after her arrest for marijuana possession.
Rubin, known for taking on offbeat cases, is representing Nathan Wilson,  18, who attended a weekend drug party that ended in the arrest of Capriati and  two others on May 16.
Wilson was not in the motel room rented by 18-year-old Capriati when  police arrived and was not arrested.
But his lawyer said he called the press conference because the two others  arrested, 20-year-old transient Tom Wineland and 17-year-old runaway Timineet  Branagan, appeared to be taking all the blame for the incident.
Wineland was charged with possession of suspected crack cocaine and  Branagan with heroin possession.
Wilson said he had seen Capriati using heroin and crack and taking  depressants that heighten the effect of alcohol, but police say they have no  evidence she did.
Rubin said two factors indicated a possible coverup.
First, he said, a 16-year-old girl who introduced Wilson to Capriati is,  according to Wilson, the daughter of a woman who works for the US Drug  Enforcement Agency.
The girl's stepfather took her away from the drug party minutes before  police arrived, according to Wilson. Rubin said that apparent coincidence was  suspicious.
And Wilson's mother, Susan Wilson, said her son had received "one or two"  telephone threats of physical violence from people who were apparently trying  to protect Capriati's image.
Capritai's agent, International Management Group, had no immediate  response to Rubin's claims.
Rubin said he would call Florida prosecutors on Tuesday, after the  Memorial Day holiday, and offer to let his client talk to investigators.
He said Wilson is willing to take a lie-detector test.
Capriati, who has not played a professional tennis tournament since she  lost in the first round of the 1993 US Open, voluntarily entered a drug  rehabilitation program two days after her arrest.
