Israeli troops shot dead two wanted Moslem  fundamentalist suspects on the occupied West Bank just north of Jerusalem on  Tuesday, military officials said.
The officials said the two men were senior members of the Islamic  Resistance Movement HAMAS which is fighting on against Israel despite autonomy.
Palestinian witnesses said the two got off a bus in the A-Ram district and  were followed by a transit van bearing an Israeli flag.
Two Israeli undercover soldiers in civilian dress got out of the van,  hailed the Palestinians and opened fire in the street, they said.
The Israelis climbed back into the van where three colleagues waited and  drove off in the direction of a nearby army base, the witnesses said.
Uniformed Israeli troops arrived within minutes and carried off the two  corpses before ambulances arrived, the Palestinian witnesses said.
The troops cleaned the area before leaving.
The dead men were not known in the district, the witnesses said.
