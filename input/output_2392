The drachma came under strong selling pressure here  on Friday and fell to 152 to the mark from 149.9 at the close on Thursday.
The interbank interest rate rose to record high points.
"The pressure is very strong and the Bank of Greece now holds the key to  the situation," the chief dealer at Citibank in Greece, Yorgo Kondoyannis,  said.
He noted that the central bank had spent 150 million dollars in supporting  the currency on Thursday.
The interbank overnight rate rose to 250 percent. On Monday the central  bank had increased its overdraft rate to 182 percent per year to discourage  speculation.
Reports on Greek radio said that managers of the central bank were meeting  repeatedly and that Friday was a "crucial day" for the drachma.
