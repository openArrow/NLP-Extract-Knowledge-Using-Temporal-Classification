Two former Formula One drivers and a Le Mans  winner are being lined up to take part in China's first internationally  recognized motor race in November.
Olivier Grouillard, Oscar Larrauri and former Le Mans victor John Neilsen  will take part in the China-Zhuhai international race in Guangdong province on  November 13, chief organiser Qi Jin Cheng said here Saturday.
The International Automobile Federation (FIA) has given its stamp of  approval for the event -- another first for Chinese sport. The race will mark  a new step toward China's ambition of getting its own Formula One grand prix.
Qi, secretary general of the Federation of Automobile Sports of the  People's Republic of China (FASC), said: "This is a significant announcement  for motor sport in China and is the beginning of what I am sure will be the  recognition of Zhuhai as an important date in the international racing  calender."
The race through the streets of Zhuhai will be between Venturi, Ferrari,  Lotus and Porsche Grand Touring (GT) cars. A field of about 30 cars from  Europe, the United States and Japan is expected.
Each car will have a two man team who will share duties for the 75 lap  endurance race.
With the help of the Hong Kong Automobile Association, Zhuhai staged a  first race meeting in March 1993 which drew more than 100,000 spectators.
An international standard racing circuit is expected to be finished in  1996, 20 minutes from the town and China is already lobbying hard to stage its  first Formula One grand prix before the end of the decade.
