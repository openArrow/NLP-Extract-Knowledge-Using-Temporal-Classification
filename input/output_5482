Britain's Chris Boardman took full  advantage of typically British weather conditions to win the Criterium du  Dauphine Libere prologue here on Monday.
The former Olympic pursuit champion and one-hour world record holder, in  his first professional season, braved the rain to clock 8min 50.05secs over  the 6.7km course, beating GAN teammate Jean-Philippe Dojwa of France (8:51.18)  and another Frenchman, Emmanuel Magnien (8:52.68).
It was the 25-year-old Boardman's third success in time trials this season  after his wins in the Tour of Murcia in Spain in March.
He said: "I had two objectives here -- the prologue and the time trial.
"It was very British weather but without the cold. Next come the  mountains, which are not my speciality but if I'm in good form, who know?"
