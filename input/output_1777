Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi survived a  confidence motion Wednesday in the Senate by a single vote, Senate speaker  Carlo Scognamiglio announced.
Of 314 senators casting votes in the 326-seat chamber, 159 were in favor,  153 against and two abstained. An absolute majority was 158.
Controversy leading up to the vote had centered on the presence of five  neo-fasciststs in Berlusconi's 25-member cabinet, with centrists calling on  him to dump them in exchange for their support in the confidence vote.
Berlusconi led a rightwing coalition that swept to victory in elections in  late March that confirmed the demise of corruption-tainted traditional parties  like the Christian Democrats and Socialists.
