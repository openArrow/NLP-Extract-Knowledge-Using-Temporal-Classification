Arsenal's Danish international John Jensen and  England striker Ian Wright are to receive European Cup Winners Cup medals,  even though they both missed the 1-0 final victory over Parma in Copenhagen.
Wright, suspended after being booked in the semi-final, and Jensen,  injured playing for Denmark, had originally been told by UEFA that they were  not eligible.
But Jensen said on Friday: "We have been told by Arsenal that we will now  get a medal.
"I'm absolutely delighted because it'll be a treasured memento for life."
