India's main communist party is seeking  donations to ship 200 tonnes of detergent and 140 tonnes of soap to Cuba to  help alleviate shortages there, a Marxist leader said on Wednesday.
The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has asked supporters for 300,000  rupees (10,000 dollars) to meet the cost of transporting the goods to  Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, from where they would be shipped to Havana.
"We are expressing solidarity," said Harkishan Singh Surjeet, general  secretary of the CPI (M), who heads a Cuba solidarity group which shipped  10,000 tonnes of wheat and medicines to Cuba in 1992.
