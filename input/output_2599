Share prices on Wall Street rose sharply for the  week on a long-expected hike in long-term interest rates.
The Dow Jones index of 30 blue chips closed Friday at 3,766.35, up 106.67  points (2.9 percent) from the preceding week.
The New York exchange rose seven days in a row since May 12, even rising  on Friday despite nervousness on the monthly expiration of stock options.
The Federal Reserve's decision to raise the rate that banks charge each  other and in the discount rate by 0.5 percent -- bringing them up to 4.25  percent and 3.5 percent respectively -- was largely anticipated but well  received on the US financial markets.
"The market responded positively, but the Fed action didn't cure all the  wounds," said Dennis Jarrett of Kidder Peabody. "The euphoria will wind down  next week."
Jarrett said that investors would soon turn their attention to the economy  with the first revision of the gross domestic product and corporate  performances.
The Dow is expected to slide to 3,400 by mid-year but, added Jarrett,  "(it's) too early to say if we are in a bear market."
Michael Metz, a trader with Oppenheimer, was more pessimistic. He called  the Dow's rise was nothing more than "a bounce in a bear market" and predicted  that it would fall to 3,100 by mid-year.
And long-term interest rates are expected to rise to 7.60 percent, but the  bond market is not expected to be a driving force on Wall Street, said Jarrett.
A rise in the prices of primary products, especially precious metals,  could feed inflationary fears and push long-term interest rates up to eight  percent by the end of the year, said Metz.
On the bond market, interest rates on 30-year Treasury bonds fell to 7.3  percent down from 7.49 percent last week.
Many investors who had been holding back until the Federal Reserve acted  returned to the market as buyers, said Metz. But the rise in short-term  interest rates still offered an "attractive alternative" to stock buys, he  added.
