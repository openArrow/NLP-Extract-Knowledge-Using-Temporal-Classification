Some 1,000 victims of the Gulf war will share in  the first compensation payments of about three million dollars to be made  within two weeks, it was announced here Thursday.
Carlos Alzamorra, secretary of the UN-sponsored compensation commission,  said the first to receive payments, averaging 2,500 to 3,000 dollars per  person, were among those injured or having lost relatives during the course of  Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
The money, from Iraqi funds frozen abroad, will be paid out mostly to  citizens of Kuwait, Jordan, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Britain, the United States  and France.
Another 4,000 people, among the priority cases, are expected to receive  compensation payments by the end of the year.
The cases of some 50,000 people claiming compensation because of being  forced out of Kuwait or Iraq during the conflict will be examined in September.
The commission has received some 450,000 claims for material losses of  less than 100,000 dollars which will also be examined as of September.
The commission however only has some 150 million dollars to deal with the  main body of claims.
