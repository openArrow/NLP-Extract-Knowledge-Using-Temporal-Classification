A minority stake in the Spanish Endesa electricity  productioin company offered for privatisation has been 325 percent  oversubscribed, the state-owned Teneo group said on Friday.
Teneo, which groups potentially profitable companies within the state INI  holding company and which holds 75.58 percent on Endesa, said that offers had  been made for nearly 20 million shares when the offer closed on Thursday night.
The amount earmarked for sale to private investors had been set at  6,084,000 shares.
The stake for privatisation had been increased on May 20 from 8.26 percent  to 8.70 percent.
Allocations would be made on a pro-rata basis to ensure that small  shareholders obtained a holding, Teneo said.
INI has said that 10 percent of Endesa would be sold during the first half  of the year.
In 1993 Endesa made a net profit of 117 billion pesetas (847 million  dollars) from 106.3 billion pesetas in 1992. This enabled Teneo to avoid  reporting a loss last year. In 1993 it reported a net profit of three billion  pesetas compared with a profit of 21 billion pesetas in 1992.
It is the biggest Spanish company in terms of capitalisation and it  produces more than half of all Spanish electricity.
