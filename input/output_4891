Oscar De la Hoya kept his World Boxing  Organisation junior lightweight title when he stopped Italian Giorgio  Campanella in three spectacular rounds here Friday.
The only United States gold medal winner from the 1992 Barcelona Olympics  was knocked down by a left hook in the first 15 seconds but knocked his  Italian challenger down in the second.
Campanella, fighting in the US for the first time, crumpled under a  barrage of punches in the third round and was struggling to his feet when his  corner threw the towel in.
De La Hoya stretched his winning streak to 13 fights
Rafael Ruelas retained his International Boxing Federation lightweight  title when he stopped fellow American Mike Evgen in three rounds in a fight on  the same bill.
Ruelas, defending for the first time, scored his 41st win when the referee  intervened. He has been beaten once.
Evgen, the eighth-ranked challenger, has now lost three times and won 25.
Roy Jones kept his IBF middleweight crown by stopping Thomas Tate in the  second round in another all-American fight.
The unbeaten Jones was defending his title, won a year ago, for the first  time. It was his 26th win.
Tate, the number one challenger, lost for the third time against 29 wins.
