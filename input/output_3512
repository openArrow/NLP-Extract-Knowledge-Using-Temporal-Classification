Japan's sixth-seed Kimiko Date, who has never found  Paris a happy hunting ground, crashed at the first hurdle of the women's  singles at the French Open here on Tuesday when she was beaten in  straight-sets by Amanda Coetzer.
Date, who went out in the second round last year, was never allowed to  settle under the overcast skies by the aggressive 18th-ranked South African,  and she went down 2-6, 1-6.
She is the third women's seed who has failed to survive the first round.  On Monday fourth-seeded Martina Navratilova and the number thirteen, Magdalena  Maleeva of Bulgaria, were also frogmarched out of the event without winning a  set.
Coetzer, who has been enjoying an excellent start to the season, now faces  either Australia's Rachel McQuillan or Radka Bobova of the Czech Repulic. She  could well be heading for a fourth round clash against twelfth-seeded Mary  Pierce of France.
So far this season Coetzer has been a runner-up to Steffi Graf at Indian  Wells and a winner at Prague where she defeated Sweden's Asa Carlsson 6-1, 7-6.
It was a bitter disappointment for the 23-year-old Date who has posted  tournament wins at both Sydney and Tokyo and who reached the semi-finals at  the Australian Open.
