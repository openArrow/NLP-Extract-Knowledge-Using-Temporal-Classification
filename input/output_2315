Britain and China failed yet again Friday to  agree on the financing of Hong Kong's mammoth new airport, although both sides  claimed they were making some headway.
"The fact is, there are still questions in the Chinese minds," the chief  British negotiator, Hugh Davies, told reporters after the first meeting of the  Joint Liaison Group airport committee in nine months.
"We're disappointed. We would like to have seen more progress," he said.  "But on the whole, we found the atmosphere positive, and I think we're on the  right track."
His Chinese counterpart, Guo Fengmin, was somewhat more upbeat, saying the  two sides had made "positive progress" and even found common ground on some  issues, which he did specify.
"But we still have work to do," Guo said, indicating a decision was not  yet in sight on how to pay for the 20.3 billion US dollar Chek Lap Kok airport  and related public works.
The new airport, off the outlying island of Lantau, is due to replace  congested inner-city Kai Tak airport in 1997, when Hong Kong reverts to China,  and is one of the biggest public works projects in the world today.
But although site preparation work is well under way, Britain and China  have long been at loggerheads over the amount of debt that should be raised to  pay for the vast undertaking.
The issue has also been overshadowed by China's shrill attacks on Governor  Chris Patten's attempts to extend democracy in Hong Kong, although Beijing has  suggested in recent weeks that it might separate the two issues.
Davies said Britain's fourth and latest financing proposal -- which calls  for 60 billion Hong Kong dollars (7.76 billion US) to be injected as equity  from Hong Kong's bulging reserves -- was still very much alive.
"There are still various quesions within the overall financing package  that need to be resolved," he said, adding that agreement could happen  "rapidly" if the Chinese side accepted Britain's terms.
More talks are to be held at the expert level, but no date was set for  another meeting of the airport committee, Davies said.
He also said the airport issue was unlikely to come up at the next full  meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, the diplomatic body charged  with hammering out the technical details of Hong Kong's change of sovereignty.
