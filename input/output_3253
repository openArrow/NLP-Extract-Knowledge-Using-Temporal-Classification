South Africa was formerly accepted as the 53rd  member of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) Monday after attaining the  support of a majority of member states, the OAU announced.
"To commemorate the admission of the Republic of South Africa as the 53rd  member state of the organization, a special flag-raising ceremony shall take  place on May 25 at the OAU headquarters," the office of OAU Secretary General  Salim Ahmed Salim said in a statement.
The OAU headquarters is in Addis Ababa.
South Africa's newly appointed Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo will fly to  Ethiopia Wednesday for the flag-raising ceremeony to be held on the  international body's 31st anniversary.
The announcement came after a South African government official said  Nelson Mandela would make his first overseas trip as South African president  to Tunis next month for a OAU summit.
Foreign ministry director general Rusty Evans told reporters Mandela would  attend the OAU summit from June 13 to 15.
It will be preceded by an OAU ministerial meeting on June 6-12 at which  South Africa will be represented by Nzo.
Evans said Mandela's first deputy president, Thabo Mbeki, would also be in  Addis Ababa Wednesday to attend the ceremony at which the new South African  flag is to be officially hoisted at OAU headquarters.
Evans said South Africa's return to the Commonwealth was "a foregone  conclusion" and that discussions were under way for the resumption of the  country's full membership at the United Nations.
One potential sticking point, he said, was the payment of South Africa's  arrears of more than 100 million dollars to the world body in dues unpaid  since the U.N. Credentials Committee rejected Pretoria's credentials in 1974.
But ministry officials said they believed the matter would be cleared up  by the next U.N. General Assembly session scheduled for September.
