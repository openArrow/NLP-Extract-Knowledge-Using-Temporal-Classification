Provisional President Emile Jonassaint  barred former prime minister Robert Malval and members of his government  Tuesday from leaving Haiti.
State-run television announced the order barring the exit of any former  officials who had managed government finances under Malval or ousted president  Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Jonassaint, who is not recognized internationally, was inaugurated earlier  this month by the military which ousted Aristide in a September 1991 coup.
Observers here warned that the order is likely to escalate tensions  between Jonassaint's officials and Malval's government which continues despite  the switch to manage some government business in anticipation of the  appointment of a new prime minister by Aristide.
The Governors Island Agreement signed by Aristide and the military in July  1993 calls for the ousted president to name an interim prime minister as a  step toward reestablishing democracy in the Caribbean nation.
Malval was initially named but stepped down in December citing the lack of  progress on the accord.
The televised statement said the measure was made out of "legitimate  concerns" for the public interest and that officials at border posts had been  notified to carry out the order.
