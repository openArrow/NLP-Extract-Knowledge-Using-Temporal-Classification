African National Congress (ANC) secretary  general Cyril Ramaphosa was Sunday set to become chairman of South Africa's  Constituent Assembly after winning his party's nomination for the post, ANC  sources said.
The Constituent Assembly, comprising the 90-member Senate and the  400-member National Assembly, is due to meet for the first time Tuesday to  elect a chairman.
As the ANC holds majorities in both houses, Ramaphosa is certain to be  appointed to the powerful position, which is equivalent in status to a cabinet  posting.
His unanimous election at a special session of the ANC's parliamentary  caucus here Sunday effectively charges Ramaphosa with overseeing the process  that will give South Africa's new constitution its final shape over the next  five years.
Ramaphosa, who turned down a cabinet posting in President Nelson Mandela's  government of national unity in order, he said, to strengthen the ANC, was the  party's chief negotiator at the multiparty negotiations that drew up South  Africa's interim constitution.
The Constituent Assembly meeting will be held before Mandela opens the  lower house's working session with a state of the country address Tuesday  afternoon, to be followed by a four-day debate.
The assembly will then recess until June 20, when it will reconvene to  pass the national budget by July 10, then recess again to reopen in August.
