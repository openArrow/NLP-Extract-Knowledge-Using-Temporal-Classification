Rwandan rebels said Friday they now controlled  more than half of the country and urged government forces to desert and join  them.
Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF), in a radio broadcast monitored by the BBC,  said that areas under its control included the northern district of Byumba,  Kibungo in the east, and a large part of the southern prefecture of Gitarama.
Also under rebel control were the central region of the capital, Kigali,  which constitutes more tham half the city, the radio said.
"Peace has been restored to the areas controlled by the RPF and refugees  who had fled to countries neighbouring Rwanda are streaming back home daily,"  the rebel radio claimed.
It said the RPF chairman Alexis Kanyarengwe had called upon  government-supporting militia in the RPF-controlled areas to hand in their  weapons to the movement's authorities.
RPF military leader, Major-General Paul Kagame urged members of the  government forces to join his fighters.
Some senior officers in the government forces had already switched sides,  the radio added.
The mainly Tutsi RPF fighters have kept up their push against battle-weary  government soldiers who have reportedly started fleeing Kigali.
The death of president Juvenal Habyarimana in an alleged April 6 rocket  attack on his plane unleashed a tide of tribal bloodletting in which 200,000  to half a million Rwandans have been killed.
Many of the victims came from the Tutsi minority or were moderate members  of the majority Hutu tribe, slain by extremist Hutu militias.
