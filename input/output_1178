Avi Mar Yosef, secretary at Haggai, said: "The attack took place just 100  metres south of the settlement."
The casualties were taken to a Jerusalem hospital by helicopter, he told  Israel state radio.
The army closed off the area and began a manhunt.
Seventeen Palestinians were wounded in clashes with Israeli settlers and  troops on Monday in Hebron, which has remained a flashpoint since the February   25 massacre of 30 Moslems by a Jewish gunman.
