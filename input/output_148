Ireland's rugby union side see their  eight-match Australian tour as a major stepping stone to next year's World Cup  in South Africa, skipper Michael Bradley said here Friday.
"The squad of 30, including 12 uncapped players, will develop and learn  during their three weeks here," the 31-year old scrum-half from Cork said  after players arrived here ahead of Ireland's first visit to Australia in 15  years.
The programme begins Wednesday with a night match against Western  Australia at one of the world's best known cricket grounds, the WACA (Western  Australian Cricket Association) Ground.
Bradley, who made his international debut against Australia a decade ago,  conceded that the squad's relative inexperience would make it a tough tour.  Especially the two Tests in Brisbane and Sydney against reigning world  champions Australia.
"There are a lot of players the Australian public have not seen, and these  guys are looking forward to expressing themselves on the pitch," he said.
"This side are willing to learn and they learn fast," he said. "It depends  on how games go, but I believe that by the end of the tour we will be a much  better side. It's all part of our World Cup preparations."
The Irish are in a buoyant frame of mind after beating England and drawing  with Scotland in the recent Five Nations championship.
Coach Gerry Murphy said extensive changes to the team meant that only four  players from the side which almost defeated Australia in a 1991 World Cup  quarter-final, now remained. They are full-back Jim Staples, wingman Simon  Geoghehan, flanker Brian Robinson and lock Neil Francis.
It is the first time Ireland have toured Australia since 1979 when they  won the Test series 2-0.
Western Australia, traditional easybeats of the Australian circuit, were  thrashed 39-10 by Natal three weeks ago.
But an optimistic coach Tom Browne said Friday:"We hope this time we may  be able to reverse the usual result."
