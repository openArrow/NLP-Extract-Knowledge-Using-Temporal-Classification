Thai police who raided a sweatshop in a Bangkok  suburb found 32 women and girls held prisoner, some of whom said they had been  locked away for four years, an investigative officer said Tuesday.
Nine Thai and 23 ethnic Karen girls, ranging in age from 14 to 35, told  police they had been made to work 16 hours a day sewing jeans in the remote  district of Chom Thong for no pay, the officer said.
The women and girls were found Monday.
Their mail had been screened while they were kept behind steel doors and  thick window bars, and they were dependent on their two elderly work  supervisors for meals, he said.
Police were alerted by one worker, an 18-year-old Thai who managed to  squeeze through the window bars of the four-storey factor and shimmy down a  drain pipe, he said.
Shop workers told police they had been promised 500 baht (20 dollars) a  month to make clothing, but found after their arrival that they would receive  no pay.
Some told police they had been held captive for as long as four years and  had been allowed outside only when the factory's location was changed to avoid  detection.
Police arrested the two Thais who supervised the shop, the officer said.  They have been charged with illegal detention of workers, hiring child labor,  and importing and sheltering illegal aliens.
The pair face a maximum combined sentence of eight years and a 20,000 baht  (800 dollars) fine for each count.
Most of the girls were being sheltered at the Thai government's Public  Welfare department while others had returned home, the officer said.
