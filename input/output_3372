Even before Asprilla arrived in Italy, the media alleged his Colombian  side, Nacional, had only given the thumbs up for his 4.5m dollar move after  consultation with legendary drugs baron Pablo Escobar.
Nacionale denied Escobar had an influence at the club, but the damage had  already been done.
However Asprilla's skill quickly impressed Parma coach Nevio Scala, who  often left out Brazilian goalkeeper Taffarel, and kept Asprilla with Sweden's  Thomas Brolin and Belgian George Grun as the three-foreigner contingent.
Asprilla ensured his fame when he scored the solitary goal of the match  which ended AC Milan's 58-match, 21-month unbeaten league run in March last  year.
However, it was just about at that time that Parma management had their  ,biggest, and most mysterious, off-field problem with Asprilla.
Asprilla had gone back to Colombia for the Easter, but when he came back,  a gashed leg ruled him out of the European Cup Winners' Cup final last year,  when Parma beat Royal Antwerp 3-1.
Asprilla said he had cut his leg on a bottle beside a swimming pool,  however Colombian media claimed he kicked in the window of a bus on a rowdy  night out.
Yet Asprilla went on to further fame with Colombia, when he scored twice  in their 5-0 thrashing of Argentina which booked their World Cup place, and  inflicted one of Argentina's worst losses this century.
