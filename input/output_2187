The dollar rose against most major currencies  Thursday as traders were encouraged by the resumption of US-Japan talks aimed  at cutting the 60 billion dollar US deficit with Japan.
Gold fell 60 cents from Wednesday's closing price to 381.40 dollars an  ounce.
Around 4:45 p.m. (2045 GMT), the dollar was trading at 1.6575 German marks  against 1.6570 Wednesday and at 104.30 yen from 103.45.
The US currency also rose to 1.4130 Swiss francs from 1.4085 and 0.6633  pounds sterling from 0.6629, but fell to 5.6660 French francs against 5.6710.
The opening of talks on resuming trade negotiations between the United  States and Japan cheered the foreign exchange markets, a dealer with a major  European bank in New York said.
"They believe that the Japanese are committed to do something this time  even though it probably won't be much," the trader said.
The trade talks collapsed in February over a dispute over how to measure  progress in opening Japan's markets and reducing its multi-billion dollar  trade surplus with the United States.
Figures released Thursday showed that the entire US trade deficit shrank  18.5 percent to 7.46 billion dollars in March.
Despite the general improvement, the United States' goods deficit with  Japan soared by 25.4 percent to 5.8 billion dollars, the third-highest record  level, the Commerce Department said.
