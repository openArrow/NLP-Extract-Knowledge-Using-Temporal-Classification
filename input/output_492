Germany's Michael Schumacher will start from the  front in Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix, although the race remains overshadowed by  the crash involving Karl Wendlinger.
The Austrian is in a deep coma after Thursday's smash, the latest  nightmare faced by Formula One after the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland  Ratzenberger at the San Marino Grand Prix two weeks ago.
Out of respect for Senna and Ratzenberger, the drivers were set to leave  the front row clear on Sunday, starting a line further back.
Schumacher, who has won all three races this season, stamped his authority  on Saturday's final official practice in the Benetton-Ford.
The German was nearly a second faster than Finland's Mika Hakkinen, at the  wheel of the McLaren-Peugeot, as they went through their paces on this  legendary street circuit.
Gerhard Berger, who has done much to mobilise drivers over safety in the  last fortnight, and will be a leading figure in the newly-formed Grand Prix  Drivers Association, set the third best time in a Ferrari.
The late Senna's teammate at Williams-Renault, Damon Hill, will start on  the second row of cars alongside Berger, whose French teammate Jean Alesi will  start on the third with Brazil's Christian Fittipaldi in the Footwork Ford.
Hugely talented and driving the best car in the championship, Schumacher  now has no serious rival for the crown in the wake of Senna's death.
McLaren-Peugeot and Ferrari are also likely to win races this season, as  could Hill but there is little doubt that Benetton-Ford will get the top prize.
