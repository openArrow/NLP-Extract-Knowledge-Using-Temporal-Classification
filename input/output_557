Rain delayed the start of qualifying for 75 minutes after 25 cars set  their top practice speeds in a rain-shortened warmup session.
Penske racer Paul Tracy, injured in a practice crash Friday, was released  from Methodist Hospital here Saturday but not cleared to drive by speedway  officials. Penske team officials said Tracy would not comment until he is  declared fit for qualifying.
"He's disappointed, but the goal is to get one car on the pole," Penske  said. "I'm just glad he can run whenever we get to qualify again."
