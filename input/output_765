The French domestic airline Air Inter said Sunday  that it was cancelling all flights Tuesday except those to Corsica due to a  strike by employees.
The company said in a statement that it would schedule extra flights  Monday and Wednesday to make up for the cancellations.
The unions called the strike to protest European Union regulations  requiring France to open its lucrative routes from Paris' Orly airport to  Marseilles and Toulouse in southern France to other companies.
Air Inter is 72.3 percent owned by the loss-making state airline Air  France.
The European Commission also ordered France to open the Orly-Heathrow  route to non-French firms on Monday, but French officials refused, saying they  needed more time to deal with overcrowding and environmental problems at the  airport south of Paris.
French and British authorities finally reached agreement Sunday that Orly  would open to flights from London by the end of June.
