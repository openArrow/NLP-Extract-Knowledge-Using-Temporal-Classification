American Pete Sampras, warming up for the French  Open, gave his rivals an early fright by crushing Boris Becker in the Italian  Open final here on Sunday.
The world number one continued his extraordinary run of success by  thrashing the German in straight sets, winnning 6-1, 6-2, 6-2, at the Foro  Italico.
The victory also proved he has at last come to terms with clay courts --  just in time for the start of the Grand Slam event at Roland Garros in eight  days time.
Sampras, who has won the last three Grand Slams at Wimbledon, the US and  the Australian Open, said: "I feel confident going into the French Open, I  feel good about my tennis.
"I don't know if I can win it this year, but in a year, five years or ten,  I'd love to take that title."
It was his second clay-court success of his career after winning at  Kitzbuhel, Austria, in 1992. More importantly, however, it was his seventh  title this season and the fifth in a row in only nine outings, picking up 1.5  million dollars on the way.
He was last beaten by Jacco Eltingh of the Netherlands in the first round  at Philadelphia in February, since when he has won 27 matches in a row.
Becker's defeat deprived him of his first career success on the surface.
Ranked 13th in the world, he never got into the match, taking over  half-an-hour to take his first game before Sampras won the first set in 35  minutes.
The American 22-year-old broke Becker immediately in the next to continue  the trend, playing patiently from the baseline until he clinched the event  with his second match point.
Becker refused to be downhearted, however, saying: "When I came here this  week I never thought that I had a chance to reach the final. This has been one  of my best weeks on clay."
