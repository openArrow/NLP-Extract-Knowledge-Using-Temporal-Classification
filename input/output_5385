The Canadian 3rd divison attacked Juno on D-Day, the  middle of three beaches lying east of Arromanches.
Their goal was to take the RN 13 road linking Bayeux and Caen, to join up  with troops securing Gold and Omaha beaches, both to the west, and to take  Carpiquet airport.
The seventh brigade of the Canadians fought hand-to-hand in the town of  Bernieres with Nazi troops. The town fell in the morning.
But the 736th regiment of German grenadiers regrouped, blocking the way to  Caen, several kilometres (miles) inland. The radar site at Basly-Douvres, in  this sector, held out until June 17, eleven days after the D-Day landing June  6.
The Canadians were also unable to link up with British troops at the  eastern Sword beach and failed to get to RN 13 or to Carpiquet.
The Hitler youth of the 12th SS Panzer division, led by Kurt Meyer,  counter-attacked and fought ferociously before losing -- outnumbered,  outgunned and outsupplied.
On June 6 meanwhile, an artificial port was created by sinking 12 ships  off Courseulles, the town on Juno beach. It was here that on June 14, General  de Gaulle landed to set up the first provisional government of liberated  France in Bayeux, about 20 kilometres (12 miles) southwest of Courseulles.
