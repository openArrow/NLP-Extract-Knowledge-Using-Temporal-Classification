One of France's best-loved actors, Alain Cuny, known  for his interpretations of Paul Claudel and Shakespeare, died in hospital  early Tuesday at the age of 85, a hospital spokesman said.
A friend of the surrealists, and of the writer Antonin Artaud in  particular, the former painter was also linked to Jean Vilar with whom he  acted in the early Avignon Festivals.
Born in Saint-Malo, Brittany, Cuny acted in films directed by some of the  leading filmmakers of his generation -- Bunuel, Fellini (for whom he took part  in La Dolce Vita) and Louis Malle (Les Amants).
More recently, he took part in "Camille Claudel," the film about Rodin's  fellow sculptor and lover.
In 1990, he directed his first film but in more recent years he took to  giving readings of works by Freud, Proust, Lautreamont, Derrida, Foucault, and  the poet Louis-Rene des Forets.
