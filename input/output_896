The French airline Air Liberty is to complain to the  commission of the European union to obtain equal treatment for all airlines at  London Heathrow and Paris Orly airports, the company said on Monday.
The company said that it planned to open four daily flights between Orly  and Heathrow from June 30.
The commission has instructed France to make Orly airport accessible to  British Airways and its French subsidiary TAT in a move which has caused  anxiety to the French state-owned Air France airline which is in severe  financial trouble.
International flights for foreign airlines are currently operated from  Charles de Gaulle airport north of Paris, and the French authorities fear that  access for foreign airlines to Orly, south of Paris, will increase competition  on flights to the south of France.
During the weekend French and British authorities reached a compromise.  Orly is to be opened to British Airways from the end of June and French  airlins are to have greater access to Heathrow.
