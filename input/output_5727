German troops will march down Paris'  Champs-Elysees for the July 14 Bastille Day military parade, the first time  German soldiers will parade along the avenue since their wartime occupation of  France.
President Francois Mitterrand, winding up a Franco-German summit in this  eastern city, told reporters that German troops in the Eurocorps battalion  would be invited for the annual military parade.
"I have decided to invite for July 14, the European corps and therefore  German, Belgian, Luxemburg, and Spanish officials who are participants ot  about to become participants," Mitterrand said.
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, attending the 63rd Francp-German summit  with Mitterrand, replied: "It is a generous gesture we will respond warmly to,  and we hope our compatriots will find in it inspiration for the Europe of  tomorrow."
A highlight of the first day of talks on Monday came when Kohl gave  Mitterrand a painting by French impressionist Claude Monet taken by Nazi  troops during World War II and asked that it be returned to its former owners.
The summit is aimed at coordinating the French and German stand on  European issues. Bonn takes over the six-month rotating European Union (EU)  presidency from Greece in July, with France next in line for next winter.
