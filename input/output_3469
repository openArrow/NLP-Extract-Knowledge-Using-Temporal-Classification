Thousands of terrified Rwandans are scrambling out  of Kigali before the expected rebel takeover of the capital which they fear  will usher in reprisals for the massacres of Tutsis, relief officials said  Tuesday.
A special United Nations envoy was meanwhile expected to fly into Kigali  from the Ugandan capital Kampala on Tuesday after a dispute with the mainly  Tutsi rebels about the planned deployment of 5,500 peacekeepers to staunch  ethnic bloodletting in which up to half a million people have been butchered.
The envoy, Iqbal Riza, postponed his trip to Kigali on Monday because he  said neither rebels nor government forces could guarantee his security.
The army has since promised not to shoot down Riza's plane, and rebels who  captured Kigali airport Sunday have also pledged to hold their fire, UN  spokesman Abdul Kabia said.
The UN has asked the army and rebels to extend a shaky two-day truce that  began Monday when Riza arrived in northern Rwanda until Wednesday at six p.m.  (1600 GMT). Both sides were to respond later Tuesday, Kabia said.
Riza held "inconclusive" discussions about the return of UN troops to  Rwanda with leaders of the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) in their  northern stronghold of Mulindi on Monday, Kabia said.
"There was a disagreement over the size of the force," he said.
The rebels want a maximum of 2,500 UN troops because they fear that 5,500  soldiers could intervene in fighting between the RPF and the army though  intervention is not part of its essentially humanitarian mandate, Kabia said.
Relief officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said thousands of  people were streaming out of Kigali in a desperate scramble for safety before  the rebels seize control of the capital. UN military officials expect the  rebels to take over "within a week."
