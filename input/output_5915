Seve Ballesteros will be playing in  next month's US Open after all. The USGA decided Tuesday to give the Spanish  star a special exemption.
American Ben Crenshaw was also given a special exemption by the United  States Golf Association.
Earlier this week Ballesteros, winner of three Opens and two Masters, had  vowed to skip the US open if he was not given an automatic place.
Ballesteros had hoped to avoid having to qualify for Oakmont by staying in  the top two of Europe's Order of Merit but his eighth place finish in the PGA  Championship at the weekend sent him down to fourth in the table.
Ballesteros said: "If they don't invite me I will not not play. I have won  the Benson and Hedges International this month and my record speaks for itself.
"It's not a matter of pride. I just feel I deserve an invitation. I have  been 20 years on tour and I have proved myself. I don't think I have to prove  anything," fumed the Spaniard.
The USGA agreed with the outspoken Ballesteros.
"Both Seve Ballesteros and Ben Crenshaw have played well recently," said  USGA executive committee vice president Judy Bell, announcing the exemptions.
"They are world class players who have had exceptional performances  recently. They are great players who will be a great addition to the  championship field," she added.
