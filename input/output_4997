There were few easy ways to reach the fourth-round  of the men's singles at the French Open here on Saturday.
Goran Ivanisevic, South Americans Jaime Yzaga and Javier Frana, Sweden's  Magnus Larsson and Hendrik Dreekman of Germany all needed to survive gruelling  five-set matches to prolong their stay in Paris by another week.
Things were more straightforward for Spain's Alberto Berasategui and  Andrea Gaudenzi of Italy.
Michael Chang, who at 17yrs 3months was the youngest-ever winner of the  men's title back in 1989, just failed to recover from a two-set deficit  against Peru's 26-year-old Yzaga. And in a thrilling climax to a gruelling  marathon he had to surrender 2-6, 3-6, 7-5, 6-1, 5-7 after nearly  four-and-a-half hours.
Yzaga now plays Larsson for a quarter-final berth -- the Swede upsetting  another seed, number-nine Todd Martin 6-7 (5/7), 6-3, 6-0, 1-6, 6-3.
Fifth-seeded Goran Ivanisevic slammed down a score of aces and nearly as  many double-faults in a three-hour battle on the centre-court with  up-and-coming Spaniard Alex Corretja.
After several outbursts and racket-throwing, the volatile Croatian finally  clinched a dramatic 6-7 (3/7), 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-3 victory.
Australia's last singles survivor Mark Woodforde, who had been playing so  well since the tournament began, found himself playing catch-up tennis against  Javier Frana of Argentina. He never made it -- but he came very close.
The South American, who only returned to the tour in March after a  three-month absence for hepititis, remained unflinching in the crisis and the  28-year-old Australian bowed out with honours 4-6, 6-3, 0-6, 6-4, 8-10.
