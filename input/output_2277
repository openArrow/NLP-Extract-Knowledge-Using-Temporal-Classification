Visitors to the canopied apartment building on Fifth Avenue included her  sister, Lee Radziwill Ross, and their half-brother Jamie Auchincloss.
Congressman Kennedy, son of the late Robert Kennedy, arrived with flowers  and candy. Onassis' niece Maria Shriver also visited.
An intensely private woman, Onassis shunned the spotlight since her  husband's assassination in Dallas in 1963 and her stormy second marriage to  Aristotle Onassis, a Greek shipping tycoon.
The most famous image of her is also the most painful: the young wife  leaning over her husband's slumped body seconds after an assassin's bullet  struck their open limousine in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963.
Long the prey of paparazzis and tabloids, who dubbed her "Jackie O,"  Onassis had fought fiercely over the years to protect her family's privacy and  to raise her children to be as normal as possible.
But, out of the limelight, she has made a career as a book editor, first  at Viking Press and then Doubleday, handling a dozen books a year of  non-fiction subjects such as ballet and the performing arts.
