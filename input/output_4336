Russian President Boris Yeltsin is expected to sign  a partnership deal with the European Union at the EU summit meeting on the  Greek island of Corfu next month, Greek officials said Thursday.
Greek European Affairs Minister Theodore Pangalos told AFP the conditions  seemed right for the deal to be signed at the summit.
"We would be very happy to have President Yeltsin come," he said.
There has been no official Russian confirmation that Yeltsin will attend  the Corfu meeting.
Greece, which is organising the June 24-25 summit in its capacity as  current EU president, has already scheduled a ceremony for signing the  Russia-EU pact on the morning of Friday June 24, just before the summit's  official opening.
The Russia-EU agreement, under discussion for over a year, aims to remove  trade barriers between Russia and European Union.
In Moscow, the presidential press service declined to comment on whether  Yeltsin would attend the summit, saying hie programme for June had not been  finalized.
The most serious sticking point to a trade accord has been French  objections to cheap Russian exports of nuclear materials, undercutting French  sales.
But this appeared to have been removed last week during the visit of  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe to Moscow.
Juppe said the agreement was "practically finalised" and hoped it could be  finally agreed at a meeting of EU foreign ministers June 12-13.
