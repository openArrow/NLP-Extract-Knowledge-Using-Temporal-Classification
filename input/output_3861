Poland is ready to buy 20 percent of debts  totalling 13.2 billion dollars which it owes to commercial banks in the Club  of London, the chief Polish negotiator Krzysztof Krowacki said on Wednesday.
Poland made an offer to the working group of the Club of London on  Saturday to buy back the principal and unpaid interest of the debt for 41  cents in the dollar and revolving credits for 38 cents in the dollar.
Creditor banks have until June 29 to give their replies, opening the way  for the signature of specific agreements.
Under the terms of an agreement reached between Warsaw and the Club of  London in March, the private Polish debt is due to be reduced by about 45  percent and repayment spread over 30 years until 2024. Repayments would not  exceed 400 million dollars per year.
One of the options proposed as a means of reducing five to 10 percent of  the debt was a buy-back arrangement.
The Polish government, which hopes to obtain credits from the World bank  and International Monetary Fund (IMF) for this, has also offered to turn some  of the money owed to creditor banks into shares in Polish companies.
