Sales of new US homes dropped 6.8 percent in  April, following a revised 6.4 percent increase in the previous month, the  Commerce Department said Tuesday.
Last month's sharp drop surprised experts, who had predicted a 1.5 percent  increase.
The March figure was revised downward from an initial estimate of an 11.1  percent increase.
Sales of new homes fell to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of  683,000 in April, down from 733,000 in March.
On a 12-month basis, sales were down 0.3 percent.
The steepest declines were in the northeast, 16.9 percent, and in the  south, 14.1 percent.
Sales rose 16.9 percent in the Midwest.
The median price of a new home, the point at which half the homes sold for  more and half sold for less, fell to 129,000 dollars from 132,000 dollars in  March.
The average price was 153,900 dollars, down from 154,100 dollars.
