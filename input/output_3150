The Japanese NEC Corp. announced on Monday an  agreement to set up a computer software development venture in Beijing next  month with the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
The new company, NEC-CAS Software Laboratories Ltd., would be capitalised  at 150 million yen (1.5 million dollars) with NEC holding 90 percent and the  Institute of Software of the Academia Sinica holding the remaining 10 percent.
NEC said the venture would start operating in July with 50 employees at  first, rising to 200 at a later stage. Software sales were targeted to climb  from 60 million yen in the first year to 200 million yen by 1999.
The new company, said to be the first software devlopment venture in  China, would focus on developing open-system UNIX-based middleware and  computer-aided software engineering products for the Chinese market.
"Due to the progressive development of downsizing and open systems in  recent years, the demand for portable computers and workstations in China has  expanded rapidly," the Japanese company said.
"There is a high expectation of rapid growth in the personal computer and  workstation markets due to rapid growth in Chinese industry," it added.
NEC is the biggest manufacturer of personal computers in Japan, accounting  for about 50 percent of the local market.
