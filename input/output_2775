The outlawed Irish Republican Army abducted and  killed a British soldier in the province, police said Saturday, after the IRA  had earlier accused the man of spying on one of its members.
Police located the body of the man in a field near Armagh, southwest of  Belfast, but attempts to collect and identify the body were slowed down by  fears that mines or other booby-trap devices might have been planted nearby.
The soldier had been reported missing overnight Friday.
His brother and mother were killed several years ago in separate IRA  attacks, informed sources said Saturday.
An IRA spokesman said in a telephone call to a Belfast news outlet that  the man was "arrested" and interrogated before being shot because "he was  observing movements of a republican."
The killing brought to 31 the number of people killed in sectarian  violence in Northern Ireland this year.
