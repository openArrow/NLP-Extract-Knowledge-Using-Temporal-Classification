Cambodia's Khmer Rouge guerrillas attacked  Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans Tuesday, accusing him of "lighting  the fires of war" by talking of military aid for Phnom Penh.
In a broadcast monitored in Bangkok, Khmer Rouge radio said the  internationally-sponsored Paris peace accords on Cambodia banned the supply of  arms to any of the four Cambodian factions.
Gareth Evans' words will have the effect of "lighting the fires of war in  Cambodia by pitting the puppets of Vietnam and America against the (Khmer  Rouge)," the radio said.
Australia and the United States are among countries considering providing  military aid to Phnom Penh following an appeal by King Norodom Sihanouk to  save the country from the "yoke of the Khmer Rouge".
During the four-year Khmer Rouge rule from 1975, hundreds of thousands of  Cambodians died, until a Vietnamese invasion ousted the Khmer Rouge from Phnom  Penh. Hanoi announced the withdrawal of the last of its troops in 1989.
All four warring factions, including the Khmer Rouge, signed the 1991  Paris peace accords, but the Marxist faction refused to take part in May 1992  general elections and continued to wage guerrilla warfare.
Meanwhile, the radio Tuesday broadcast fresh reports of clashes in  widely-scattered areas, from Siem Reap, north of the capital, to the central  province of Pursat, and around Koh Kong, in the southwest, and Kampot, south  of Phnom Penh.
