China has indicated its readiness to consider  possible voluntary export restraints to curb the explosive growth in Chinese  textile exports to Japan, government sources were quoted as saying Friday.
The evening edition of the Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted international trade  and industry sources as saying that Chinese trade officials had informed the  ministry they were "studying" introducion of export controls.
The newspaper said the Chinese move was aimed at discouraging Japan from  restricting imports of textiles from China under the 1974 multilateral fibre  arrangement of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
But it also noted that a bilateral deal to "voluntarily" restrict the flow  of textile trade between the two countries could attract international  criticism of Japan while damaging China's bid to join GATT.
The ministry refused to confirm the report, but confirmed that Yukio Doi,  director general of its consumer goods industries bureau, was scheduled to  visit Beijing from May 23 for "regular" talks with Chinese trade officials.
Japan's imports of Chinese textile soared 31 percent to almost eight  billion dollars in the year to March, accounting for almost half of the  overall 24 percent jump in imports from the country to 21.7 billion dollars.
