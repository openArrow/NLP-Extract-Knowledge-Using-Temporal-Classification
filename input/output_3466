Sales at Japanese supermarkets in April fell two  percent to 1.27 trillion yen (12 billion dollars), the 20th year-on-year drop,  an industry group said Tuesday.
The decline in sales at 8,275 outlets was chiefly due to falling commodity  prices, the Japan Chain Stores Association said.
Sales of foodstuffs dropped 2.5 percent from a year earlier, while those  of clothing went down 5.9 percent, the association said.
