A federal judge has ordered an  all-male military college to make contingency plans to admit women in case he  rules in favor of admitting female students.
The ruling comes as the latest step in a drawn-out legal battle that could  end up being appealed all the way to the US Supreme Court.
The case originated when The Citadel accepted Shannon Faulkner in its  freshman class last year. Faulkner, 19, had all gender references removed from  her high school transcript records.
When The Citadel discovered she was female it revoked her acceptance. By  court order, The Citadel had to enroll Faulkner as a day student.
Faulkner filed a lawsuit seeking admission to the cadet corps, a  round-the-clock program.
US District Judge C. Weston Houck on Friday ordered the school, one of two  publicly funded all-male military colleges in the United States, 30 days to  file a plan to make provisions for female students.
He also ordered Faulkner's lawyers to submit their own proposals.
Houck recessed the trial and said he would likely rule on the case after  July 1.
Under the court order, the school must plan living accommodations for  women and measures for fighting sexual harassment or abuse that could result  from enrolling women.
The case mirrors that of the other all-male military academy, Virginia  Military Institute. VMI is under court order to become private or develop an  alternative women's program.
Citadel officials have said they will not convert to a private status.
Faulkner's attorneys read Houck's order as a sign the case was heading  toward their side.
"I'm hopeful, I'm extremely hopeful. We're going to go buy some  champagne," said attorney Valorie Vojdik.
Faulkner was not quite as excited. "I'm going to try to stay neutral,"  until the final decision she said. "I've been on so many emotional roller  coasters already," she added.
