A Palestinian policeman returned to the  territories for the first time in 27 years to find his long lost brother had  converted to Judaism and was seeking Israeli nationality, the daily Yediot  Aharonot said Thursday.
Mohammed Daames fled to Jordan 27 years ago at the start of the Israeli  occupation of the West Bank and the family village of Beit Omar, near Hebron.
He lost contact with his brother Kamel Yussef Daames, 45, but as soon as  he arrived at his post with the new Palestinian police force in the border  town of Rafah, in the autonomous Gaza Strip, he telephoned him to arrange a  meeting.
The paper did not say if the two brothers had actually met up again.
Kamel Yussef Daames is now married to an Israeli woman, with five  children, including a son about to join the army.
He has also applied to the interior ministry in Tel Aviv for Israeli  nationality, the paper said.
"I have chosen to become an Israeli and to live with my wife, Jacqueline  and my children," Daames said.
"My brother has chosen to live in the state of Palestine.
"The important thing is that there be no more bloodshed between our two  peoples. But, as far as I am concerned, I prefer to live in Israel."
An interior ministry spokesman told AFP that Daames had a permanent  Israeli  residence permit due to his marriage to an Israeli. He said there  should be no objection to his obtaining Israeli nationality if he fulfills the  requirements.
