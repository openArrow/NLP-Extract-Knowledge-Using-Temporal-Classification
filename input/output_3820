The United States Wednesday ruled out the  possibility of China's rejoining the world trade body by year-end because of  Beijing's demanding schedule to honour obligations required by membership.
"It is tough for anybody to do the amount of work that has to be done in  the little time that is left (between now and year-end)," deputy US trade  representative Booth Gardne told reporters here.
China, which was a founding member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT) but left after the communists came to power in 1949, has made it  clear that it attaches great political significance to being readmitted prior  to the inception of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
The WTO will on January 1 replace the Geneva-based GATT, which has  operated on an interim basis since 1947.
