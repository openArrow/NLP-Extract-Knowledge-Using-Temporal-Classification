The urine of two cats acting upon quicklime might  have caused a fire that burned down a farmer's barn in southern Japan, the  daily Mainichi Shimbun said Wednesday.
Firemen found two small cats' corpses and a package of 50 kilograms (111  pounds) of quicklime, a product listed as dangerous which becomes chemically  active when water is poured on it.
There was no other moisture or water in the barn at the time and it was  not raining then. Officials speculated that the fire broke out when the cats  peed on the paper bag of the quicklime last month in Kochi prefecture, 600  kilometers (375 miles) south of Tokyo.
An official of the fire department said however that it was still unclear  whether the urine caused the fire.
Farmers are allowed to use quicklime as a fertilizer.
