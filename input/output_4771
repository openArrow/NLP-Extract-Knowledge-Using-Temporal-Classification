The annualised growth in South Africa's  broad-based M3 money supply rose by 12.91 percent in April from March's  revised figure of 12.31 percent, according to official figures published  Friday.
Economists attributed the sharp increase in the M3 growth, which was well  outside the Reserve (central) Bank's 6-9 percent guideline range, to an  increase in the demand for credit, particularly in the government sector.
The M3 comprises cash and all bank deposits, including long-term savings.
