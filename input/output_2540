This is not the first time the two sides have tried to get the talks back  on track since February.
Kantor held a two-hour meeting with then Japanese foreign minister Tsutomu  Hata in Marrakesh last month, after which the two men said they would try to  find a basis of agreement to resume negotiations before the Group of Seven  summit in Naples in July.
Since the February collapse of the talks, Washington has said it will not  return to the negotiating table until Japan comes up with proposals that would  give a good chance of success.
This week's talks are at Japan's request, but Washington has made it clear  that it is not about to cave in simply to help save the precarious coalition  government now headed by Hata.
The talks came amid news of a worsening of the trade imbalance, with Japan  announcing Friday that its trade surplus with the United States expanded 8.9  percent in April to 4.4 billion dollars.
As the talks began Thursday, the US government released its March trade  figures showing a 25.4 percent boost in the trade deficit with Jaoan to 5.80  billion dollars.
Japanese vice-minister at the International Trade and Industry Ministry,  Sozaburu Okamatsu and deputy foreign minister for economic affairs Sakayuki  Hayashi are heading the Tokyo delegation.
The US team includes Deputy Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and  President Bill Clinton's deputy economic policy advisor Bowman Cutter as well  as Kantor.
The two sides are trying to agree on the definition of "objective  criteria" to measure progress in opening Japan's markets in the key areas of  government procurement, the auto trade, and financial services under a  framework agreement reached in July last year.
The government procurement talks cover computers, supercomputers,  satellites, medical technology and telecommunications.
