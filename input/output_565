Auxerre, inspired by striker Gerard Baticle,  clinched their first major honour of the club's history as they thrashed  Montpellier 3-0 in the French Cup final here on Saturday.
Guy Roux's side, whose only brush with glory came in a losing cup final  appearance in 1979, were always in control, with Baticle scoring the crucial  second and setting up the other two goals.
Montpellier's villain was right back Bertrand Reuzeau, who gifted Baticle  his goal three minutes after half-time.
The defender's back pass fell agonisingly short and Baticle shot across  Claude Barrabe.
The first goal, stabbed home on the rebound by mifielder Moussa Saib, came  after Baticle's low cross from the left was fumbled by the goalkeeper and  Baticle popped up on the right in the closing stages to cross for captain  Corentin Martins to finish.
Martins earned his score after hitting a curling free-kick onto the  crossbar in the first half with Barrabe well beaten.
