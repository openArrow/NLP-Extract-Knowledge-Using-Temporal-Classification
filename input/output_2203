The last team to play with the hammer and sickle on their shirts, in the  1990 World Cup, never got its act together although they at last got to play  Maradona.
Argentina won a scrappy match, and, yes, Maradona handled the ball on his  own goal line, and the only man NOT to spot it was the referee -- Mr  Fredriksson again.
Yugoslavia's exclusion and Hungary's decline left only Greece as a real  obstacle in Russia's path to USA 94. They drew 1-1 at home and lost by a  single goal in Athens when both teams had already qualified.
Those two goals, and the couple they let in against Hungary and Iceland,  were the only times goalkeeper Dimitri Kharin, who plays for English FA Cup  finalists Chelsea, was beaten in 10 qualifying matches.
The 51-year-old Sadyrin, who coached Zenit Leningrad and CSKA Moscow to  Soviet titles, says that despite the turmoil Russia can do well.
"This time we will be be much better prepared not only physically but  mentally as well," he said.
However it is difficult to know just how open-minded he says he is. "You  cannot work with people unless you give them your whole support," he said  enigmatically.
Russia, who begin their World Cup campaign in San Francisco against Brazil  on June 20, also face Sweden and Cameroon in one of the hardest groups.
