UN special envoy to ex-Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi,  has written to the warring parties in Bosnia calling for a speedy resumption  of talks on a republic-wide ceasefire, the UN Protection Force said here  Saturday.
In letters sent to Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Bosnian Serb  leader Radovan Karadzic the UN special representative proposed "a framework  for an immediate end to fighting which includes provisions for the  disengagement of forces and the interpositioning of UNPROFOR between those  forces."
The plan also called for "the withdrawal, or storage under UNPROFOR  control, of heavy weapons, the unrestricted freedom of movement for all  UNPROFOR, UNHCR and humanitarian agencies, including the use of helicopters,  the release of all POWs and the establishment of joint commissions" to  supervise the peace.
Akashi said he had established an UNPROFOR task force, under his  chairmanship and composed of senior civilian and military officials, to assist  the parties to the conflict in securing a peace agreement.
The Japanese diplomat also sent a letter to Serbian President Slobodan  Milosevic "requesting his personal support for this important initiative."
Akashi's move follows the May 13 meeting of foreign ministers from the  United States, Russia and five European Union member states which gave 15 days  for the warring sides to restart peace talks and four months to find a peace  settlement.
