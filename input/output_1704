Students at the University of Lagos began their  first  semester examinations Wednesday amid tight security on and outside the  campus.
More than 300 police, armed with guns and teargas, were stationed at the  two main entrances to the university, while two police vans patrolled the  campus.
The unusual security presence in and around the university follows threats  this week by some student leaders to disrupt the examinations if they went  ahead on Wednesday on the grounds that students, who have only just returned  to school, needed more time for preparation.
The university was closed last March 12 after violent clashes triggered by  members of campus secret cults. It was only reopened on Monday.
Despite boycott threats by some students, the university authorities said  that the examinations would go ahead as planned to prevent further disruption  of the academic calendar.
The atmosphere on the campus was quiet at noon. A teacher told AFP that he  was afraid the current strike by members of the non-academic staff union  (NASU) might affect the examinations. They are fighting for better conditions  of service.
The University of Lagos is one of the three biggest and oldest  universities in nigeria.
