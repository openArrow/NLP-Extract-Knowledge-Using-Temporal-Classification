Officials from Rwanda's self-styled government  fled their base in the town of Gitarama on Sunday as rebel fighters advanced  towards the area, a UN spokesman said.
"Our information is that a substantial number of government officials have  left Gitarama for Kibuye (west) and Butare (south), but some are still there,"  spokesman Abdul Kabia said, contacted by telephone from Nairobi.
It was not immediately clear whether the interim Prime Minister Jean  Kambanda was among the officials who fled.
The self-declared interim government fled Kigali on April 12, and  established their base near Gitarama, 50 kilometres, (35 miles) southwest of  the capital, after Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) rebels launched their  offensive on the city.
The rebels have been tightening their grip on Kigali over the past couple  of weeks and were now reported to have advanced within seven kilometres (five  miles) of Gitarama.
Rwanda plunged back into turmoil a day after President Juvenal Habyarimana  was killed in an alleged attack on his plane on April 6.
An estimated 200,000 to half a million people have been killed in the  ensueing wholesale slaughter, mainly pitting Habyarimana's majority Hutu tribe  against minority Tutsis.
The RPF launched an offensive against government troops and Hutu militia,  saying they wanted to stop the massacres and "cripple the war machinery  responsible for killings."
