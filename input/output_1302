Belgian coach Paul Van Himst has omitted  Brazilian-born Luis Oliveira from his World Cup squad because he thought the  player would disrupt team unity.
Oliveira, who plays for the Italian side Cagliari, recently criticised Van  Himst and some of the players.
Croatian-born Josip Weber, whose 31 goals for Cercle Bruges made him the  leading scorer in Belgium for the third year running, is called up a month  after becoming a Belgian citizen.
Bruges defender Pascal Renier, who marked his opposing forward out of the  game in every important league match this year, and his club goalkeeper Dany  Verlinden are two other uncapped players.
Michel De Wolf, 36, is going to his third finals. "He's still the best  sweeper in Belgium," Van Himst said.
He picked seven players each from champions Anderlecht and runners-up  Bruges.
