David Beck, International Promotions Manager for Williams's main sponsors,  Rothmans, said in London on Monday there was "no pressure from us" on Williams  about the replacement for Ayrton Senna.
"It is up to Williams to choose the best drivers," he said.
Asked about the rumours of re-signing Mansell, Beck said: "There would be  an immediate media impact, but we are looking to the long term as well. We are  definitely in Formula One until the end of 1995. We want to win races as soon  as possible, but we want to be winning races this time next year."
