Drivers began making deals to find better cars. France's Stephan Gregoire  moved into a car vacated by former Indy pole sitter Pancho Carter, but had a  top lap of just 214 mph (342 km/h).
"He signed on this morning and has been working with the car all day,"  said Lisa Krueger, a spokesman for Gregoire's new team.
Finland's Tero Palmroth, driving a car vacated by retired Al Unser Snr and  Brazilian Roberto Moreno, and Jeff Andretti, son of Mario Andretti and younger  brother of Michael, each reached 215 mph (344 km/h).
Some teams just gave up. Scotland's Jim Crawford ended his bid after 215  mph laps, realizing the car could never challenge for a spot in the field.
Gary Bettenhausen, who crashed in practice Saturday, was trying to make  his 22nd Indy field. His car had been at competitive speed before the  accident, but not since.
Brazilian rookie Marco Greco had the closest call. His car's top speed  through the first half of practice Sunday was just below qualifying level.
