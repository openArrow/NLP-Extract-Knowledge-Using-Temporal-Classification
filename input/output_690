General Romeo Dallaire, head of the UN assistance mission in Rwanda, said  the RPF, made up of soldiers trained in guerrilla warfare, realizes it stands  to lose too much in an all-out assault on Kigali and has thus adopted a tactic  of "isolation, harassment and infiltration."
He said that by progressively wearing down their ennemies, the rebels, who  control large chunks of the northern and eastern parts of the country, hope to  be able to tighten their stranglehold around Kigali by gaining ground from the  southeast before launching a final assault.
The RPF has been ransacking military bases, fighting for control of the  road leading to the capital's airport, and lobbing mortars on the city centre  where officials building are located.
But some of the mortars, either accidentally or intentionally, have fallen  on city streets or refugee centres, terrorising civilians already struggling  to survive on little water and food.
Meanwhile Dallaire is trying to broker a ceasefire among the warring  parties while the UN Security Council is to vote next week on sending UN  reinforcements to the war-ravaged country.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Right, Jose Ayala Lasso, who visited  Kigali last week, made an impassioned plea Friday for the world to end the  "unimaginable human tragedy" in Rwanda.
"The world must do something to halt this violence," Ayala said.
