Iranians need not fear Coca Cola as an American  threat to their cultural heritage, parliamentary speaker Ali Akbar Nategh Nuri  said Tuesday.
"Raising the Coca Cola issue would be exaggerating the importance of the  United States and ignoring our own," he told a press conference. "We should  not fear it. Our culture is much too strong to be threatened by the drink."
Iranian radicals have waged a fierce campaign to close a Coca Cola  factory, which opened here in September 1992 for the first time since the 1979  Islamic revolution.
Considering the soft drink to be a symbol of US economic and cultural  domination, Islamic activists recently tore down 1,800 signs and posters  advertising Coca Cola and other US products in the eastern city of Mashhad.
Last week a group of radical students rallied against the importation of  US products, notably Coca Cola, while a group of deputies asked parliament to  ban activities by companies here under American licence.
Despite the opposition, another US soft drink, Pepsi Cola, is also  preparing to return to the Iranian market for the first time since the  revolution which deposed the pro-Western shah.
However, Nategh Nuri denied there were any high-level contacts between  Iran and the United States.
"No one has the right to engage in high-level contacts with the Americans  without the authorisation" of spiritual guide Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, he said.  "Like the leader said, the way to resuming ties with the United States is a  dead end."
The Iranian daily, Salam, said last week that the United States had sent a  message to Iran on opening direct and formal negotiations.
Tehran and Washington broke diplomatic ties in 1980 after Iranian radical  students stormed the US embassy here and took its staff hostage.
