<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><TimeML><TIMEX3 tid="t0" functionInDocument="CREATION_TIME"/>Omaha was the beach where the D-Day <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">invasion</EVENT> almost  <EVENT eid="e2" class="I_ACTION" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">failed</EVENT>.&#13;
The US first infantry division, the "Big Red One," and the 29th infantry  division <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">landed</EVENT> at 6:30 a.m. to a horrible surprise. The air bombardments had  not <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="NEG" modality="none">eliminated</EVENT> their targets, the extensive system of mines and tank traps the  Germans had <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">laid</EVENT> and that were <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">exposed</EVENT> at low tide.&#13;
Also, the Nazi 352nd infantry division was there by chance, a well-armed,  top-level force of 12,000 men.&#13;
And they had ideal conditions in which to <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">respond</EVENT> to an attacking force.  The six-kilometre (four-mile) beach was at the foot of cliffs that gave good  vision to fields of fire that <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">formed</EVENT> an effective killing box.&#13;
The morning was a massacre. Some 3,000 allied soldiers eventually <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">died</EVENT> at  Omaha, many drowning as the tide <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">came</EVENT> in on them.&#13;
But US General Omar Bradley <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">persisted</EVENT>. Reinforcements and ammunition were  <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">brought</EVENT> in, while the Germans, <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">pinned</EVENT> down by air and naval fire, were unable  to <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">re-supply</EVENT>.&#13;
Special Ranger forces <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">managed</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">reach</EVENT> the German lines and <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">destroyed</EVENT>  bunkers.&#13;
Finally, US <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">soldiers</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">stormed</EVENT> up a grassy bluff towards Vierville. Two  destroyers <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">closed</EVENT> towards the shore to face-off against German heavy guns.&#13;
By evening the Americans had <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">secured</EVENT> Omaha beach, <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">facing</EVENT> the towns of  Vierville, Collevillle-sur-Mer and Saint-Laurent, northwest of Bayeux.&#13;
