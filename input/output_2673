Albania's last communist president, Ramiz Alia, and  nine of his top aides went on trial Saturday for ordering summary executions  and taking money from the public coffers.
The charges of criminal abuse of office also cover the shooting of fleeing  refugees at the border and deportations.
"I have no address, and you can put down whatever you want as my  profession," the 67-year-old Alia told the court.
The trial of Alia, who was chief ideologist to long-time Albanian  communist ruler Enver Hoxha and served as president from 1982 to 1992, has  raised little interest in Tirana, and security at the court was light.
The other defendents in the trial include former prime minister Adil  Carcani, former interior ministers Simon Stefani and Hekuran Isai and  communist party officials Manush Muftiu and Rita Marko.
