Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer hinted  on Thursday that no further cut in interest rates was imminent.
In a speech to the University of Halle in eastern Germany, he said that  perspectives for key interest rates had been "settled for some time to come"  with the bank's latest cuts of a week ago.
The discount rate now stands at 4.5 percent compared to 8.75 percent in  September 1992, with the Lombard rate down to six percent from 9.75 percent.
Tietmeyer said the German central bank had been able to reduce rates to  their current levels without jeopardising the value of the mark and despite  narrowed differentials between US and European rates.
He said the latest reduction should encourage long-term investment and  thus slow the growth in M3 money supply, although they was not expected to  influence the April figure, due in a few days.
Tietmeyer said it was in the long term "crucial" that the mark remain  stable because a replacement for it as Europe's "currency anchor" was not in  view.
The central bank boss called for a political environment that would allow  progress toward European economic and currency union, saying: "The contours of  a future political union are currently rather fuzzy."
Governments had had the opportunity to clarify these countours when they  met to review the Maastricht treaty in 1996, he said.
