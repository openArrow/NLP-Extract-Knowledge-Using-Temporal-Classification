Nick Faldo has escaped a fine for  refusing to give a Press conference after the first round of the PGA  championship.
The Englishman, unhappy after three-putting four times in his opening 72,  stormed off the course on Friday, shrugging aside journalists and PGA  officials before yelling to David Leadbeater, his coach, to bring some extra  putters.
However, tournament director John Paramor spoke to Faldo after his second  round 70 on Saturday, and said: "No action will be taken. I'm happy with the  reasons and the circumstances."
Two years ago, in Spain, Ian Woosnam was fined 500 pounds after refusing a  request to be interviewed.
Faldo is now two under par for a championship he has won a record four  times.
Seve Ballesteros, seven times a winner at Wentworth, fired a nine-birdie  second round 66 to revive his hopes.
Ballesteros was in danger of missing the half-way cut for the third  successive time in the championship, when he resumed on one over par.
But he chipped in twice and had a mere 24 putts to climb on to the five  under par total of 139.
It left him five behind new leader Miguel Angel Jimenez, who also shot 66  to move into a three-stroke lead over fellow Spaniard Jose Maria Olazabal, the  US Masters champion.
Woosnam, meanwhile, missed his first half-way cut in Europe for over two  years, adding a 75 to his opening 73 for a four over par total of 148.
The last time Woosnam bowed out early was the 1992 Benson and Hedges  International 30 events ago.
Jimenez, whose only tour victory came in the 1992 Belgian Open, raced to  the turn in 31 and enjoyed a hat-trick of birdies from the 11th.
The 30-year-old former caddie from Malaga three-putted the 14th and 16th,  however, and needed a 35-foot putt on the next to stretch his lead again.
