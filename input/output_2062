A Chinese director with a film entered at  the Cannes Film Festival has been barred from leaving his country to present  it, a source close to the movie said Thursday.
The incident is the second involving a Chinese director with a film at the  festival being absent.
Yin Li, who directed "Story of Xinghua," has been denied an exit visa  along with the whole of the cast of the film, a representative of its  production company said here.
The representative said the film had also failed so far to obtain the  censors' certificate needed for the film to be shown within China, but gave no  further details.
On Monday it was announced that Zhang Yimou, whose film "Huozhe" (To Live)  is widely-tipped to do well in the competition, announced he was not coming  because his film had not yet been authorized for screening in China.
"Xinghua," produced by the Youth Film Studio of the Beijing Film Academy,  was shown in October last year at the first international film festival in  Shanghai.
It tells the story of Wanglai, a grocer who makes his fortune selling  stones stolen from the Great Wall of China. It ends tragically after a hunt  for a legendary treasure buried under the wall.
Yin Li, 36, is seen as the leader of the 'sixth generation' of Chinese  filmmakers, following the fifth generation whose leading exponents include  Zhang and Chen Kaige, whose "Farewell to My Concubine" was joint winner of the  coveted Golden Palm last year.
Festival director Gilles Jacob, contacted on the matter, said he was not  aware of it and declined any further comment. Officials in Beijing have so far  declined to comment either.
