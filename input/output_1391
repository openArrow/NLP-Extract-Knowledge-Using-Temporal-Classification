German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel insisted  Tuesday that Russia must not be granted an official veto over whether eastern  and central European countries join NATO.
He said this rule also should apply to membership of the Western European  Union, effectively the military wing of the European Union.
Kinkel was in Vienna with his Dutch counterpart, Pieter Koijmans, to  present a joint initiative on strengthening the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in the area of conflict prevention.
Speaking at a press conference, they expressed hope that the plan would be  approved at a CSCE summit in December in Budapest.
Kinkel said that in the wake of the Cold War, eastern and central European  countries needed to avoid "new divisions" and that this was why NATO's  Partnership for Peace plan was open to both Russia and them.
The Russians, he noted, want to join the partnership but "are seeking  certain specific rules in their negotiations with the alliance."
The plan offers military cooperation in a number of areas between NATO and  mainly the former Warsaw Pact countries but stops short of offering full  membership any time soon.
It was conceived in January by the United States as a way to respond to  eastern European countries' pleas for greater security at a time of political  volatility and growing nationalism in Russia without alienating Russia itself.
On the CSCE, Koijmans said one of the main goals of the German-Dutch  initiative was to boost the CSCE as a regional organization to help the United  Nations.
"When we see that the United Nations is not in a position to do everything  asked of it around the world, it is important to consolidate regional  organizations to help the United Nations," Koijmans said.
