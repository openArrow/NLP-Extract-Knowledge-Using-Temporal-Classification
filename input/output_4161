The German mark lifted against the main European  currencies on Thursday morning as widespread falls on stock markets and in  futures caused investors to turn to the mark as a safe-haven currency.
In Paris, the dollar was firmer against the yen as market rumours said the  Bundesbank and the Bank of France were intervening to prop up the US currency,  dealers said.
In London, the dollar declined to 1.6430 marks against 1.6440 at the  Wednesday close. Sterling was also lower at 2.4801 marks from 2.4829, while  the mark lifted to 3.4220 French francs from 3.42 and to 972 lire from 968.
"The weakness of the financial markets has provoked a rush into the mark,"  said Paul Hammett, analyst at the bank Paribas Capital Markets.
The escudo was particularly under pressure, trading at 103.75 to the mark  from 103.50, despite intervention by the Bank of Portugal on Wednesday.
The Scandinavian currencies were also among the first victims of the  mark's rise, with the Swedish krona slipping to 4.7380 to the mark from 4.7225  at the previous close.
Dealers believe there will be no more cuts in Germany's key rates after  the Bundesbank's weak cut in the securities repurchasing agreement (repo) on  Wednesday by three basis points to 5.2 percent and after various statements by  its president, Hans Tietmeyer.
The market is not looking for cuts at Thursday's bi-monthly meeting of the  executive council, dealers said. At its last meeting two weeks ago, the  Bundesbank cut both its key rates by 0.5 percent to 4.5 percent for the  discount rate and to six percent for the Lombard rate.
By midmorning, the dollar was trading at 1.6430 marks from 1.6440 at the  Wednesday close, at 104.15 yen from 104.45, at 1.4005 Swiss francs from  1.4012, but was unchanged at 5.6238 French francs.
Sterling was trading at 1.5095 dollars from 1.5103, at 2.4801 marks from  2.4829, at 157.21 yen from 157.75, at 2.1141 Swiss francs from 2.1162 and at   8.4874 French francs from 8.4936.
In Paris, the rumours of central bank intervention to support the dollar  against the yen caused dealers to be cautious.
"The market is therefore very reticent about speculating on a fall in the  greenback," an analyst at one US bank said, adding that the French franc  remained relatively stable against the mark.
Futures on the Matif opened slightly higher, with the June contract  lifting 0.14 points to 119.24.
By midmorning, the mark was trading at 3.4212 French francs from 3.4200 at  the end of the day.
The dollar was lower at 1.6428 marks from 1.6450, at 104.15 yen from  104.45 yen, and at 5.6202 French francs from 5.6310 at the previous close.
