At midnight on June 6, the fighting had died down across the Normandy  front. Hitler held a second staff meeting on how to react to the invasion.
The British were holding Ouistreham and both banks of the Orne, and were  moving on Caen.
Further west, the Canadians and the British were controlling an area 35  kilometres (22 miles) across and 15 kilometres (nine miles) deep.
The situation was more precarious on the American side, where the troops  were having trouble linking up.
But the battle for the beaches had been won. In all 156,000 men had landed  in a single day. Allied casualties stod at 10,000 killed, wounded or missing.
And euphoria of the successful assault was soon to subside in the days  ahead during the difficult battle for Normandy.
