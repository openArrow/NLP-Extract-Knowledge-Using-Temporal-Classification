Israeli commandos met with no  resistance as they kidnapped a Moslem fundamentalist guerrilla chief in a  slick pre-dawn raid on his home on Saturday, his brother said.
"There were around 25 men all dressed in Israeli military uniform," said  Sobhi Dirani, the brother of Mustafa Dirani who was snatched by the  helicopter-borne commandos from his home in Syrian-controlled eastern Lebanon.
"They did not meet with any resistance when they grabbed Mustapha in front  of his family," and no one was hurt, he said.
Mustafa Dirani, 46, is held responsible by Israel for the capture of  airman Ron Arad whose plane was shot down over south Lebanon in 1986. The  abduction is seen as a bargaining chip in the release of the pilot.
"No one in the village heard the helicopters which brought the commandos.
"The soldiers stormed the house out of nowhere and immediately went into  the bedroom where my brother and his wife were sleeping," Sobhi Dirani said.
"They handcuffed me with cuffs made in England and pointed their guns at  my father, my sister-in-law and her three children, grabbed my brother and  fled on foot. The whole thing lasted 10 minutes," the 26-year-old added.
He said the commandos spoke in Hebrew with each other "but they spoke to  us in Arabic."
Lebanese army troops threw a security cordon around the Niha hills, which  overlook Qsarnabaa, five kilometers (three miles) away where the two  helicopters used by the commandos had landed.
Witnesses said the commandos drove by jeep from the hill to Dirani's  house, which is located on the edge of the village, and drove back to the  waiting choppers.
Some villagers said they had seen an exchange of light signals before the  operation, suggesting that the commandos had accomplices inside the village  who gave them the all clear.
