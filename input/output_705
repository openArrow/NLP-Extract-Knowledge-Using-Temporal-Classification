Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and another  senior Thai government official have called on ASEAN member countries to  oppose western military aid to Phnom Penh, local dailies reported Sunday.
The comments by the prime minister came only days after the Cambodian  monarch, King Norodom Sihanouk, said foreign military assistance might be the  only way to end his government's continuing military conflict with the Khmer  Rouge.
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) "is in a good position  to voice opposition to any foreign interference in Cambodia's internal  affairs," Chuan was quoted as saying in The Nation daily.
While ASEAN members have not agreed on a policy for military aid to  Thailand's eastern neighbor, Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said  the regional organization "still wants to see a political settlement and  national reconciliation within Cambodia," the Bangkok Post daily reported.
Last week, Australia, the United States and France began discussing the  possibility of sending weapons to support Phnom Penh's continuing struggle  with Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
Thailand has criticized the idea repeatedly, saying a renewed influx of  arms would result in a prolonging of the conflict, as well as widespread  gun-running and banditry.
But Chuan, quoted in The Nation, allowed that Cambodia had a "sovereign  right to ask for a foreign arms supply."
Phnom Penh has been invited to attend as an observer the July meeting of  ASEAN foreign ministers in Bangkok.
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Phillipines, Singapore and  Thailand.
