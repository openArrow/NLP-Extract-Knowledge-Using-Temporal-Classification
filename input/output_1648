Vietnam and the United States are only weeks away  from a final agreement to open liaison offices in each other's capitals as a  step towards establishing full diplomatic ties, a senior official said  Wednesday.
Vice Foreign Minister Le Mai told a visiting delegation of US veterans  that the two sides had reached agreement on most of the issues and were ready  to exchange final documents concerning the opening of the offices.
Final approval from the two governments was expected in a matter of weeks,  the minister, who heads the North American department of the foreign ministry,  said in a meeting with a delegation from the Vietnam Veterans of America.
US and Vietnamese officials began talks on opening liaison offices shortly  after President Bill Clinton lifted a decades-old trade ban in February.
The offices would be the first formal representation by the US government  in Vietnam since the closing of the former embassy in Ho Chi Minh City, when  the former Saigon fell to communist forces in 1975.
Currently three US diplomats are stationed in Hanoi on an informal basis  to help in the search for American personnel still listed as missing in action  from the conflict in Indochina.
Two technical teams from the State Department visited Hanoi earlier this  month to discuss details of setting up the offices.
But full diplomatic relations may be some time off as the two sides are  yet to resolve several issues, including that of assets frozen by both sides  after the war.
More than 500 million US dollars in assets are held by both sides, with  American companies claiming some 230 million dollars seized by the Vietnamese.
Washington is also still demanding "the fullest possible" accounting of  the 2,234 MIAs and has held one round of talks on the human rights situation  in Vietnam.
Winston Lord, US assistant secretary of state for Asia-Pacific affairs,  has said that human rights would be an important factor in any decision on  normalising relations.
