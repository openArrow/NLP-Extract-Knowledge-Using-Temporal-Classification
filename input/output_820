China is to offer financial incentives to  service companies to take on jobless workers as it battles to keep the urban  unemployment rate below three per cent, the China Daily said Monday.
Vice Labour Minister Zhu Jiazhen said Saturday that service companies  would get tax emptions and priority in obtaining bank loans and materials if  60 percent of new jobs went to unemployed workers, the report said.
State and private firms would be encouraged to set up such businesses, he  said. In the past, most service companies have been linked to state  enterprises.
"One of the best ways to control unemployment is to give full play to the  service industries irrespective of their ownership," said Zhu, adding that  efforts, including experimentation with share-holding, would be made to give  the businesses more autonomy from their parent firm.
Some 4.1 million people, or 2.6 percent of the urban workforce, were  unemployed in China by the end of last year, up from 2.4 percent in 1992. The  figure is expected to hit five million this year.
Labour Minister Li Boyong said last month the unemployment situation was  "extremely difficult," reflecting concerns that efforts to cut 10 million jobs  in loss-making state firms will lead to social unrest.
The influx of tens of millions of labourers from the countryside, where  some 130 million people are without work, is also putting pressure on city job  markets.
The labour ministry has launched a programme to register all urban jobless  to facilitate efforts to offer them work opportunities and expand the  unemployment benefit system.
Some 900,000 workers received unemployment benefit in 1993 and the figure  is forecast to rise to 1.8 million this year.
The China Daily said the ministry had also initiated a training programme  to help unemployed workers improve their skills.
