The Footsie rose slightly during the week, despite  constantly looking over its shoulder at US shares and futures prices and  generally taking little heed of reassuring performances from British companies.
The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closed at 3,119.2 points on Friday,  a weekly rise of 13.2 points or 0.4 percent.
The index owes this slight weekly rise to a signifcant lift on Tuesday,  when shares rose 1.2 percent on hopes that the Bundesbank would cut key  interest rates at its bi-monthly meeting on Wednesday.
Hopes of a cut in British rates were firmly squashed on Thursday after  Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England governor Eddie  George warned of the dangers of overheating the economy.
In its quarterly report, the Bank of England also expressed concern about  a resurfacing of inflation, particularly after British consumer credits rose  by a record 516 million pounds (774 million dollars) in March, compared to  analysts' expectations of 325 million pounds.
Insurance companies in general gained little from better first-quarter  results.
Commercial Union, which almost quadrupled its pre-tax profits to 64  million pounds, dipped seven pence to 568, while General Accident fell two  pence to 559 despite a 46 percent hike in pre-tax profits, and Royal Insurance  inched up one pence to 261.
The media group Pearson was one of the main winners during the week,  soaring 41 pence to 673 after announcing a joint satellite television venture  with the BBC.
British Gas rose eight pence to 301.5, as the market belatedly welcomed a  report by the industry watchdog Ofgas on increased competition in the gas  distribution sector.
SmithKline Beecham rose 12 pence to 406 after announcing it was to market  a generic form of cimetidine, the main ingredient in its anti-ulcer drug  Tagamet, in the US.
The Royal Bank of Scotland jumped 25 pence to 432 after doubling its  half-yearly pre-tax profits to 201 million pounds.
But investors were not impressed by results from Unilever and Grand  Metropolitan. Unilever slumped 51 pence to 1,023 while Grand Met fell 14 pence  to 453 after reporting prudent provisions for its drinks brands.
Finally, British Airways fell 25 pence to 391 as dealers were worried about  the company's intention to complete its first flight from London to Paris'  Orly airport despite opposition from the French government.
