After White's family emigrated from Leeds to Melbourne when he was seven,   he soon became an avid fan of Aussie Rules football and ultimately represented  Australia at youth level cricket.
"When I returned from Australia to play for Yorkshire in 1990 I regarded  myself as Australian,"he said today.
"Since then, however, I have settled in Scarborough and married a local  girl. I now think of myself as 100% English.
"I knew Ray Illingworth was watching me during the past week and I just  tried to do my best for Yorkshire. I have tried to be positive and aggressive  in my cricket and that has paid off."
Chairman of selectors Illingworth laughed off the suggestion that his  first Test side has shown a Yorkshire bias with the selection of White,  Richard Stemp and Steve Rhodes.
Illingworth said: "Stemp may play for Yorkshire but he's not a  Yorkshireman - he comes from Birmingham and played for Worcestershire! Anyway,  they do say that a strong Yorkshire means a strong England!"
