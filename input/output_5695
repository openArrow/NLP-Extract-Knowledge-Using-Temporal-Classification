Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said here  Tuesday that the government was unable to stop the Philippine peso from  appreciating against the US dollar without the risk of fuelling inflation.
Singson made the admission in talks with exporters who have been clamoring  for the government to stop the rise of the peso, which rose from 27.7 pesos to  the dollar two months ago to about 26.8 pesos on Monday.
Singson said the Central Bank had already bought a total of 145 billion  pesos (5.2 billion dollars) from the system since January 1991, but that  commercial banks were now simply charging less for dollars than the Central  Bank was.
He rejected the option of buying more dollars and releasing more pesos  into the system, saying this would fuel inflation.
He also said the appreciation of the peso was due to a continued influx of  dollars into the system, noting that official remittances from Filipinos  working overseas amounted to 591 million dollars in the first three months of  the year.
Economists believe the amount of unofficial remittances is much higher.
Singson also noted that foreign equity investments in this country in the  first three months reached 561 million dollars while portfolio investments hit  765 million dollars and tourist revenues reached 260 million dollars.
Singson said they hoped to help exporters by further liberalizing foreign  exchange transactions.
