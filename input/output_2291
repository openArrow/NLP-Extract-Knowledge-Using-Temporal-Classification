New Zealand's unarmed police force is to give  up the traditional bobby's helmet for Australian-style wide-brimmed akubra  hats,  Police Commissioner Richard Macdonald said Friday.
The bobby's helmet has been worn by police here since 1913 but was  increasingly unpopular with New Zealand police as it did not protect the wear  from the sun.
A police survey found 44 percent wanted the akubra, 43 percent wanted a  forage cap currently also in use and only six percent wanted to retain the  helmet. The helmet was never worn by 38 percent of police, the survey  revealed.
The bobby's helmet was an inheritance from colonial days when Britain  governed New Zealand. It still remains in use in Western Samoa, which New  Zealand ruled up until 1968.
Police historian Senior Constable Barry Thomson said Friday there was some  sentimental attachment to the helmets for police on the beat.
Apart from protecting the wearer from the occasional blow from a villain,  the helmet also provided useful storage for police accoutrements, including  crayons for marking road accidents, transistor radios, occasionally a bladder  of wine, but most important of all, food.
Thomson said while it was sad to see the helmets pass into history they  would only repel an attack if a blow was delivered directly to the top of the  helmet.
"If you get a sideways blow they don't hold much at all. They bobble off  the head pretty easily."
