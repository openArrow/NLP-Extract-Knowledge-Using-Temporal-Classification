Russian President Boris Yeltsin Monday extended a  state of emergency to disputed border areas of the breakaway republic of  Chechnya and neighbouring Ingushetia, to the west.
Chechnya, a tiny Moslem republic which declared its independence from  Moscow in October 1991, predicted the move last Thursday, warned that it "will  be considered by Chechnya as an act of military aggression," and put its armed  forces on alert.
Yeltsin's decree extends the state of emergency to the disputed regions of  Sunzha and Malgobek, both claimed by Chechnya, for two months.
The Russian president ordered troops to close Chechnya's borders last  December, ahead of national elections which Chechnya boycotted.
Dudayev has periodically put the Chechen security forces on alert during  the continuing standoff with Moscow,
Authorities in the breakaway Caucasus republic earlier Monday accused the  Russian secret service of staging an assassination attempt last Friday on  President Dzhokhar Dudayev. Moscow denied the allegations.
Dudayev escaped unhurt from a car-bomb attack in which his interior  minister and deputy as well as their driver were killed.
The Chechnya cabinet met in emergency session after the attack and imposed  a curfew for a month.
Dudayev's Interior Minister Magomed Eldiyev, his deputy Said Ali Bateyev,  in charge of criminal affairs, and their driver were killed, a spokesman said.  The three men were travelling in the first vehicle of the motorcade.
Dudayev was in the second car, which was jolted by the explosion.
According to the spokesman, an initial assessment of the debris from the  attack showed that the explosives were "of the same type as those used by  Russian intelligence services for sabotage and terrorism."
In March, the Interfax news agency reported that Dudayev's official  residence was attacked by a guided rocket which broke a window but caused no  casualties.
