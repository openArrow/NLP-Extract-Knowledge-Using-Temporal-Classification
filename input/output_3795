Japan's Toshiba Corp., International Business  Machines Corp. (IBM) of the United States and Siemens AG of Germany said  Wednesday they had agreed to develop a 64-megabit dynamic random access memory  (DRAM) chip.
The three companies, which established an alliance to develop 256-megabit  DRAM chips two years ago, said in a joint statement that the second-generation  64-megabit chip would be smaller than those made by NEC Corp. and others.
Sample shipments are expected to begin "within a few years," a Toshiba  spokesman said, adding that the chips would be manufactured with all three  companies using the same process.
The new chip will be developed and designed at two IBM laboratories in New  York and Vermont and the three companies will send similar numbers of  engineers to each laboratory, the Toshiba spokesman said.
"The whole essence of our combined efforts is to deliver to our customers  the very best products at the best possible costs," IBM vice president for  microelectronocs Michael Attardo said in the statement.
Masanobu Ohyama, vice president for semiconductors at Toshiba, asserted  that the two-year-old project to develop the 256-megabit DRAM "is going very  well" despite recent reports to the contrary.
