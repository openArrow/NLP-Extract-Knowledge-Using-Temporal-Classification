Defending champion Patty Sheehan  fired a three-under-par 68 at the windblown LPGA Championship Friday to breeze  into share of the halfway lead with Robin Walton.
Sheehan began the day back in 17th place, but four birdies and just one  bogey put her at two-under 140 through two rounds.
Walton's 70 included a double bogey and a bogey as well as four birdies.
The pair were trailed by overnight leader Alice Ritzman, who carded a 73  for 141.
They were the only three golfers under par after two rounds on the par 71  DuPont Country Club course.
Briton Laura Davies eagled her last hole for a 72 that put her on 142,  tied with Meg Mallon.
"The wind gusted and came from everywhere," said Ritzman, who is seeking  her first victory in 17 years on the tour. "It seemed like it changed  direction every five seconds. It was a nightmare."
The winds pushed up the cut to nine-over, the highest on the women's tour  this year.
"I shoot like this every week," Walton said. "But usually I get trashed."
Given the conditions and her own recent run of indifferent play, Hall of  Famer Sheehan ecstatic after her round.
"I'm just thrilled to death," she said. "It was probably one of my best  rounds of the year."
She got three birdies in her first five holes -- at 11, 12 and 15.
"That certainly put me in a good position, knowing I was not in danger of  missing the cut," she said. "It was the first time this year I felt in  control."
Moving to the front nine, Sheehan birdied the second, then gave one back  at eight where she left her approach short with a three-iron.
"I had a brain hemorrhage," she said. "I used the wrong club. It's as  simple as that."
While Sheehan was moving up from 17th place, overnight co-leader Dottie  Mochrie was dropping back to the same spot with a 78 for 146.
She closed with a dreadful double bogey, missing a 12-foot putt for par,  then angrily knocking the remaining two-inch putt past the hole.
