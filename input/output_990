Northern troops on Monday captured the south's main  air base of Al-Anad which controls a key highway leading to the southern  stronghold of Aden, the official Yemeni news agency Saba said.
The agency, run by the north, said Saleh's troops were "mopping up the  last pockets of the rebel forces in Al-Anad base," around 60 kilometres (35  miles) north of the port city.
