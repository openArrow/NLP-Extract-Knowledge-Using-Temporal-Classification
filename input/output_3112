A New Zealand club president has  blamed fertiliser for a record senior rugby defeat.
Nine first-team players were ill when Suburbs lost 169-0 to Marist on  Saturday.
Club president Colin Bell has sought medical advice to discover what  caused the festering sores when players were cut or grazed.
"The medical people should be able to tell us what sort of infection these  guys are getting," he added.
