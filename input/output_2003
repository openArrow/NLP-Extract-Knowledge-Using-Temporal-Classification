A drug baron and former provincial minister  sentenced to life imprisonment, has fled to Afghanistan afer a dramatic escape  from custody, it was reported Thursday.
In April, Ammanullah Kundi slipped out of a hospital in the Dera Ismail  Khan district in the northwestern province, where he had been taken by prison  authorities for treatment.
He then hid in the semi-autonomous tribal belt before crossing the border  into Afghanistan where he is now believed to be in the capital Kabul, the  official Associated Press of Pakistan said.
Kundi was given a life sentence by a special court last year after he was  caught red-handed in the southern port city of Karachi, trying to smuggle a  huge quantity of heroin to Germany.
