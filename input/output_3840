Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev on  Wednesday proposed regular consultations on European and global security  issues as part of Moscow's decision to join NATO's partnership for peace (PFP)  programme.
In a speech to defence ministers from both the NATO countries and the  former Soviet bloc, Pavel suggested the consultations be held regularly  between political leaders, experts or military chiefs, as well as to look at  emergency situations.
Grachev the previous day announced Moscow was no longer setting conditions  to join the PFP, drawing warm praise from US Defence Secretary William Perry  earlier on Wednesday.
Perry said Grachev had given "an excellent presentation" to the NATO  ministers on Tuesday on Russia's new military doctrine to replace the security  blueprint of the defunct Soviet Union.
"It was a truly historic event," he said, adding that it was his fifth  meeting with Grachev. "We've become really close colleagues in resolving  security issues of our two countries," Perry said.
Grachev said Russia was not insisting on special political links with NATO  as the price for signing the PFP, which has already been joined by 16  countries of the old Soviet bloc.
But he said Russia still had a list detailing its requirements for PFP  participation, and still wanted links with NATO outside the partnership.
