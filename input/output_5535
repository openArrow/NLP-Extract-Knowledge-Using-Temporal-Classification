Bernard-Henri Levy, one of a group of French  intellectuals who said they were standing in European elections on a  pro-Bosnian ticket, explained that the list had been withdrawn Monday in order  not to "divide" supporters of the Bosnian cause by casting for votes.
Speaking on French television, Levy denied members of the list, headed by  by professor Leon Schwartzenberg, had performed a volte-face in pulling out of  next month's poll.
"The idea of this list was never to send deputies to the European  Parliament, but to put Bosnia at the heart of the (electoral) debate," Levy  explained. "The battle does not stop on June 12."
Levy stressed the list had not been withdrawn because of any political  pressure, but remarked that, since he and his colleagues had entered the  campaign, they had become embroiled in "a kind of political game."
He said his allies would not make the mistake of believing that those who  supported their list were the only electors behind their stance on Bosnia, as  he recognised there were many people in other political camps who were also  equally "friends of Bosnia."
Earlier, Levy stressed the "Europe starts at Sarajevo" list would continue  to campaign.
The group has resolved to "pursue other forms of action" and set up a  national committee to be known as "Vigilance Sarajevo."
