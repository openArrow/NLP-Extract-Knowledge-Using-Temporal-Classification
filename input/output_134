Indonesia on Friday said it was "happy" after the  wives of the French and Portuguese presidents decided not to attend a  controversial seminar on East Timor, the former Portuguese colony ruled by  Jakarta.
"We received this news with full relief. We are happy," Indonesian foreign  ministry spokesman Irawan Abidin said.
The organisers of the private May 31-June 2 seminar in Manila had  announced that Danielle Mitterrand, a well-known human rights campaigner and  wife of French President Francois Mitterrand, and Maria Barroso Soares, wife  of President Mario Soares of Portugal would attend.
The meeting, attended by non-governmental organisation, intends to focus  on the state of human rights in East Timor, where activists say tens of  thousands have been killed in Indonesia's 18-year rule.
The presence of Mitterrand and Soares threatened a diplomatic scandal,  with Indonesia on Wednesday voicing anger at the Philippines as the choice of  venue, and the Philippines retorting that it had no power to block the meeting.
State Secretary Murdiono said Friday: "We will not send a protest note,  but we are certainly very disappointed with (the holding of) such a  conference."
Irawan denied that Indonesia -- a fast-developing economy and major  purchaser of arms -- had exerted any pressure in Europe to torpedo the  invitations.
"Those two ladies have their own judgement," he said.
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Friday that he would make a statement on  the issue later Monday after meeting a special envoy from Manila, former  foreign minister Raul Manglapus, who is scheduled to arrive here Sunday.
Irawan said: "if that conference was providing jobs, or investment for  East Timor, we would welcome that. But not when it's trying to put Indonesia  in the dock."
