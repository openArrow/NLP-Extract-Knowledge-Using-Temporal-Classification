North Korea's refusal to allow UN inspectors  into its nuclear power sites to ensure weapons-grade plutonium was not being  diverted to military uses was of "great concern," the White House said Tuesday.
White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said President Bill Clinton would be  briefed on the crisis Tuesday at his regular national security briefing.
Experts said that the refueling was stepped up over the weekend and could  be finished by Tuesday. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had said  that if refueling did not conform to their requirements, Pyongyang could  destroy evidence that it was diverting plutonium to make a bomb.
"Obviously the situation is of great concern to us," said Myers. "It is up  to North Korea now to work with the IAEA to make sure that continuity was not  broken."
The UN Security Council issued a statement Monday with China's backing  calling on North Korea to allow full international inspections of its nuclear  facilities.
Myers could not confirm reports out of Seoul that Clinton and South Korean  President Kim Young-Sam had said the dispute over refueling at the Yongbyon  plant without inspectors present had "reached a dangerous point."
