The leader of a dissident Vietnamese Buddhist church  has appealed for his followers to step up their fight against what he termed  Hanoi's repression of religion, according to a statement seen here Friday.
In a message to mark Buddha's birthday, the Venerable Thich Huyen Quang  called on his followers to multiply "their efforts in the struggle for  religious freedom and human rights," said a statement from the Paris-based  International Buddhist Information Bureau.
The appeal, sent clandestinely from central Vietnam, where Quang is  reportedly under house arrest, comes just days before the first anniversary of  clashes between Buddhists and police in the central city of Hue after which  three monks were sentenced to prison terms for "disturbing public order."
Quang has not been recognised as head of the Unified Buddhist Church of  Vietnam (UBVC), and is under house arrest, according to Human Rights  Watch/Asia. The government has denied the charge.
The Buddhist leader appealed for the stepped up campaign for the church's  independence to be carried out "in the spirit of conciliation and  non-violence."
He dismissed attempts by Hanoi to present a more tolerant face towards  religion by allowing the restoration of pagodas and the opening of some  Buddhist schools.
"This does not signify that we have religious freedom," Quang said. "A  concrete proof of this is the fact that the authorities ... continue to ban  the UBCV and prohibit all its religious activities."
In the face of demands for greater religious freedom, "the authorities  have stepped up their repression of the UBCV, harassing and imprisoning  Buddhist dignitaries and followers," Quang said.
Hanoi denies oppressing Buddhism, pointing to the renovation of nearly all  the country's more than 4,000 pagodas in the past three years and the increase  in the number of monks and nuns from 17,000 to more than 20,000.
But to keep control over religion and a lid on potential dissent, Hanoi  insists that all churches belong to the Fatherland Front, a communist party  umbrella group for social organisations.
The UBCV has resisted attempts to force it to join the group, which it says  attempts to control all religious activities, including the appointment of  Buddhist leaders.
The church, which claims to be Vietnam's sole legitimate Buddhist church  and traces its tradition back 2,000 years, has a history of resisting state  control -- most famously during the rule of South Vietnamese President Ngo  Dinh Diem.
Around 70 percent of Vietnam's 70 million people are Buddhists, with large  numbers concentrated in the former imperial capital of Hue, where protests  last year aroused intense anxiety in the government.
On May 24 last year, a group of Buddhist monks blocked traffic for hours  in Hue with a sit-down protest after Tich Tri Tuu, the head of Linh Mu Pagoda,   was taken away by municipal authorities to discuss the self-immolation of a  man at the pagoda three days earlier.
Fearing Tich Tri Tuu was being taken to jail, protestors attacked,  overturned and burned a police vehicle that authorities say was returning the  monk to his pagoda after discussion of the incident.
Earlier this week, a foreign ministry spokesman denied a report from the  Buddhist Information Bureau that the imprisoned monks were on hunger strike at  the Ba Sao reeducation camp south of Hanoi.
But the government did not respond to an appeal by the group to allow  representatives of the United Nations and the International Committee of the  Red Cross to visit the monks.
