Australia has decided against sending troops to  Rwanda until their safety can be reasonably assured, Defence Minister Robert  Ray said Tuesday.
Ray told an upper-house Senate estimates committee that UN progress  towards setting in place preconditions under which Australia would send troops  was "not encouraging".
Australia wanted to see from the UN a proposal for a clear and viable  mission with a set timetable and the creation of a political process to  resolve the situation in Rwanda, he said.
The UN asked Australia to contribute about 300 troops to a peace-keeping  mission, nominating a number of specialist areas, including movement control  officers, engineers, signallers and medical teams.
Ray said Australia was sympathetic to the problems of Rwanda, which has  been ravaged by tribal fighting.
But the deployment of any Australian troops and their security remained a  crucial issue and if Australia sent a 180-member engineering unit, it would  most likely have to be accompanied by a rifle company of about 120 soldiers  for protection.
"If I cannot be assured of their protective security, we don't send them  in," he said.
Aid groups estimate half a million people, mostly Tutsis, have died in the  bloodbath that erupted on April 6.
