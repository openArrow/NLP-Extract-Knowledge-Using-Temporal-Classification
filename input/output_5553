Leaders of the Croat-Moslem federation of  Bosnia-Hercegovina reaffirmed at the opening of parliament Monday their claim  for a 58 percent share of the republic's territory.
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic meanwhile said he was not sure he  would travel to Geneva for talks Thursday with international negotiators who  are attempting to impose a settlement that would give the federation 51  percent of the territory, with 49 percent going to the republic's separatist  Serbs.
Kresimir Zubak, leader of Bosnia's Croat community, said the assembly was  "convinced that the territory of the federation must cover 58 percent of  Bosnia-Hercegovina," including "all the territories where are peoples formed a  majority (prior to the conflict)."
Zubak, nominated by the Croats for the post of president of the federation  for a six-month transition period, told the assembly that "possible  compromises in the name of peace must not in any way modify the basic  principles and the stragetic framework of the federation," particularly with  regard to resources and communications.
Concessions must not "in any circumstances bear on the territories where  genocide has been committed," he said.
Under an accord brokered by US envoys earlier this month in Vienna, the  Croat-Moslem federation claimed 58 percent of Bosnian territory, including  eastern regions where Moslems and Croats formed a substantial majority of the  population before Serb forces effected "ethnic cleansing" in the early stages  of the conflict.
Zubak ruled out concessions in these regions and in other parts of western  Bosnia, along with the Posavina corridor, the strip of territory along  Bosnia's border with Croatia, where Croat or Moslem majorities lived formerly.
