More than 200 Khmer Rouge rebels were killed in  fighting in northwest Cambodia as government forces pushed their way from  Battambang to the rebel base at Pailin, a government official said Thursday.
Between 200 and 250 guerrillas died in the fighting Wednesday. Three  government soldiers were killed and another 27 wounded by land mines as they  advanced down National Route 10, Battambang deputy governor Serey Kosal told  AFP by telephone.
The governor said most of the guerrillas had been found strewn alongside  the highway, killed by artillery fire, and that some 50 others appeared to  have been executed by bullet shots in the back of the head.
He said the 50 dead rebels had been executed by their commander for trying  to retreat as government forces advanced to Phum Svay Sar, 10 kilometers (six  miles) from Treng, which the government said it captured two days ago.
Ammunition and weapons had also been left behind, he added.
No independent confirmation was available.
Serey Kosal said that he would go to the highway Thursday and take  photographs of the Khmer Rouge dead as evidence.
Treng was the government's frontline prior to an offensive that led to the  capture of Pailin in March, one month before it was retaken by the rebels, who  surged forward and pushed government forces back to within 15 kilometers (nine  miles) of Battambang.
