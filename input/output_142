Aid workers have found the bodies of 88 people  massacred in southern Rwanda, a UN spokesman in Kigali said Friday as a battle  for the capital between rebels and government forces raged on.
Abdul Kabia, spokesman of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (MINUAR),  said relief workers found the corpses on Friday in the Butare region, but  could not say who carried out the slaughter.
"We thought that massacres in the Butare region had stoppped, but it seems  they are continuing," Kabia said, reached in the Rwandan capital by telephone  from Nairobi.
