Secretary of State Warren Christopher expressed  "great confidence" Tuesday in the new Italian government as he received  Foreign Minister Antonio Martino for talks in Washington.
Asked to comment on the coalition government including the neo-Fascist  National Alliance, Christopher underlined the "great friendship between our  two nations" and added, "we have a lot of business to do together."
The government headed by Silvio Berlusconi includes his Forza Italy, the  federalist Northern League and the neo-fascist National Alliance, the three  parties which banded together to win the March 27-28 general elections.
Christopher and Martino were expected to discuss Bosnia, trade and other  matters, Christopher said, citing the "importance Italy has on the European  and the world scene."
Martino, who arrived in Washington for two days of talks, said Rome's  foreign policy "will be based on continuity ... Italy will continue to be a  loyal and reliable partner."
In an interview pulished in the Italian daily La Republicca, Martino said  he would seek to have Italy included in the Bosnia "contact group" which  examines coordinated action in the Balkan state.
