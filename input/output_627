Pakistani police said Sunday they had seized 4.6  tonnes of opium and hashish in separate incidents at the weekend.
Some 4,200 kilograms (9,250 pounds) of hashish were found in secret  cavities on the tanker lorry which was intercepted by police late Saturday on  a highway checkpost.
The vehicle, which was coming from the northwestern region bordering  Afghanistan, was stopped at Attock, 80 kilometers (50 miles) west of here.
The driver and his assistant were arrested, police said. The two were  taking the hashish to the southern port city of Karachi for shipment to an  unknown destination.
In a separate raid in the northwestern district of Haripur, police found  400kg (880 pounds) of opium on a truck, arresting one person while the driver  managed to escape.
The Pakistani parliament recently enacted a law that makes serious drug  offences punishable with death.
There have been a series of major hauls this year, but officials privately  admit the anti-narcotic battle depends on catching big operators who use money  and political links to shield themselves.
