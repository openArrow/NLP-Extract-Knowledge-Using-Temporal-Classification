Malawians are intrigued by the question of where  former "president for life" Hastings Kamuzu Banda will live when he moves out  of the government-owned Sanjika Palace after his defeat in elections last week.
Banda took personal pride in the hilltop palace, which was built at a cost  of about a million pounds sterling (about two million dollars) in the 1970s.
He enjoyed showing vistors around the imposing building and its  surrounding gardens, as he did Wednesday when he called senior members of his  Malawi Congress Party (MCP) to bid them farewell.
He told them he would be vacating the palace, but did not say where he  would go or when.
A witness who was present at the meeting said Banda told some of his women  supporters, called "Mbumba," to take a final stroll around the palace since  they might not be able to do so in future.
"He was very jovial while some of his ministers looked gloomy," the  witness said.
He said Banda, who ruled Malawi as a one-party state for three decades,  told them that they should accept that the people had democratically chosen  Bakili Muluzi as president in elections May 17.
Muluzi on Tuesday denied rumours that he had given Banda until the end of  May to vacate the palace.
"I'm not in a hurry to go to Sanjika. Banda can stay there as long as he  wishes," he said.
Muluzi is still living at his private residence in a Blantyre suburb.
Muluzi said a committee would be set up to look into how some of the  country's 13 state residences could be disposed of, saying Malawi was too poor  to maintain them at an annual cost of about 2.5 million dollars.
He has turned one of the new state houses in the capital Lilongwe --  estimated to have cost 18 million dollars -- into the house of parliament.
