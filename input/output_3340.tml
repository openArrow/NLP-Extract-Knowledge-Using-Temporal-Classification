<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><TimeML><TIMEX3 tid="t0" functionInDocument="CREATION_TIME"/>Just as Switzerland <EVENT eid="e1" class="ASPECTUAL" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">began</EVENT> their final preparations  for their first World Cup in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DURATION">28 years</TIMEX3> a sex-scandal <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">engulfed</EVENT> the squad.&#13;
A Swiss newspaper report that manager Roy Hodgson had <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">banned</EVENT> his players  from having sex throughout the <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE">1994</TIMEX3> World Cup finals <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">provoked</EVENT> a storm of  controversy, with no less a personage than Pele <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">joining</EVENT> in the debate.&#13;
The <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION">47-year-old</TIMEX3> English manager, who has since <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">relaxed</EVENT> the ban, was  <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">astounded</EVENT> by the response.&#13;
"It's just a lot of nonsense," he <EVENT eid="e8" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT>. "There is nothing to it at all.  Our players will be with their wives for two weekends before we <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">leave</EVENT> for the  US.&#13;
"Then, like every team, we'll be busy <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">preparing</EVENT> for our first game. It is  amazing to me how much attention this rubbish <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">received</EVENT>."&#13;
But since Hodgson <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">took</EVENT> the lowly Swiss to their first World Cup finals  since <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE">1966</TIMEX3>, his every <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">move</EVENT> and those of his players have been the subject of  attention, even adulation in Switzerland.&#13;
"The team <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE">now</TIMEX3> is incredibly popular, even to the level of hero worship,"  he <EVENT eid="e14" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT>. "It puts pressure on us because we don't <EVENT eid="e15" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="NEG" modality="none">want</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="NEG" modality="none">let</EVENT> people down.  It's like the American basketball Dream Team in the Barcelona Olympics:  Expectations are very high.&#13;
"We're nowhere near the Dream Team in terms of our abilities, but we've  <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">built</EVENT> up people's hopes in the same way."&#13;
The Swiss open against the United States on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE">June 18</TIMEX3> in the Silverdome in  Detroit, Michigan.&#13;
Switzerland <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">played</EVENT> a 1-1 draw with the United States <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX3>.  Since then they have <EVENT eid="e19" class="I_ACTION" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">beaten</EVENT> Mexico 5-1, Hungary 2-1 and Czechoslovakia 3-0.&#13;
Hodgson still <EVENT eid="e20" class="REPORTING" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">says</EVENT> they are underdogs against the Americans and the other  Group A teams, Romania and Colombia.&#13;
As well as <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">facing</EVENT> the hosts in their opener, the Swiss will be <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="FUTURE" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">playing</EVENT> in  the first indoor World Cup match ever, and they will be <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="FUTURE" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">kicking</EVENT> off at 11:30  a.m. to <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">suit</EVENT> US television demands.&#13;
"There are a lot of uncertain factors," Hodgson <EVENT eid="e25" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT>. "<TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DURATION">Nearly 30 years</TIMEX3> of  absence from the top level will be difficult to <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">hide</EVENT>, but we're all <EVENT eid="e27" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">allowed</EVENT> to  <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">dream</EVENT> and we do have a glimmer of hope."&#13;
He also <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">admits</EVENT> that when the team <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">discuss</EVENT> their prospects, they don't <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="NEG" modality="none">rule</EVENT>  out the possibility of <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">reaching</EVENT> the semi-finals, or even the final.&#13;
