The southern Gulf emirate of Abu Dhabi will  halve hotel room prices this summer to attract tourists, an official here said  Tuesday.
The 50-percent cut in more than 15 hotels will apply between June and  September, said Abdullah al-Saadi, deputy manager of the state-run Abu Dhabi  National Hotels Company.
"The decision to slash prices came after detailed studies by tour  officials and operators with the aim of activating tourism," he said.
Saadi said around 5,000 tourists from Arab and other countries had visited  Abu Dhabi, a member of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), over the past four  months and 8,000 more were expected this year.
Most tourists who come to the UAE in summer are from Germany, France,  Switzerland and other Western countries. The main attractions are the beaches  and desert safaris.
Hundreds of thousands of people from Russia and other former Soviet  republics also visit every year to buy tax-free electronics. Airports in Abu  Dhabi, Dubai and other emirates offer large raffle prizes to attract tourists.
