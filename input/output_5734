Italian rugby fullback Massimo Ravazzolo  is a returning home without a playing a match on the Australian tour after a  training mishap.
The 21-year-old, with five international appearances, broke his nose in  two places in a training accident on Monday night.
Team spokesman Allan Forno said a replacement player would be flown to  Australia.
The Italians open their eight-match tour against a Northern Territory  invitation side on Wednesday night.
They have spent two days adjusting to Darwin's tropical climate, and are  cautiously confident about their first encounter.
"We know that all the Australian matches are going to be very tough,  because Australia holds the World Cup, but we are quietly confident," Milan  prop Franco Properzi said.
"It's very hot up here, but tomorrow's match is at night-time, which will  be better."
With three victories in its last four international matches, Italy have  regained the services of captain and flanker Massimo Giovanelli, who had been  sidelined with a knee injury.
Italy have beaten Holland, the Czech Republic - by 104-8 - and Spain in  their past four matches, losing only to Romania.
The Italian side includes two Australian players, former Wallaby breakaway  Julian Gardner and No.8 Mark Giacheri, who now live in Italy.
Italy play the Wallabies in Brisbane on June 18 and Melbourne on June 25.
