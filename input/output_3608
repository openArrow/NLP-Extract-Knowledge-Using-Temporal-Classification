Israeli interrogators trying to obtain  information about missing airman Ron Arad are finding kidnapped guerrilla  leader Mustafa Dirani "a hard nut to crack," deputy army chief of staff  General Amnon Shahak said Tuesday.
Shahak told parliament's foreign affairs and defence committee that they  were trying to garner as much information as they could about Arad, who has  been missing since being shot down over Lebanon in 1986, but so far Dirani  "has only told us what we know already."
Israeli commandos snatched Dirani, a leader of the pro-Iranian Resistance  of the Faithful, from his house in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley in a pre-dawn raid  on Saturday.
"Dirani is a pretty difficult nut to crack because he has carried out  interrogations himself and knows the methods," Shahak said.
"He knows in particular what we can't do to him."
Israel says Arad was captured by Dirani, who may have then sold him to  Iran.
Shahak said Dirani would be questioned for "many days and nights" and they  were being helped by documents and cassettes removed from his house during the  kidnap raid.
Arad is the only one of six Israeli servicemen missing in Lebanon who may  still be alive.
