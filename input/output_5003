New Zealand's batsmen helped take Kiwi  minds of their bowling problems, as they moved on to an impressive 314-3  against Essex here on Saturday before rain stopped play.
The 90 overs included centuries by opener Bryan Young and captain Ken  Rutherford, who had been scathing about his team's innings defeat by Yorkshire  in midweek.
The tourists had started the day with yet more problems in their attack,  when experienced seamer Chris Pringle withdrew after suffering a muscle spasm  in his lower back in the warm-up.
Seamer Simon Doull has already returned home, and strike bowler Danny  Morrison broke down in the first one-day international at Birmingham on May 19  and is certain to miss the Trent Bridge Test, starting on Thursday.
Michael Owens, Doull's replacement, was ruled out of this fixture with a  hip injury.
New Zealand tour manager Mike Sandlant said: "It's too early to assess the  full extent of Pringle's injury.
"He's getting treatment and we'll see how he is in a day or two."
Rutherford will have been grateful for having won the toss. With dark  clouds, occasional rain (which cost 14 overs) and low temperatures, it was  never a day to be in the field.
The captain finished on an unbeaten 111, putting on 191 for the second  wicket with Young, who made 122 before being bowled by Mark Ilott.
Rutherford completed his ton from 145 balls, hitting 10 boundaries, and  played with composure despite the day-long poor light.
Young's innings was spread over four and a quarter hours, but he too timed  the ball excellently and included 17 fours from 222 balls before becoming  Ilott's 26th first-class victim of the summer.
Martin Crowe scored just 10 before hitting out to cover with an airy drive  quite unworthy of him.
