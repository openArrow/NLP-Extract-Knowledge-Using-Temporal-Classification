Copper soared during the week to reach its highest  point for 13 months, lifting above the 2,100-dollar-per-tonne level on  expected increased demand in Europe and the US, and significantly lower stocks.
But other metals on the London Metals Exchange (LME) moved little, except  nickel, which rose strongly after Inco unions voted to allow a strike, if  necessary, at the firm's Sudbury plant in Ontario, Canada.
The precious metals were generally higher, along with Brent crude North  Sea oil which remained above 16 dollars per barrel.
The price of coffee continued to climb, breaking through the key  1,900-dollars-per-barrel level despite some profit taking later.
Cocoa was also in better health, lifting to its highest level since the  end of March. White sugar lifted as news of mass imports by India hit the  market.
Wool reached its highest level since December 1992, after a cut in  Australian production and on stronger demand.
