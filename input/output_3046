Smugglers ignored UN monitors and boldly  lugged jugs of gasoline and kerosene across the Dominican border into Haiti  Sunday, hours after new, tighter UN trade sanctions took effect.
Just before the trade sanctions were imposed at midnight to try to press  the country's military rulers to step aside, army-backed provisional President  Emile Jonassaint ordered the Justice Ministry to prosecute anyone organizing  trips for Haitians trying to flee for the United States.
The military ousted democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand  Aristide in a September 1991 coup. The tighter UN embargo is the latest  diplomatic bid to break Haiti's political deadlock and arrange for Aristide's  return.
The near-total embargo, which excludes food, medicine, cooking fuel and  humanitarian aid, though aimed at the military is expected to put the pinch on  the huge numbers of poor in Haiti.
Thousands will lose jobs as factories here are forced to shut their doors,  unable to sell their output.
Estimates place the number of unemployed due to the sanctions at 200,000,  which first began in 1991 with an embargo imposed by the Organization of  American States. Unemployment now tops 60 percent in Haiti.
Humanitarian and religious groups report more than six thousand people  have died since the earliest sanctions took hold, most notably women, infants,  elderly and the sick.
Port-au-Prince was a hive of activity ahead of the midnight deadline  Saturday as shippers hustled to move out hundreds of containers loaded with  merchandise from orders placed months ago, before the UN deadline for the  military to step down.
The UN Security Council also has banned visas for members of the military  and ordered a freeze on their assets overseas.
And the new sanctions come in addition to a nine-month-old arms and oil     embargo, which smugglers have violated with ease from the neighboring  Dominican Republic.
