Currencies moved little in torpid trading here  Monday because markets in many countries were closed for observance of the  Pentecostal religious holiday.
The dollar closed at 1.6465 marks against 1.6495 at the close Monday.
The price of gold rose to 387.75 dollars an ounce from 384.25 dollars.
At Chemical Bank economist Christian Dunis said that nothing had happened  and that traders were waiting for publication next week of figures for the  German money supply in April.
Experts expected generally that the M3 figure would show a growth rate of  13.4 percent compared to the target set by the Bundesbank for this year of  4.0-6.0 percent.
They feared that a high figure might impede the rate of reduction of  German interest rates.
In March the M3 growth figure had been 15.4 percent compared to the  average figure during the last quarter of last year.
But the dollar firmed against the yen following intervention by the Bank  of Japan on Asian markets during the night. Dealers were also reassured by a  resumption of preliminary trade negotiations between Japan and the United  States in Washington.
The mark was steady at 3.417 French francs against 3.4179 at Friday's  close, but firmed to 965.25 lire from 961.10 following a strong inflation  figure published in Italy showing that prices had risen by 0.4 percent in May  from the figure in April.
Dunis said that the lira was more sensitive than other currencies to  inflation because it had left the exchange rate mechanism of the European  monetary system in September 1992.
The drachma firmed to 149.45 to the mark from 153.35.
