The group Human Rights Watch/Africa criticized the United States Monday  for delaying a vote scheduled for last Friday on a plan to send 5,500 UN  troops to Rwanda.
The US delegation said Friday that it had no instructions from Washington,  "effectively blocking a vote and allowing the slaughter in Rwanda to continue  for at least another three days," the group complained in an open letter to  President Bill Clinton dated Monday.
The Security Council is expected to discuss Rwanda again Monday, but no  vote is expected before Tuesday because the US delegation has asked for  clarifications on several points.
The United States has proposed creating humanitarian zones on the Rwandan  border but Boutros-Ghali has warned that the zones would attract non-refugees  from areas unaffected by the war.
Human Rights Watch/Africa said it was "appalled at the lack of urgency."
"Of course the situation is complex, but much of the current debate serves  no purpose and ... delay costs more lives," the letter said.
