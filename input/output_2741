President Franjo Tudjman issued an ultimatum  Saturday to secessionist Serbs based in the Krajina region to hand back the  area to Croatian control within four months or face the consequences.
Tudjman said in a television address that Croatia was willing to use "all  means" at its disposal to liberate its "occupied territories."
He added Serb efforts to "remove themselves from Croatia" and become "an  integral part of Greater Serbia" were doomed to failure. Breakaway Serbs  currently control around a quarter of Croatian territory.
Tudjman hinted he might refuse to renew the mandate of some 17,000 UN  forces stationed on Croatian territory when it expires in September if Zagreb  has not resumed control of Krajina by then.
"Croatia will do everything ... to reintegrate its occupied territories by  peaceful means," Tudjman said.
"But if that does not come about within the framework of the peacekeepers'  current mandate, Croatia will take all measures to which she has a right as an  internationally-recognised sovereign country to reestablish legal and  constitutional order on every inch of its territory."
He added Croatia could not tolerate a situation where 250,000 Croatians  had been driven from their Krajina homes.
Zagreb and the Krajina Serbs signed a ceasefire accord in March providing  for the withdrawal of combatants, a truce the UN Protection Force said Friday  both sides were observing "almost 100 percent."
But both parties have as yet failed to reach agreement on the progressive  normalisation of economic and political relations.
