US actress Jane Fonda became a Commander of France's  National Order of Arts and Letters on Wednesday, receiving the award in Paris  from French Minister of Culture Jacques Toubon.
Fonda and her husband, Cable News Network head Ted Turner, later lunched  at the ministry, before the couple were received by President Francois  Mitterrand at the Elysee Palace.
Turner did not comment on the meeting with France's head of state, but  Fonda, speaking in French, described the president as "formidable."
On Tuesday, Turner had met French Communications Minister Alain Carignon,  having Monday had a private meeting with Prime Minister Edouard Balladur.
The media tycoon's talks were believed to have centred on European claims  that his TNT and Cartoon channels, which can be seen in Europe, contravene  European audiovisual legislation.
