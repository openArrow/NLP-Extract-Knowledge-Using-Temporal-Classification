Gunmen in a taxi shot dead an Iranian dissident in  an attack north of the Iraqi capital on Sunday, Iran's main armed opposition  group said, blaming Tehran for the killing.
The People's Mujahedeen, in a communique sent from Baghdad, said Seyed  Ahmad Sadr Lahijani, a 35-year-old member of the group, was shot in the head  as he drove his car through Ghalebieh, 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the  capital.
The Iranian embassy in Baghdad was behind the attack, it charged.
