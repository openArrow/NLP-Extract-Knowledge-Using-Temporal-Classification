The US trade deficit fell sharply to 7.46  billion dollars in March, the Commerce Department said Thursday.
The trade gap narrowed by 18.5 percent in March from February's revised  deficit of 9.15 billion dollars.
Analysts had forecast a deficit of 8.3 billion dollars.
The department said a huge jump in US exports, to a record high, helped  offset record imports.
