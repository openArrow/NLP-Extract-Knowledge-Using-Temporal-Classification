France Thursday held out for better terms from  Russia on export of nuclear fuel to the European Union as a condition for  agreeing to a trade deal between the union and Moscow.
The statements by visiting French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe came as he  began a meeting with his Russian counterpart, Andrei Kozyrev.
At an EU foreign ministers meeting Tuesday in Brussels, Juppe managed to  block an EU decision on signing the accord, on grounds that it would favor  Russian exports of cheap uranium to the EU, where France controls 60 percent  of the market.
Juppe insisted that nuclear fuels should be excluded from the accord, at  least until it had won more favourable terms from Moscow.
On Thursday, Kozyrev said here he hoped his talks with Juppe would "knock  down press reports that make France appear as an obstacle to the early  conclusion between Russia and the European Union, mainly because of problems  regarding export of nuclear materials."
Juppe responded that he believed there would be an accord "as soon as  (France) gains non-discriminatory treatment in negotiations" within the EU.
He said he expected a deal before an EU summit scheduled for June 24-25 on  the Greek island of Corfu.
The proposed trade accord would give Russia better access to western  European markets and open up the prospect of a Russia-EU free trade area after  1997 if Moscow implements market reforms.
It also recognises Russia as an economy in transition towards a free  market, rather than state-controlled. This concession translates into better  trade terms.
