Taiwan deputies punched and kicked each other  Tuesday as they fought over whether the National Assembly had a quorum to  debate constitutional reforms.
The assembly has been desperately trying to clean up its act and put an  end to frequent brawls which have marred its legislative image, angered the  public and focussed international media attention on its affairs.
But Tuesday's outbreak occurred after opposition Democratic Progressive  Party (DPP) deputies stormed the podium to halt the proceedings, a review of  constitutional amendments needed for political reforms.
Immediately DPP deputies and ruling Kuomintang (KMT) members began hurling  objects at one another across the chamber, jumped on top of their desks, and  hit out with fists and feet.
The DPP deputies wanted the review session stopped because they claimed it  did not have the required quorum of two thirds. But the KMT argued that only a  quorum of one third of deputies was needed for a first reading.
The 314-member National Assembly has begun a three-month session to review  and amend the constitution aimed at bringing about political reforms,  including direct popular elections for the island's president.
After Tuesday's fracas the assembly was adjourned for the day.
