Croatian President Franjo Tudjman warned world  leaders Saturday against accepting the current territorial division in Bosnia,  and linked settlement of that war with resolution of Zagreb's breakaway Serb  problem.
In a letter to his US counterpart Bill Clinton, Tudjman said that "any  freezing of the present situation and any delay in finding a solution will  only prolong the people's agony and threaten peace in a large part of Europe."
Breakaway Bosnian Serbs control around 70 percent of Bosnia but accounted  for 31 percent of the pre-war population.
A proposed Croat-Moslem federation in Bosnia would be given 51 percent of  the territory under an internationally brokered peace plan, but its leaders  are still holding out for 58 percent of the land. Moslems made up 44 percent  of the prewar population and Croats 17 percent.
Tudjman said finding a solution to the two-year-old Bosnian war was  "inseparable" from ending the "Serb occupation" of a quarter of Croatian  territory in the Krajina region.
"A lasting settlement (of the conflicts in the ex-Yugoslavia) must be  found through a global approach" to the region's problems, he said.
Tudjman expressed his "gratitude" to Clinton for the "major role" played  by the United States in finding "lasting and just solutions" to the Bosnia  war, including the US-brokered Croat-Moslem federation.
He also thanked western nations and Russia for their efforts to "encourage  the Serb party to accept a fair political settlement, and impose if necessary   such a settlement on the forces blocking the peace process."
