Helicopters winched the 21 crew  members of a sinking Taiwanese container vessel to a nearby ship in the  channel Saturday after a collision in thick fog, the French maritime emergency  centre here reported.
The second vessel involved in the collision, the refrigerated vessel  Ariake, was taken under tow by the merchant vessel Aberthauw toward Britain.
The collision between the Ming Fortune, of Taiwan, and the Ariake, which  was variously described as Japanese- and Panamanian-registered, came at 3:30  p.m. (1330 GMT).
Rescue workers at this French channel port said the crew of the Ming  Fortune were put aboard the Maltese-registered Steersman by one French and two  British helicopters, adding that the Taiwanese boat was sinking.
British rescue boats from Newhaven, Hastings and Eastbourne were alerted  after coastguards received distress calls from one of the ships.
It was the fifth such accident in the Channel or North Sea in five years.
