Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Valery Shmarov  requested between six and eight billion dollars Monday to close its  controversial Chernobyl nuclear power plant, double the country's previous  estimates.
Shmariov, quoted by ITAR-TASS agency, said a decision on the closure of  the plant will be taken in July during the Group of Seven meeting in Naples,  Italy.
He also said the Ukraine would need 10 years to shut it down.
Kiev has insisted that it would be impossible to immediately close the  plant because the country has a severe energy crisis.
Shmarov also said Ukraine plans to begin producing its own nuclear fuel  but he did not provide any other specifics.
Kiev currently receives fuel for its five nuclear plants from Russia in  exchange for the dismantling of the nuclear arsenal it inherited from the  Soviet Union.
Military experts from the Group of Seven most industrialized countries  visited Chernobyl earlier this month and called for its shutdown while  promising that members states would provide financial aid for the operation.
Chernobyl was the site of the world's worst civilian nuclear accident on  April 23, 1986, when the number four reactor exploded, releasing a huge  radioactive cloud.
