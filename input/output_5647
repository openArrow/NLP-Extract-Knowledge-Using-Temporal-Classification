Japan Airlines (JAL) Ltd., Tuesday announced a  pre-tax loss of 26.2 billion yen (254 million dollars) in the year to March,  narrowing the previous year's loss of 53.8 billion yen.
The nation's leading airliner said revenue fell five percent to 982.3  billion yen, depressed by price competition on international fights and a  further decline of business travel amid slumps in the Japanese and European  economies.
"Continued recession in the Japanese and western European economies  considerably affected the market," the company said.
"In addition, price competition among airliners became more severe in the  year, affecting demand for international fights," it said.
However, the airline forecast a pre-tax profit of one billion yen in the  current year on revenue of 1.006 trillion yen.
"JAL expects improvements in the Japanese economy in the latter half of  the current financial year, with improvement in airline traffic demand," it  said.
International passenger revenue fell 6.2 percent to 477.8 billion yen,  while international cargo sales fell 10.9 percent to 103.1 billion yen.
Revenue from domestic passenger flights edged down 1.3 percent to 259.1  billion yen, with domestic cargo sales falling 0.3 percent to 19.7 billion yen.
