The number of people arrested for attempting to  illegally cross into the United States from Mexico dropped 16.5 percent after  the government began stepped-up border patrols, officials said Friday.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service said the drop between October  1993 and April 1994 came after the agency beefed up the border patrol as part  of "Operation Hold the Line."
Agency spokeswoman Jane Friday said other factors were the construction of  a fence system and illumination of the border near San Diego, all of which has  had a deterrent effect. Arrests were up in other areas although the figures  were down overall.
A total of 548,820 people were arrested in the October-April period  compared with 657,321 in the same period a year earlier.
Attorney General Janet Reno announced in February a plan to further  increase border patrols and provide other equipment for the service at a cost  of 540 million dollars.
