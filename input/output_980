Jewish settlers shot and  lightly wounded a Palestinian in the Israeli-occupied West Bank town of Hebron  on Monday, the army said.
An army spokesman said the settlers, who were on foot at a crossroads,  fired "in the air" after coming under attack from Palestinian stone-throwers.  There was no immediate Palestinian comment on the incident.
A group of more than 110 international observers were deployed in the town  on May 8 to improve security for the Palestinians, after a settler massacred  30 Moslem worshippers in a Hebron mosque on February 25.
