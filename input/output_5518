By chipping in at the 11th and two-putting the long 12th, the Spaniard was  on terms again, but Els followed with a birdie of his own at the 12th with  another straight after and was in the driving seat once more.
Olazabal had saved a great par there after driving into the trees, his  chip hitting the flag, and then produced a miraculous birdie at the 15th.
From the left-hand rough he struck a two-iron to 20 feet and made the  putt.
Meanwhile Els was three-putting the 14th from 30 feet and so both stood at  15 under.
The issue was always likely to be decided by the two closing par fives and  so it proved.
Olazabal birdied the 17th, chipping to three feet while Els' drive hit the  trees and he only parred.
The pressure on the South African intensified when Olazabal drilled  another two-iron to within 15 feet of the flag at the last and two-putted for  his sixth birdie.
It meant Els had to eagle to force a play-off and there was still a chance  of that when he launched a massive drive.
He needed only a seven-iron for his second shot to the 502-yard hole, but  he came off it and his chip to tie finished two feet from the cup.
Els admitted: "I tried too hard for the eagle. I was a little quick on my  second."
