Machinery orders from Japan's private sector in  March rose 10.3 percent from February for the first rise in two month,  indicating that the downtrend in orders is coming to an end, the Economic  Planning Agency said Tuesday.
Machinery orders are a leading short-term indicator for corporate plant  and equipment investments.
The orders, excluding those for ships and from electric power companies  which tend to fluctuate widely, totalled 946.8 billion yen (nine billion  dollars), reversing a revised 6.3 percent fall in February when orders fell  for the first time in four months.
They were down 0.2 percent from a year earlier for the second year-on-year  drop, the agency said.
An agency official said the March figure indicated that the downtrend in  machinery orders is coming to an end. Orders for the January-March quarter  rose 6.6 percent rise from the previous three month period, he added.
The agency's forecasts for the April-June period, also released Tuesday,  projected a 13 percent drop in private-sector orders. However, the official  said the drop could be a temporary one, adding that "we would like to pay  attention to future movements."
External orders in March totaled 542.4 billion yen, up a sharp 24.2  percent from February and also up 8.8 percent from a year earlier, the agency  said.
In the year to March, private-sector machinery orders fell 9.4 percent  from the previous year to 10,568.4 billion yen, marking the third consecutive  yearly fall, following a 15.9 percent fall a year earlier, it said.
The agency attributed the fall mainly to the result of the downturn in the  steel and auto sector.
