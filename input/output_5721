India will test fire a locally-built  sophisticated surface-to-surface missile, "Prithvi" (Earth), next week, in  defiance of US objections over the weapon, the Press Trust of India (PTI)  reported Tuesday.
The indigenous missile, which has a maximum range of 250 kilometers (156  miles) with a payload of 500-kilograms (1,100-pound), is expected to be tested  for the 13th time between June 4 and 6, defence officials were quoted as  saying.
The United States has strongly objected to the induction of "Prithvi" into  the Indian military, saying it would escalate tension and trigger missile  proliferation in South Asia.
The 13th test was originally scheduled for May 14 but was put off because  of Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's visit to the US, amid charges by  the opposition that New Delhi had bowed to pressures from Washington.
Besides Prithvi, India has tested four other missiles -- the short-range  surface-to-air "Trishul" (Trident), medium-range surface-to-air "Akash" (Sky),  anti-tank "Nag" (Cobra) and intermediate range "Agni" (Fire).
