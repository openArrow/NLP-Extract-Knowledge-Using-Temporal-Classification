The priority of the United Nations in war-ravaged  Rwanda is to reach a ceasefire between rebels and government soldiers before  undertaking any political negotiations, Jacques-Roger Booh Booh, the UN  special representative to Rwanda said here Friday.
"For now, it is difficult to resume political negotiations so long as  there is no ceasefire," Booh Booh said following a meeting with UN Secretary  General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
"A ceasefire is theoretically possible but certain conditions must be  fulfilled" first, he said referring to the Tutsi rebels' refusal to recognize  the transitional government set up following the death of president Juvenal  Habyarimana, a Hutu, who was killed in a suspicious plane crash on April 6.
Hutu killing squads embarked on a bloody rampage through Kigali after the  president's death and the rebels retaliated by sweeping through northern and  eastern Rwanda, seizing control of two-thirds of the small central African  highland nation, and pounding army positions in the capital.
Booh Booh arrived in Paris Thursday from the Rwandan capital of Kigali.
