Congress has approved the final draft of a bill  granting a five-year tax break to the Philippines' ailing mining industry,  Senate sources said Thursday.
Representatives of the Senate and the House of Representatives approved  late Wednesday a compromise version reducing the five percent excise tax on  net smelter returns to two percent for gold and one percent for copper in the  first three years, they said.
The tax will then be gradually increased to 2.5 percent for gold and 1.5  percent for copper for the fourth and fifth years, before the entire five  percent tax is restored in the sixth year.
The draft will be returned to the senate and the lower house for  ratification, after which it will be submitted to President Fidel Ramos to be  signed into law.
The mining industry's share in the Philippines' total export earnings  declined to six percent in 1992 from a high of 26 percent in the 1970s, with  mining firms blaming excessive taxes for the decline.
The Philippines is ranked second behind South Africa in the world in terms  of gold reserves, with four ounces per square kilometre, third in copper and  sixth in chromite.
Senate ways and means committee chairman Ernesto Herrera said the  country's top six gold and copper mining firms incurred an aggregate net loss  of four billion pesos (148.15 million dollars) over the past three years due  to depressed metal prices and rising production costs.
