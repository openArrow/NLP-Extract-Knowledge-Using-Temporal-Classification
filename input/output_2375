The Crimean parliament, defying Kiev,  voted overwhelmingly Friday to adopt a constitution amounting to a declaration  of independence from the Ukraine by the autonomous republic.
The legislature voted massively in favour of re-establishing a 1992  constitution which provided for treaty relations between Crimea and Ukraine.
Crimea, a Russian-speaking territory, is now an autonomous republic within  Ukraine. Kiev views restoring the 1992 constitution as tantamount to a  declaration of independence.
The Black Sea Fleet, shared by Russia and Ukraine, immediately threatened  to intervene.
A statement issued in Sevastopol, the fleet's base, said "it is clear that  the Black Sea fleet cannot remain outside events unfolding around it."
The vote was 69 in favour of the 1992 constitution, with two against and  two abstentions out of the 73 deputies present. Tartar deputies and some  communist deputies refused to take part in the vote as they said it was  illegal.
Viktor Scelmakh, a spokesman for Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, said  that Kravchuk would ask the Ukrainian parliament to decree the Crimean vote as  illegal.
The separatist constitution voted in May 1992 was never applied since the  Crimean parliament amended it under pressure from Ukrainian authorities in  September 1992, toning down separatist elements in the text.
Vyacheslav Lebedev, a spokesman for separatist Crimean President Yuri  Meshkov, said after Friday's vote that "the majority of Crimea's residents  refuse subordination to Kiev."
He said that parliament would name a delegation later in the day which  would travel to Kiev to start negotiations with the Ukrainian authorities,  although he was pessimistic about the outcome. "No compromise is possible," he  said.
