Nobel literature laureate Alexander  Solzhenitsyn arrived in the far eastern Russian port of Vladivostok Friday  after 20 years in exile.
The author of "The Gulag Archipegalo," his epic chronicle of the Soviet  labour camp system, and "A Day In The Life Of Ivan Denisovich," first set foot  in his native Russia earlier in the day during a stopover at the far eastern  city of Magadan, a processing centre for the Soviet-era Siberian labour camps.
Solzhenitsyn is due to stay a few days in Vladivostok before spending  several weeks travelling across Russia to take up residence in a dacha outside  Moscow.
