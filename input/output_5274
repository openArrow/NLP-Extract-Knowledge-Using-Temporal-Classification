Shoichiro Toyoda, the newly elected chairman of  Japan's Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren), called on Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata Monday to accelerate deregulation to boost the economy.
During a meeting at the prime minister's official residence, Toyoda, who  is also the chairman of Toyota Motor Corp., told Hata that "we request the  government to swiftly promote deregulation."
Hata reportedly told Toyoda that the government "has tackled the issue  with strong determination."
Hata also said that if Japan failed to open its markets wider and loosen   deregulation, the yen could appreciate further, which might slow economic  recovery.
Last Friday, Toyoda was elected chairman of the most powerful Japanese  business organisation to replace Gaishi Hiraiwa, an advisor to Tokyo Electric  Power Co., who has served as Keidanren chairman since 1990.
