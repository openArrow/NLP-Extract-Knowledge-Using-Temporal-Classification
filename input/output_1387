NATO warplanes buzzed Tuzla  Tuesday at UN request after Bosnian Serbs shelled the Moslem city's airport,  but the aircraft did not open fire, a UN spokesman said.
UN Protection Force spokesman here Jen Kirk did not specify how many  planes took part in the operation.
He said the planes were called in at 2:00 p.m. (12H00 GMT) after seven  shells hit the airport of the northern Bosnian city while the first plane to  arrive in a month was being unloaded.
No one was injured in the shelling.
