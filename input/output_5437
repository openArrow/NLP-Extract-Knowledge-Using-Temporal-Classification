The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) here Monday welcomed  South Africa to join the grouping of more than 100 nations, following its  first all-race elections last month, the Egyptian news agency MENA reported.
Senior NAM officials raised the South African flag after deciding to  accept its application, MENA said. It will officially become the 109th member  on Tuesday when foreign ministers open a conference.
They also discussed the agenda for the four-day conference in Cairo, at  which the developing states are to discuss the selection of a new NAM chairman  to take over from Indonesia.
The wars in Rwanda, Bosnia and Yemen are also on the agenda.
Egypt has invited Bosnia, Britain, France, Germany and Russia to the  conference, but a Russian request for observer status was turned down. A  similar Serbian call was also likely to be rejected, Egyptian officials said.
