Pope John Paul II celebrated his 74th  birthday in hospital Wednesday at the Gemelli clinic, where he has spent three  weeks recovering from surgery for a broken thighbone.
The pontiff celebrated with a cake and a bottle of Cannellino slightly  sparkling white wine in the company of aides.
The head of the Roman Catholic Church received numerous bouquets of  flowers and presents from well-wishers across the globe, along with thousands  of get-well-soon messages from heads of state and private individuals.
The pope's doctors meanwhile forecast that he would be able to leave  hospital early next week if the results of tests scheduled for Friday were  positive.
This year was the second the pontiff had been forced to spend his birthday  in hospital. The first was in 1981 after Turkish terrorist Ali Agca tried to  assassinate him.
