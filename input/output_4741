England's Nigel Mansell talks like  he drives -- all over the place.
Mansell mixed serious criticisms with jokes here Friday, showing a relaxed  but determined manner two days before his second Indianapolis 500 start.
Mansell questioned the yellow flag which helped foil his bid to win here  last year and kept mum about a possible return to Formula One.
"There's just no comment at all," Mansell said. "We've got to focus on the  most important race in the world. I can't be disturbed and start talking about  things I know nothing about."
But Mansell was anything but focused, joking with reporters about  differences in US and British slang and a busy appearance calendar before he  starts from he third row on Sunday.
"Hell, I'm looking forward to Sunday so I can rest," he said. "By Sunday,  I'll have forgotten how to bloody drive."
Mansell explained his manner as his way of dealing with the challenge of  trying to win the eight million-dollar race.
"It's a way of release when you're under pressure," Mansell said. "If  you're uptight, you won't do your job well. We're professional race drivers.  We can switch on being serious."
He flipped the switch when asked about the caution flag that led to a  restart late in last year's Indy race. Mansell was caught off guard on  unfamiliar restart rules here and fell from first to third, where he finished.
"If that last yellow flag hadn't come out, I would have won the race,"  Mansell said. "Lyn St. James was in the pits and they gave her a yellow flag  and that cost me the race."
