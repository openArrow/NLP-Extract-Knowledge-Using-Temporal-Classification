Iran's state news agency warned Saudi Arabia on  Monday against siding with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in a dispute over  three southern Gulf islands, saying it could lead to war.
The warning from IRNA came a day after Saudi King Fahd called on Iran to  "respect international laws and return" the strategic islands of Abu Musa,  Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb to the UAE.
IRNA did not mention the Tunbs, but said Iran was ready to negotiate with  the UAE to "eliminate any misunderstandings over Abu Musa."
"The dispute has to be resolved through bilateral talks and without any  interference from other countries," it said. "Any territorial claims in the  region could lead to instability like that created by the Persian Gulf War."
It was referring to the 1991 war when US-led troops drove Iraqi forces out  of Kuwait.
The Emirates and Iran had strong political and economic links until the  dormant dispute flared anew in 1992, after two decades, amid accusations that  Tehran had annexed the UAE part of Abu Musa and expelled some Arab residents.
The UAE later went on to claim the entire Abu Musa along with the Tunbs.  But Iran has insisted its sovereignty over the Tunbs is not negotiable, while  offering to discuss its sharing arrangement with the Emirates on Abu Musa.
