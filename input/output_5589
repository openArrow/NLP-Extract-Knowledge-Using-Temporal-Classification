South Korea put its entire armed forces and police  on "heightened" alert Tuesday on the eve of President Kim Young-Sam's  departure for a week-long state visit to Russia, military authorities said.
"All troops have been ordered to heighten vilgilance and intensify  surveillance of North Korea's military movements," a Defense Ministry  spokesman told AFP.
The alert was not linked to any "abnormal" military movement along the  border but to Kim's Russian trip, the spokesman said.
He noted the status of heightened combat readiness had been maintained  since last November, when the standoff over North Korea's nuclear program  began worsening. A similar alert was put into effect in late March when Kim  travelled to Japan and China.
Field commanders from generals to platoon officers were ordered to stay  within reach of military communications networks 24 hours a day, he said.
Police said they would also remain prepared for emergencies during Kim's  absence.
