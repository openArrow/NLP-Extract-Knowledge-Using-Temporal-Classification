More than 300 Palestinian  policemen began crossing into the West Bank from Jordan on Friday as the  Israelis handed over power in Jericho.
The Palestinians are to be in full control of the ancient city by late  Friday if all goes well, ending 27 years of occupation, Israeli and  Palestinian officials said.
The first five buses carrying the ex-soldiers of the Palestine Liberation  Army, who were formerly based in Iraq, crossed the Allenby Bridge at the  border with Jordan and were at the Israeli post on the West Bank side of the  bridge.
Another four buses were expected to follow, said Adel Barahmi, a  Palestinian employee at the border.
Sixty Palestinian officers arrived in Jericho over the last 24 hours and  had begun taking over Israeli installations Friday morning.
The Israelis handed over five buildings, including the central police  station, the post office and administration offices in line with the PLO  autonomy agreement signed in Cairo on May 4.
Twenty of the officers arrived Thursday, and the rest came across in the  early hours of Friday.
Hundreds of Palestians turned out in the streets to celebrate.
