Ramos
MANILA, May 25 (AFP) - Philippine President Fidel Ramos on Wednesday said  he was gladdened by signs that the United States would renew the most-favoured  nation (MFN) status for China, saying it would benefit the whole region.
Reiterating his opposition to linking trade with human rights, Ramos said  there was a danger that stronger countries would impose political  prerequisites on weaker trading partners as a form of protectionism.
"China is now a major trading nation of increasingly important  significance, not just to the United States but to all countries of the  Asia-Pacific region including the Philippines," he said.
"A prosperous China is good for the development of the entire Asia-Pacific  region," he said, noting that Beijing had opened up its economy, "reflecting  that China too, needs its friends abroad for its continued growth and  prosperity."
US President Bill Clinon is to decide by June 3 on whether to extend  China's MFN status. Such an extension was conditional on improvements in human  rights.
