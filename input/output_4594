Britain's premier risk capital group 3i, owned by  several major British banks, on Friday announced a 23.8 percent rise in annual  revenue pre-tax profits at 65.4 million pounds (98.1 million dollars).
Revenue pre-tax profits are separate from gains on the company's  investment portfolio.
The total dividend payout increased by 39.1 percent to 37.6 million  pounds, while net assets increased to 1.85 billion pounds during the year, and  invstment assets rose 11.6 percent to 2.98 billion pounds.
The group also announced that it would float about 40 percent of its  equity on the London Stock Market, in an offer begining on June 22 and ending  on July 6.
Chairman Sir George Russel said the flotation would offer "an opportunity  to invest in a ... highly diversified portfolio of investments in unquoted  businesses without the level of illiquidity and risk normally associated with  direct investments in this sector."
He added that the flotation would allow 3i to apply for investment trust  status which would confer "significant" tax advantages.
The offer would comprise a placing of 75 percent of the offer shares, with  the remaining 25 percent of the offer shares reserved for applications from  the public. The minimum application is expected to be 1,000 pounds.
Barclays and National Westminster together own about 41 percent of shares  in the group, which was created in 1945.
