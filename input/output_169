The move came a day after Chinese authorities released two dissidents but  arrested a third, sending mixed signals to Washington some three weeks ahead  of President Bill Clinton's decision on renewing China's most favoured nation   trade status.
Zhang Ruiyu, a Chinese dissident sentenced to four years' jail in 1991,  was released on parole and dissident intellectual, Yu Haocheng, was given  permission to go to the United States.
But in Shanghai police arrested Yang Zhou, spokesman of the Chinese  Association for Human Rights.
Yang's arrest was the fifth in a month in Shanghai and confirmed  observers' beliefs that the release of some dissidents would not affect the  repression of others ahead of the fifth anniversary of the June 4 Tiananmen  massacre.
Another dissident, Wei Jingsheng, is under police watch in a state-owned  residence in a Beijing suburb, according to family members.
In April, well-known dissident Wang Juntao was allowed to travel to the  United States for medical treatment, after being thrown in prison for  involvement in the 1989 pro-democracy movement.
Wang had been sentenced to 13 years imprisonment, receiving the harshest  penalty given to any leader connected to the movement.
Also Thursday the daughter of Bao Tong, the most senior Chinese official  arrested after the pro-democracy demonstrations, said her father had been  transfered from prison to a Beijing hospital about a month ago.
Bao, 62, an economist and former top aide to disgraced Communist Party  chief Zhao Ziyang, is serving a seven-year sentence imposed in 1992 for  "counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement" and "leaking important state  secrets" during the 1989 demonstrations.
