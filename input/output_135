Australia's teddy-bear like marsupial, the koala,  could become extinct because of the frequency of bush fires and housing  developments, the Australian Koala Foundation said Friday.
The foundation, which has been monitoring the effects of the devastating  January bush fires on koala habitats along the New South Wales coast, warned  their numbers had been severely depleted.
Research had found that in one area considered a koala stronghold, the  Tweed Shire, their numbers had fallen from 1,000 animals per 600 hectares  (1,482 acres), to one koala for every five or 10 hectares (24.7 acres).
"The densities of koalas in the wild are much lower than it was previously  suspected," said Steve Phillips, manager of the Koala Foundation's  Brisbane-based environment division.
"We suspect they will become extinct. They can't handle the impacts we  have imposed on the environment whether roads, houses or fires."
Phillips said major bush fires swept through koala habitats every four or  five years, or twice in a koala's generation, and the animal took between 10  and 15 years to recycle.
It was important to increase awareness of the endangered species, as  Australians would never be able to conquer bush fires, which were a natural  part of the environment, he said.
"Too many people don't think of the consequences when they throw a  cigarette out the window," he said.
