WASHINGTON, May 23 (AFP) - US and Japanese negotiators are likely to  announce an agreement Tuesday to resume deadlocked talks on bilateral trade, a  senior US official said Monday.
"An agreement is likely," said the official, adding "It will probably be  announced in the morning at 9:30 a.m. (1330 GMT)."
The two sides have been holding marathon talks in Washington since  Thursday trying to agree on ground rules for resuming trade negotiations which  collapsed in February.
The main stumbling block has been a disagreement over how to measure  progress in opening Japan's markets and reducing its 60 billion dollar trade  surplus with the United States.
