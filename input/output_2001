Under opposition fire, Japan's foreign minister has  retracted remarks that the nation's pacifist constitution should be "reviewed"  to permit collective security arrangements in light of the North Korean  nuclear crisis, newspapers said Thursday.
Legislators from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Social Democratic  Party (SDP) grilled Koji Kakizawa at a lower house budget committee Wednesday,  temporarily stalling parliamentary deliberation, the Yomiuri, Mainichi and  Nihon Keizai newspapers said.
Kakizawa, speaking about North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development  program, had stressed the need for a debate on national security, but he was  forced to back down, the reports said.
"I will offer my apology and retract" the statement, Kakizawa was quoted  as saying.
Defense Agency Director-General Atsushi Kanda, also attacked at the lower  house committee for remarks similar to Kakizawa's, said: "I said what might  well be better unsaid."
The foreign minister had told reporters that "the time is coming to  review" collective self-defense, which is banned under the post-war  constitution, the Nihon Keizai said.
The biggest national daily, Yomiuri, said, "If the situation in the Korean  Peninsula becomes serious, thorough constitutional debate is inevitable."
But this debate is still seen as "a taboo," the daily said.
