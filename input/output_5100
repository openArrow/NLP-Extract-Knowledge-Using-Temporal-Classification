Eric Cantona added another medal to his groaning  trophy cabinet when he captained France to a 4-1 defeat of Japan to clinch the  three-team Kirin Cup here on Sunday.
"I'm a very happy skipper," the Manchester United player, who helped his  side to an English league and Cup double this season, said.
"We worked well together as a team and kept things simple, which is never  as easy as it sounds," he added.
First half goals from Youri Djorkaeff and Jean-Pierre Papin and two in the  space of two minutes early in the second period from David Ginola guided  France to an easy victory.
Kazuyoshi Miura scored a 78th minute consolation goal for Japan.
The victory vindicated coach Aime Jacquet's decision to reshape his team  after France's traumatic last-minute failure to reach the World Cup finals.
The three scorers worked well in a new-look forward line while Cantona  thrived in a deeper role closer to the one he plays for United.
France beat Australia 1-0 on Thursday in their first match in the  tournament. Australia drew 1-1 with the hosts to finish second on goal  difference.
Result
Japan 1 (Miura 78) France 4 (Djorkaeff 16, Papin 18, Ginola 54, 56)
