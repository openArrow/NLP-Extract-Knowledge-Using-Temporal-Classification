Kim Dae-Jung, South Korea's leading opposition  figure, has proposed that the government hold a referendum on the best method  of unifying the two hostile Koreas, divided since the 1950-53 war.
Kim, whose outspoken comments on the North Korean nuclear dilemma over the  past month have angered the government in Seoul, made the suggestion at a news  conference on his return here from the United States and Canada late Thursday.
"To push talks with North Korea on unification, a national referendum on  what would be the best plan for it needs to be held," journalists at the  conference quoted him as saying.
He said that the referendum should be carried out solely by the government  and with no outside interference, but that freedom to debate the issue should  be guaranteed and the government be prepared to accept the results.
Officials in the government of President Kim Young-Sam, Kim Dae-Jung's  long-time political rival, made no official comment but privately slammed the  suggestion. One official was quoted by the Yonhap news agency as saying, "This  is no time for a national referendum."
Yonhap quoted another high official as saying that Kim Young-Sam was  carrying out the unification policy entrusted to him by the people in the 1992  elections in which he defeated Kim Dae-Jung.
Both the government and the opposition Democratic Party, which Kim  Dae-Jung once headed, have gradualist blueprints for unification of the  prosperous industrialised South and isolated Stalinist North, but they differ  on details.
Kim Dae-Jung, who announced his retirement from active politics when he  lost the 1992 elections, has stressed in interviews and speaking engagements  that the North should not suffer the fate of East Germany.
