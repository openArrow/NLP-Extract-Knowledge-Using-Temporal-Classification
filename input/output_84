Nine alleged bank robbers and two  bystanders were killed when police foiled a bank robbery early Thursday,  leaving bodies strewn along a five-block stretch of road, authorities said.
The bank robbers entered a Banco de Colombia branch and took about 20,000  dollars before they were surprised by police.
Police and the alleged bank robbers exchanged fire, and the nine were shot  and killed as they attempted to flee.
The dead included two passersby: a taxi driver allegedly shot by the bank  robbers as they attempted to steal his vehicle and a bystander, police  spokesmen said.
