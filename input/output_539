Favourites Werder Bremen lifted the German Cup  here on Saturday by beating second division side Rot-Weiss 3-1.
Last year's Bundesliga champions, who finished a disappointing eighth this  season, salvaged their campaign after forging 2-0 clear by the break through  Dietmar Beiersdorfer (17th minute) and Austrian Andreas Herzog (38th).
Kiwi Wynton Rufer sealed the win with a penalty after Rott-Weiss had  pulled a goal back after 50 minutes.
Bremen, the 1992 European Cup Winners' Cup holders, have reached the  German final four times in five years and won the trophy in 1991, 30 years  after their only other triumph.
