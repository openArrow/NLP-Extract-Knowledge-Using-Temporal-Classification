President Hastings Kamuzu Banda, who has ruled  Malawi for the past three decades, conceded defeat in the country's first free  elections in an address on state radio Thursday.
Banda said the leader of the opposition United Democratic Front (UDF),  Bakili Muluzi, was a clear winner of Tuesday's presidential poll.
"I wish him well as he takes the challenging assignment as president of  Malawi," Banda said.
"I wish to assure him that (my) Malawi Congress Party will work with the  UDF government in building a better democratic Malawi."
Speaking calmly, Banda said he would offer Muluzi his full support and  cooperation.
It was time to "bury all political differences and work together for a  united Malawi," he said, calling on his supporters to "accept the defeat  honourably and gracefully."
At the same time he urged UDF supporters to celebrate with sympathy and  understanding, and not with vengeance.
Banda, who ruled Malawi with a dictatorial hand as a one-party state  before conceding multiparty politics under internal and external pressure,  thanked Malawians for "allowing me to be your leader for 31 years."
The outgoing president, believed to be in his 90s, said Malawians had  listened to him when he asked them to uphold what he described as the four  cornerstones of his party -- unity, obedience, loyalty and discipline, saying  these served as pillars of political stability and economic development.
"You listened to me when I appealed for hard work in the fields and to  remain peaceful," he said.
Muluzi was expected to hold a news conference and a victory rally later  Thursday and is due to be sworn in as president on May 21.
Incomplete results of the parliamentary elections held simultaneously on  Tuesday showed that the UDF was also winning the race for seats.
With 70 percent of the vote counted, the UDF was projected to win 42  percent of the vote, ahead of the Malawi Congress Party's 35 percent and 23  percent for the Alliance for Democracy.
