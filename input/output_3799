The Bundesbank injected a net 7.5 billion marks  into the banking circuit Wednesday under a repurchase arrangement at the  marginal rate of 5.20 percent, three hundredths of a point lower than last  week's "repo".
It awarded commercial banks tenders totalling 63.7 billion marks (38.4  billion dollars) under the variable rate 14-day securities repurchase  arrangement, while a previous arrangement for 56.2 billion marks fell due  Wednesday.
The new arrangement was awarded mainly at rates of 5.21-5.22 percent,  against 5.24-5.25 percent the previous Wednesday, with one tenth of the  tenders being awarded at 5.20 percent, the lowest rate accepted.
Commercial banks had requested liquidities totalling 96 billion marks.
The new repo expires June 8.
