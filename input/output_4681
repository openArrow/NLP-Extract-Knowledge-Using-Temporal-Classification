One person was killed when a small Russian  passenger plane crashed at the Berlin-Schoenefeld airport Friday during a test  flight ahead of the Berlin airshow opening this weekend, airshow officials  said.
The plane, a YAK 58 which can carry six passengers, crashed at low  altitude near the exhibition stands as it was preparing to land, the officials  said. The airshow begins Saturday.
Airport police said the dead man was understood to be the Russian pilot.  Another person was hurt.
The YAK 58, which has a rear propeller, is to be shown for the first time  in western Europe and is not on the production lines.
The plane was taking part in a series of test flights to check flight  demonstration security during the show, which plans a daily six hours of  demonstration flights from Saturday until June 5.
Described as one of the five most important international airshows, the  Berlin show specialised in material from eastern Europe and in East-West  cooperation.
