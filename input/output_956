The European Union and Ukraine will sign a  wide-ranging trade, cooperation and partnership agreement next month, an EU  spokesman said during a meeting of EU foreign ministers here Monday.
The meeting also gave general support for proposals that the EU and other  western countries should help pay for new nuclear power stations in Ukraine so  that the dangerous Chernobyl nuclear power plant can be closed down.
The spokesman said Ukraine President Leonid Kravchuk was expected to sign  the partnership accord at the next meeting of the EU's foreign affairs council  in Luxembourg in mid-June.
The accord, initialled by the two sides in March, will give Ukraine  greater access to western European markets for its exports, and a high-level  political dialogue with Brussels.
It stipulates that Ukraine might be able to join a free trade area with  the EU sometime after 1997 if it makes sufficient progress towards a free  market.
The EU ministers agreed that the accord should be signed without delay,  and not used as a lever to make sure that Kiev meets its commitments to get  rid of all nuclear weapons inherited from the old Soviet Union.
The EU has acknowledged that Ukraine, a country roughly the size of France  and formerly known as Russia's breadbasket, is in desperate need of help to  prop up a sharply-declining economy and avoid social breakdown.
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said the partnership accord could  still be used as pressure on Kiev to dismantle all the nuclear weapons, even  after it was signed.
The European Commission outlined its proposal for helping finance the  building of new nuclear power stations in Ukraine to replace the Chernobyl  plant, where the world's worst civilian nuclear accident occurred in 1986.
The proposal is to be discussed at the G-7 summit of industrialised  countries in Naples in July.
The Ukrainian authorities are still using two of Chernobyl's four nuclear  units, on the grounds that Kiev is dependent on the plant for energy. They say  they need three billion dollars to close it down and replace it.
The commission also won general support for a 100 million Ecu (120 billion  dollar) plan to send food to the Ukraine, so that it can be sold and the  proceeds used to bolster the Ukrainian economy.
