Israeli warplanes on Wednesday raided  suspected guerrilla positions in south Lebanon, police said.
The fighter bombers fired missiles at positions within the valley lying  between Kfar Rumman and Suweida, villages facing the central sector of  Israel's "security zone", police said.
The areas fired upon are often used by Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas  to carry out attacks against the security zone, they said.
There were no immediate reports of casualties.
In an earlier report police said the villages themselves had been hit.
Israel's proxy South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia also holds a position in  Suweida.
On Tuesday Israeli warplanes blasted Hezbollah strongholds in the Iqlim  al-Tuffah hills east of the southern port city of Sidon, firing 28 missiles in  seven bombing runs.
An Israeli spokesman in Jerusalem said the planes on Tuesday had attacked  Hezbollah training camps and bases used by the group for anti-Israeli  operations, returning to safety after hitting their targets.
Israeli troops in south Lebanon have been on alert for possible  retaliation after commandos snatched Moslem fundamentalist guerrilla chief  Mustafa Dirani on Saturday from his home in Syrian-controlled eastern Lebanon  to trace missing Israeli airman Ron Arad, whose plane was shot down over south  Lebanon in 1986.
Guerrilla organisations have vowed revenge attacks and Hezbollah's  secretary general Hassan Nasrallah pledged on Tuesday to "make Israel cry"  over Dirani's abduction.
