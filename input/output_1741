South Africa will attend a meeting of the  Non-Aligned Movement for the first time when new Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo  attends a ministerial conference here on May 31, the Egyptian foreign ministry  said Wednesday.
South Africa has been invited to the four-day foreign ministers conference  and would be represented by Nzo, a ministry spokesman added.
South Africa has so far not request to join the NAM.
Nzo will afterward fly to Tunis to attend the Organisation of African  Unity foreign ministers meeting, on June 6, and present a formal admission  request.
The Tunis meeting is due to prepare the 30th OAU summit planned from June  13 to 15 there, which will be attended by new South African President Nelson  Mandela.
South Africa was excluded from the OAU in the past because of apartheid.
