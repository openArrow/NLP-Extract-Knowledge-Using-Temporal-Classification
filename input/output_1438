To help Americans combat rising skin cancer  rates, the National Weather Service is considering adding a sunburn warning to  its temperature and prospective rainfall predications.
Forecasters already give air quality and pollen counts in the summer and  wind-chill warnings in the winter.
But since sunburn has been linked to skin cancer and since thin, high  clouds can fool people into thinking that it is safe to go outdoors, the  National Weather Service is planning a sunburn rating from 1-15 that could go  into effect as early as June or July, said National Weather Service Director  Elbert on Friday.
"It's a serious issue and one which, from a very personal standpoint, I'm  concerned about what we can do to help," said Friday.
Skin cancer is the most frequently diagnosed type of cancer, more than all  other cancer cases combined, according to the Journal of the American Academy  of Dermatology.
