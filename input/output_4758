A group of US lawmakers appealed Friday to the  Justice Department to open a criminal investigation into the tobacco industry,  accusing the cigarette companies of possible fraud and perjury during the  recent congressional hearings into the industry.
Lawmaker Martin Meehan said Friday that confidential industry documents  suggest that the heads of the United States' seven largest tobacco firms may  have perjured themselves when they gave evidence.
He also accused them of conspiracy to obstruct Congress and conspiracy to  defraud the public.
There is "compelling evidence that tobacco companies ... have committed a  series of serious crimes over a period of several decades," claimed Meehan in  a letter sent to Attorney General Janet Reno.
"Failure to hold cigarette companies and their executives fully  accountable for such criminal activities would allow them to continue criminal  activities that ultimately cause massive numbers of premature deaths," he  wrote.
Six other lawmakers signed the letter.
