The British narrowly-defined M0 money supply rose  by 0.2 percent in May from April and by 7.1 percent in May year on year, the  Bank of England announced on Tuesday on the basis of provisional figures.
M0 consists of coins, banknotes and bank deposits with the Bank of  England.
Analysts had expected a month-on-month rise of 0.3 percent and an annual  rise of seven percent. The government's target range for annual M0 growth is  zero to four percent.
The central bank made no change in initial figures it had issued on the  broad-based M4 money supply, up 1.9 percent in April from March and 6.2  percent year on year. M4 growth lies within the government's target range of  three to nine percent a year.
M4 is defined as all bank and building society deposits together with  notes and coins in circulation and certificates of deposits.
