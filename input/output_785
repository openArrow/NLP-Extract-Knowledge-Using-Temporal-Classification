In an attempt to preserve the country's international image, the minister  of defense, Angel Montero Revette, said the government will order a military  clampdown in the capital and the rest of the country if the violence continues.
The government will not permit the country to fall into a state of anarchy  or civil war he vowed.
Tension increased Friday when former commander Hugo Chavez -- leader of a  February 1992 coup attempt against now-dismissed president Carlos Andres Perez  -- accused the military of "cooking up" a coup d'etat.
But Revette denied that the military was conspiring to overthrow the  government.
Venezuela's currency, the bolivar, has devalued 10 percent in the last  five days, despite efforts from the Central Reserve Bank to prop it up.
A general strike by 15,000 workers in the courts system will continue this  week and separate protest marches are expected to be held by street vendors  and journalists in Caracas.
And adding to the pressure on the government, an Amnesty International  team arrived in Caracas late Saturday to check allegations of excesses by  security forces.
Also, a group from the IMF was due to arrive Sunday on a routine  inspection of Venezuela's economy.
