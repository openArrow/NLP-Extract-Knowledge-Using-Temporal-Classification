Ukraine said Saturday it would not use force against  Crimea unless separatists there resort to armed provocation, after telling the  UN and NATO that moves by the republic threaten regional peace and stability.
"We will abstain from using force, unless of course another party launches  armed provokations," Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoli Zlenko told AFP.
On Friday Crimean deupties voted to restore a 1992 constitution, a move  tantamount to a declaration of independence.
Ukrainian lawmakers retaliated late Friday, giving the pro-Russian Crimean  assembly 10 days to reverse its decision and "conform with the laws and  constitution of Ukraine."
"I think we will have enough strength, will and self-restraint to find a  settlement" to the crisis, Zlenko told AFP.
"We will take all the measures based on international law to assure the  territorial integrity of the state," he added.
