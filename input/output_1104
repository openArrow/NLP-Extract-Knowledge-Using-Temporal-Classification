Germany's minister for conservation and  nuclear safety, Klaus Topfer, was elected Monday as president of the UN  commission for sustainable development.
Topfer, who succeeds Malaysian Ambassador Ismail Razali, said in his  inaugural speech that environmental policy also was "peace policy," and  stressed the panel's role was to implement the principles agreed two years ago  at the Rio de Janeiro conference on the environment.
"The economic and social collapse especially in central and eastern Europe  which came in the wake of the end of east-west conflict unleashed an  earthquake, the aftershocks of which are being felt even today in many parts  of the world," Topfer said.
Stabilizing the economies of those countries is essential to achieving  sustainable development internationally, he said.
