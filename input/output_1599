North Korea has decided not to take part in the  Asian Games in Hiroshima this October, the organising committee said Wednesday.
North Korea, absent from major international sporting events for a year,  failed to make the May 5 entry deadline for team events at the regional  Olympics.
The hardline communist state, strapped for cash and isolated amid its  suspected nuclear arms programme, boycotted the 1986 Asian Games held in the  South Korean capital of Seoul.
