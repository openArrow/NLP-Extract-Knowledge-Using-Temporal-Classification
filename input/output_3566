Retail sales in Hong Kong in March rose 17  percent from a year earlier to 15.9 billion Hong Kong dollars (2.06 billion  US), the government said Tuesday.
The increase was due mainly to a 28-percent leap in sales of clothing and  footwear, as well as strong demand for jewelry and consumer durables other  than motor vehicles.
Factoring in inflation, the increase was 11 percent.
The increase over the first three months of the year was 18 percent (12  percent after inflation) compared with the same period in 1993, although a  government statement did not state the dollar figure.
