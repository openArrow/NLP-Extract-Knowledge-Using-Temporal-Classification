French bank Credit Lyonnais intends to make Asia a  priority region for expansion, its president Michel Renault, said here  Saturday.
Renault, who is on a visit to China and Vietnam, said: "We want to develop  the volume of our operations here." The Credit Lyonnais president said his  firm wanted to challenge commercial and merchant banks.
He has already discussed extending Credit Lyonnais's network in China. The  bank has offices in Tianjin, Shanghai and Xiamen and main offices at Beijing,  Shenzhen and Guangdong.
"We are waiting for permission for more, the quicker the better," said  Renault.
Credit Lyonnais is the only foreign bank with Vietnamese offices in Hanoi  and Ho Chi Minh City and on Saturday, Renault met with deputy Prime Minister  Tran Duc Luong and other senior Vietnamese government officials.
"Vietnam has its qualities even if it has been the subject of too much  attention in recent years," he commented.
