Egyptian riot police fired tear-gas at thousands of  lawyers trying to march on to a presidential palace here Tuesday to protest  the death of a jailed colleague allegedly tortured to death last week.
About 6,000 lawyers gathered at the bar association's headquarters in  central Cairo. Riot police intervened with tear-gas as the demonstrators  neared the gates to start their march.
The lawyers, who had assured the protest would be peaceful, were forced  back into the grounds. Most of Egypt's 180,000 lawyers went on strike Sunday.
They are protesting the death of Abdel Hareth Madani on April 27, a day  after he was detained for allegedly acting as a go-between for jailed Moslem  extremists and their contacts abroad.
He was a defence lawyer for Moslem fundamentalist spiritual leader Sheikh  Omar Abdel Rahman and other members of Islamic groups fighting to overthrow  the government.
Last week, the prosecutor general's office issued a preliminary report by  legal medical experts concluding he had been tortured to death. But, the  interior ministry insisted he died of an asthma attack.
The lawyers' association described Madani's death as "premeditated  murder," and the Egyptian Organization of Human Rights also charged he died of  torture.
