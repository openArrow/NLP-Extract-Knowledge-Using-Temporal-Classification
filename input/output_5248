A superb birdie from beneath a tree  lifted Beth Daniel to a one-stroke victory in the Corning Classic women's golf  tournament Sunday, ending the second-longest dry spell of her career.
Daniel, had gone 61 tournaments without a victory, but she broke that  streak with the 28th win of her career.
She had to scramble at the last hole, where she drove left under a tree  and skimmed a four-iron along the ground to the green from nearly 100 yards.  She sank a 12-footer for a three-under 69 and a 10-under-par total of 278.
That birdie put Daniel level with overnight leader Nancy Ramsbottom,  chasing the first victory of her 10-year career.
Moments later Ramsbottom pushed a downhill birdie attempt past the hole at  the 17th. Her three-footer coming back licked the lip of the cup and spun out.
"Basically I hit a horrible putt," Ramsbottom said of the first attempt.  "I didn't feel like I hit the second putt that poorly."
She had a chance to force a playoff at the 18th, but missed the 25-footer.
Ramsbottom carded a 73 to share second on 279 with Stephanie Farwig, who  closed with a 71.
Defending champion Kelly Robbins carded a 67 to join a group of four on  281.
Daniels' ascent of the leaderboard was almost stealthy, as attention  focuses on the duel in the last pairing between Ramsbottom and Farwig.
Ramsbottom had briefly moved to 12-under with birdies at 11 and 12, but  she hit a poor sand shot at the 13th en route to a double bogey. She bogeyed  the 14th, where she hooked a fairway wood.
Ramsbottom, who had never led going into the final round of a tournament  before, said she felt the strain.
"I wasn't as nervous as I thought I'd be, but I had some trouble  breathing," she said. "I just found myself forgetting to breathe sometimes. It  was not so much butterflies in my stomach as being a little tense."
