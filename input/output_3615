Four British passport-holders of Vietnamese  origin, accused of plotting a coup against Sierra Leone's military regime,  went on hunger strike here Tuesday, diplomatic sources said.
The four, Bui Vinh Ly, Bui Hai Ly, Kelvin Chu Kee Law and Nhat Bui Ly,  were arrested in October last year and face trial before the high court here  in September.
They were arrested in a hotel room soon after they arrived in Sierra Leone  last October and accused of mounting a coup plot against the regime of Captain  Valentine Strasser on behalf of sacked vice-president Solomon Saj Musa.
Dismissed in July 1993, Musa has been living in exile in Britain since.
Describing the four detainees as "mercenaries," examining magistrate  Joseph Massalay said on May 13 that after a six-month investigation, he had  enough evidence against them to put them on trial.
