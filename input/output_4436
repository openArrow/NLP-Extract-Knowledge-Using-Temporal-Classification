"In three decades and three wars during this century, Americans have  fought and died in the Asian-Pacific to advance our ideals and our security.  Our destiny demands that we continue to play an active role in this region.
"The actions I have taken today to advance our security, to advance our  prosperity, to advance our ideals, I believe are the important and appropriate  ones. I believe, in other words, this is in the strategic economic and  political interests of both the United States and China, and I am confident  that over the long run this decision will prove to be the correct one."
