A Chinese flotilla was spotted steaming into the Sea  of Japan overnight for the first time since the end of World War II, the  Japanese defence agency said Saturday.
Four Chinese naval ships, including a destroyer and a frigate, were  believed to be on their way to the Russian Far East port of Vladivostok on a  goodwill visit, agency officials said.
Russia's Itar-Tass news agency reported earlier this month that three  Chinese naval ships, led by Chinese northern fleet commander Vice Admiral Wang  Jing, will arrive in Vladivostok on Tuesday.
The visit will reciprocate a port call to the Chinese port of Qingtao by a  fleet of three Russian naval ships in August.
The officials said the Chinese ships included a 3,250-tonne Luda-class  destroyer, a supply ship, a submarine support and rescue ship and a  2,250-tonne frigate.
