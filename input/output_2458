Six youths aged 14 to 19 stand accused  of torturing a 15-year-old mate and painting Nazi symbols and slogans on his  body, the Schwerin prosecutor's office said Friday.
A spokesman said the six enticed the victim into an apartment at Grabow in  Mecklenburg state on Wednesday and beat him up, tried to cut him with blunt  knives and painted swastikas and "Sieg Heil," Nazi salute, on him.
They also gave him electric shocks to the legs and singed his hair during  the two-hour torture session before letting the boy leave. He then reported  the attack to police.
The three elder youths were being held while the three under 16 were  released on bail.
Neither the accused nor their victim, apparently a member of their gang,  gave any explanation for the incident, the spokesman said.
