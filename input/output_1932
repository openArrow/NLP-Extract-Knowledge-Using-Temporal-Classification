A UN flight landed safely at  Tuzla airport Thursday, two days after Bosnian Serb artillery shelled the  airport when another UN plane landed there, UN spokesman Jens Kirk said.
No damage was caused in that incident, but the plane took off abruptly as  the eight shells thudded in.
Captain Kirk, of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), said another plane  would land at the airport Thursday afternoon if no shelling took place.
The mainly Moslem Bosnian army handed over control of the airport to the  UNPROFOR on March 22.
Twenty-two flights carrying equipment for UN forces stationed here landed  at the airport through April 14, but no humanitarian flights have yet arrived.
