The New York Knicks beat Chicago 87-77 Sunday to  oust the three-time defending champions from the National Basketball  Association playoffs.
The Knicks, eliminated by the Bulls in the playoffs for two years running,  were taken to the limit of the seven-game series.
Patrick Ewing, scoreless in the first half, had 18 points and pulled down  17 rebounds for the Knicks while Charles Oakley had 17 points and 20 rebounds.
Scottie Pippen finished with 20 points and 16 rebounds, but made only one  basket in the fourth quarter.
The Bulls' 14 points in the final quarter marked the sixth time in a row  this season at Madison Square Garden that they failed to score 20 points in  the fourth period.
Earlier, the Bulls made New York work. Toni Kukoc had three baskets in a  14-6 second-quarter burst that put Chicago up 33-30, but by halftime the  Knicks had a 38-37 advantage.
In the third Ewing came to life with 13 points, but neither team led by  more than four points in the period.
The Knicks will meet the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals  starting Tuesday in New York.
