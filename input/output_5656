Japan's All Nippon Airways (ANA) Co. Ltd., said  Tuesday pre-tax earnings collapsed 82.1 percent from a year earlier to 2.84  billion yen (27 million dollars) in the year to March.
The nation's major airliner said revenue fell 4.2 percent to 774.8 billion  yen with a net loss of 2.91 billion yen, reversing a net profit of 2.4 billion  yen the previous year.
"The decline in profitability resulted mainly from weak demand in Japan,  which reduced passenger volume on domestic routes," the company said.
It said: "Earnings reflected the growing price-sensitivity among customers  on both domestic and international routes. Profitability suffered especially  from a downturn in business travel."
ANA expects to break even for the current year, which ends March 1995, on  revenue of 807.2 billion yen.
Revenue from international passenger flights fell three percent to 103.9  billion yen, but sales of international cargo businesses gained 3.7 percent to  14 billion yen.
Domestic passenger flight sales were down five percent to 583.3 billion  yen, with revenue from domestic cargo services edging downward 1.5 percent to  26.5 billion yen.
