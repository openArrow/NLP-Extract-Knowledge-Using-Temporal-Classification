Occidental Petroleum said Thursday that the  Vietnamese government had approved its application to drill for oil off  Vietnam, the first such authorisation since the US embargo was lifted earlier  this year.
Occidental holds a 45 percent stake in the 3,260 square kilometer (1,300  square miles) area in the South China Sea and will drill for oil with APN  Petroleum, which holds 55 percent.
The field is in the same geological formation as the Dai Hung field, and  next to the Blue Dragon block acquired by Mobil. Mobil has not yet been  authorized to drill in the area, Occidental said in a statement.
