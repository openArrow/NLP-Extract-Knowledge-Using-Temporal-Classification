Germany's Michael Schumacher stamped his authority  on a free practice session for the Monaco Grand Prix on Saturday, although the  race remains overshadowed by the crash involving Karl Wendlinger.
The Austrian is in a deep coma after Thursday's smash, the latest  nightmare faced by Formula One after the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland  Ratzenberger at the San Marino Grand Prix two weeks ago.
Schumacher has won all three races this season, including San Marino,  which was re-started after Senna crashed. But the death of the Brazilian  triple world champion looks to have ended all interest in this year's title  race.
Hugely talented and driving the best car in the championship, Schumacher  now has no serious rival for the crown.
McLaren-Peugeot and Ferrari are also likely to win races this season, as  could the late Senna's teammate at Williams-Renault, Damon Hill, but there is  little doubt that Benetton-Ford will get the top prize.
Schumacher was nearly half a second faster than Finland's Mika Hakkinen,  at the wheel of the McLaren, as they went through their paces on this  legendary street circuit Saturday morning.
Gerhard Berger, who has done much to mobilise drivers over safety in the  last fortnight, and will be a leading figure in the newly-formed Grand Prix  Drivers Association, set the third best time in a Ferrari.
Hill was fourth, fellow Briton Mark Blundell fifth in the Tyrell-Yamaha  and Berger's French teammate Jean Alesi was sixth fastest.
The last official practice was scheduled later in the day.
