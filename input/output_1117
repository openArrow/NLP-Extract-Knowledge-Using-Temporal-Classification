Eurotunnel is likely to seek about 850 million  pounds (1,275 million dollars) in its forthcoming rights issue, 20 percent  more than the stock market expected, the Financial Times said Tuesday.
The sum would also be far greater than any of the four previous  equity-raising exercises for the newly-opened tunnel linking Britain and  France.
Disclosure of the sharp rise in financing requirements came as Eurotunnel  faced continuing difficulties in raising 700 million pounds (1,050 million  dollars) of new senior bank loans.
Monday's official deadline passed with Eurotunnel still 150 million short  (225 million dollars), largely because Japanese banks have yet to make their  contribution.
Meanwhile, Eurotunnel confirmed it does not expect to pay a dividend to  shareholders until 2003.
The company also published forecasts of its futures revenues and operating  costs which show that over the next decade it will only just be able to  service its total debt -- totalling almost eight billion pounds (12 billion  dollars), if the latest refinancing is concluded, said the paper.
Japanese bankers, who have collectively provided 23 percent of the  company's commercial bank debt, said they had not made their final decisions  on whether to provided new finance.
But one said: "We feel that it's a European project and that European  banks should play a proper role."
European bankers said they continued to hope the new loans would be  provided by existing members of the 200-bank syndicate, who have provided 6.8  billion pounds (10.2 billion pounds) to date.
Eurotunnel said it was continuing to assess how much debt and equity it  needed to raise to provide an "appropriate margin" over its "central case  projection of funding needs".
Bankers said this was a coded statement implying the Eurotunnel board had  decided it needed to raise significantly more equity than originally planned,  said the Financial Times.
