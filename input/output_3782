The United Nations cancelled its two daily flights  to Kigali on Wednesday after the Canadian Hercules C-130 used in the operation  was hit by a bullet in the Rwandan capital on Tuesday, a UN military spokesman  said.
The spokesman said the bullet, which had been fired by a light weapon, had  left a hole in one of the plane's wings.
The incident was not discovered until the plane was inspected on its  arrival back in Nairobi.
The spokesman said the bullet must have been fired either when the plane  was landing at Kigali or taking off.
It was not known when the UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda would resume its  relief flights to Rwanda. The spokesman said the military would be consulting  engineers to decide what needed to be done to make the Hercules safe.
With a shaky truce more or less holding, a UN special envoy flew into  Kigali Tuesday to discuss the deployment of 5,500 troops the United Nations  hopes to muster, in a bid to protect civilians and safeguard relief convoys.
Meanwhile relief workers reported Tuesday that thousands of Rwandans were  fleeing Kigali before the expected rebel takeover of the capital, which they  fear will usher in reprisals for the massacres of Tutsis.
Up to half a million people have been butchered in ethnic bloodletting  since April.
