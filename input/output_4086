A luxury hotel that barred two black workers from  serving Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao agreed Wednesday to pay  70,000 dollars in fines to the state.
The fines stem from a May 16 incident in which the two workers claimed the  management of the Four Seasons Hotel allowed only white workers to serve Rao.
The hotel admitted to blocking the pair, but its management said the hotel  acted in response to a request from Rao's security team.
India's government has denied it made any such request.
The Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination could not confirm the  hotel's claim, but found the hotel did not discriminate on three other  occasions as the workers had alleged.
Robin Brown, general manager of the hotel, offered a public apology Monday  to the workers, each of whom will receive 179 dollars in compensation for lost  tips.
The state will use the 70,000-dollar fine to monitor the hotel and train  Four Seasons managers and workers and other Boston-area employers in fair  employment laws, Commission Chairman Michael Duffy said.
