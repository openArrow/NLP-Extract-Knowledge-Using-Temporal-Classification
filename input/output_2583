The United States and Vietnam agreed Friday to  establish liaison offices as a step toward normalizing relations nearly two  decades after the end of the Vietnam War, the State Department said.
Although no date was set for the opening of the offices, agreement was  reached to make preparations for the opening by Secretary of State Warren  Christopher and Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister Tran Duc Luong, said State  Department spokeswoman Julie Reside.
When President Bill Clinton announced the end to the US trade embargo of  Vietnam on February 3 he said that liaison offices were envisoned, but that a  number of details had to be worked out.
State Department officials said progress was being made on a number of  technical matters, including longstanding property claims by US citizens and  companies.
The two officials also discussed continuing efforts to account for US  servicemen missing from the Vietnam War and Vietnam's record on human rights,  Reside said.
A statement issued by the State Deparmtent said Christopher told Luong  that Washington "wants the relationship with Vietnam to continue moving in a  positive direction (but) he emphasized that that would require continued  progress on POW-MIA issues."
Luong said his goverment will continue to cooperate said the State  Department.
Earlier President Bill Clinton named James Wold, a retired Air Force  general who flew combat missions in Vietnam to head the Pentagon effort to  account for missing servicemen.
