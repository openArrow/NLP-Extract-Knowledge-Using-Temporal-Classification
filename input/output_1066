Israel soldiers and  Palestinian police will stage their first joint patrols on the Gaza Strip from  Saturday, a senior member of the new force told AFP.
The patrols began in Jericho, the other autonomous enclave, last Friday,  as soon as more than 400 men arrived in the West Bank town to take over from  the Israelis.
Under the May 4 agreement to implement self-rule on the Gaza Strip and in  Jericho, joint patrols are made up of one Israeli jeep and one Palestinian  jeep each with four men aboard.
Their mission is to ensure "free, unimpeded and secure movement" on roads  designated important for security, including one through Jericho, part of the  main north-south Gaza axis and three access roads to Israeli settlements on  the Strip.
The senior police official said the Palestinians would have nine jeeps in  Gaza and two in Jericho for the joint patrols. Under the accord, the Israelis  would have the same number.
The new police force began to deploy from last Wednesday as former  soldiers of the Palestine Liberation Army entered Gaza from Egypt. More than  1,500 men have now arrived.
Israeli forces are due to complete their redeployment on the Strip by  Wednesday, leaving the Palestinians to maintain order.
The army is pulling back to three main areas to protect the 4,000 Jewish  settlers who remain in Gaza in accord with the autonomy agreement.
