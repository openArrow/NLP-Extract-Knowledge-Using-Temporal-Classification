Dutch center Rik Smits scored 27  points as Indiana eliminated top seed Atlanta from the National Basketball  Association playoffs with a 98-79 victory here Thursday.
The Pacers captured the NBA best-of-seven quarterfinal series four games  to two and advanced to a semi-final against either New York or three-time  defending champion Chicago. The Knicks lead Chicago 3-2.
Smits made 12 of 16 shots from the field. He scored 11 points in the third  quarter, when Indiana extended their lead from 38-35 at half-time to 72-51  entering the fourth quarter.
The Hawks, which had the best Eastern Conference record, continued a  string of never advancing past the second round of the playoffs in 17 tries  over the past 25 years.
Indiana, the East's fifth seed, had never won a playoff series before this  year. But the Pacers had aleady eliminated Orlando and Atlanta.
Derrick McKey scored six points and Byron Scott added five in a 19-5 run  over the final 4:32 of the third period. Atlanta made only one basket in the  span and missed 6 of 9 free throws.
Smits, shrugging off fouls and triple-team defense, overwhelmed every  combination Atlanta used against him.
Smits led all players with 12 first-half points as the Pacers pulled ahead  38-35 at half-time. He sank 6 of 7 shots in the half, setting off the loudest  cheers of the game with hook shots, baseline jumpers and turnarounds over  outmatched Atlanta center Jon Koncak.
Smits scored six points during a 13-2 Indiana run over 6:26 that moved the  Pacers ahead 32-25 midway through the second quarter.
McKey added 17 points and 10 rebounds while Miller added 18 points. Scott  finished with 14 while Dale Davis had 10 points and 10 rebounds.
Mookie Blaylock led Atlanta with 23 points while Danny Manning added 21  and 10 rebounds.
