Tibet's exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama  arrived here Wednesday for a four-day visit during which he is to meet with  members of parliament and Russian orthodox Patriarch Aleksy II.
No meeting is expected, however, between government officials and the  spiritual leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, who is leading a campaign  against China's occupation of Tibet.
