Football's most celebrated senior citizen, Roger  Milla of Cameroon, looks like achieving his dream of becoming the oldest  player in World Cup history.
The 42-year-old Milla has been listed as both a player and an  administrative director in a preliminary Cameroon squad released on Tuesday.
Under World Cup rules, one player must be cut from the 23-man squad and  even if its Milla, he would still accompany the team to USA '94 and be  available in an emergency.
Milla was one of the stars of the last World Cup in Italy four years ago,  but one of his teammates from that tournament, Jean-Claude Pagal, was involved  in a violent confrontation with Cameroon's French coach Henri Michel at  Charles de Gaulle Airport on Monday.
In a flare-up sparked by his omission from this year's squad, Pagal, who  plays for Martigues in the French first division, punched Michel in the face.
Pagal was one of six members of the Cameroon's 1990 World Cup squad to  miss out this time.
Michel is taking his squad to a mini tournament in the West Indies before  heading for their World Cup preliminary round base in San Francisco.
