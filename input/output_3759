Indian authorities have halted the construction  of two nuclear power projects after a suspected design flaw caused the  collapse of a reactor dome at the Kaiga plant in the southern state of  Karnataka.
A. Gopalakrishnan, chief of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, said in a  statement Tuesday that work on the four nuclear reactors being built in Kaiga  and Rawatbhata in the northern desert state of Rajasthan had been stopped.
He said the move was related to the May 13 collapse of the concrete  reactor dome in Kaiga which left 14 workers injured. Nearly 40 percent of the  130-tonne dome fell down.
A probe has been ordered into the incident, blamed on possible design and  construction flaws. All four nuclear reactors on which work has stopped have  the same design.
The dome's function is to prevent the escape of radiation in case of an  accident.
Gopalakrishnan clarified that the Kaiga project was still under  construction and no nuclear fuel or heavy water had been transferred to the  plant.
"Hence there is no question of any radioactivity release or radiological  impact due to the incident," he said.
But the temporary halt to construction would help authorities review the  dome design and construction methods to correct any flaws, Gopalakrishnan  said, adding similar dome failures had taken place in the United States.
Findings of the probe ordered into the incident will be made available in  two months.
India's seven existing nuclear power plants were closed for inspection in  July 1993 after a fire broke out at the Narora station in northern India.
