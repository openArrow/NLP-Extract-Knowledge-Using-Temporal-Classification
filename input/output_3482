Japan's biggest truckmaker, Hino Motors Co. Ltd.,  said Tuesday its pre-tax profit plunged 33.4 percent to four billion yen (39  million dollars) in the year to March and forecast a modest improvement this  year.
The affiliate of Toyota Motor Corp. said sales dropped 15.3 percent to 535  billion yen in the same period, depressed by lower revenue in most areas  except exports of small and medium-sized trucks and parts for overseas  production.
Hino forecast a slightly higher profit of 4.5 billion yen in the current  year with sales edging up to 540 billion yen.
