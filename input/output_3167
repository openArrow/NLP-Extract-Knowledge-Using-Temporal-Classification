Parliamentary debate on Japan's stalled budget  resumed Monday with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata renewing a pledge to pass the  bills, delayed for almost three months, by the end of June.
Hata, heading the nation's first minority government in 39 years, told the   lower-house budget committee that he would use "all means" to pass the bills  during the current session of parliament, which lasts until June 29.
"I'm responsible for the passage," he said. "I apologize for the delay. I  want to manage it faithfully."
The budget committee has been deadlocked since March 4, with opposition  parties initially refusing to join budget debates until prime minister  Morihiro Hosokawa clarified his role in dubious financial transactions.
Hosokawa has since resigned, paving the way for Hata to form a new cabinet  on April 28 without the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the biggest party in  the previous coalition cabinet.
The delays represent the first time since 1955 that a Japanese government  has failed to conclude budget talks by the end of April.
The bills are nevertheless widely expected to be passed by the end of June  as opposition parties, including the SDP, are concerned about the adverse  impact further delays might have on the prolonged recession.
