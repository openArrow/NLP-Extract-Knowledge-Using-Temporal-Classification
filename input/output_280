The volume of trading and prices were lower in most  sectors of the tanker market compared with the previous week, London brokers  E.A. Gibson said Friday in their weekly review.
Out of the Middle East there was disappointing demand for the Very and  Ultra Large Crude Carriers (VLCC and ULCC, over 200,000 tonnes) business while  prices showed little change.
Events in the Yemen have resulted in higher prices for the 80,000-tonne  carriers out of this region.
In West Africa, rates continued their freefall while the Mediterranean  business suffered again from a lack of interest.
In the Caribbean market, rates were also lower while in the North Sea  owners were just able to maintain last week levels.
In the clean business, there was continued interest for the Middle East  sector but in the Mediterranean demand has been just sufficient to keep rates  stable.
