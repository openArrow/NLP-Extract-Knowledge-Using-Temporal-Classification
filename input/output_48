In a television appearance early Wednesday, Pena Gomez spokes ominously of  plans by top military officers called Operation Scorpio that he declined to  detail.
"I have information that Operation Scorpio expressed judgements that I do  not want to repeat," said Pena Gomez, who has pledged to improve the lot of  the nation's 23,000 soldiers.
Army spokesman said that soldiers would be in their barracks throughout  the weekend unless needed to restore order.
In a four-paragraph statement released Thursday, the military chiefs of  staff said: "The occasion has arisen to emphasize that public order will be  maintained firmly and energetically, in obedience with democratic norms."
The Organization of American States (OAS) has sent a team of 47 observers  for the election.
Also as part of the pact, mediated by Roman Catholic church officials,  parties promised to withdraw offensive campaign advertisements that have  dominated this Caribbean nation's campaign.
But as of midday Thursday they were still being broadcast on television  and radio.
