Marseille played their last first division football before their enforced  relegation to the second division -- part of their punishment for the bribery  charges concerning their league match against Valenciennes last season -- and  came away from Lens 3-2 winners. It left them in second place eight points  behind the champions.
Lens' star forward Roger Boli finished the season as the league's top  joint-scorer with 20 goals alongside Youri Djorkaeff of Monaco and Nicolas  Ouedec of Nantes after he opened the scoring against Marseille after 15  minutes.
Gil Rui-Barros put the visitors level after half-an-hour but Frederic  Meyrieu made sure Lens went into half-time in the lead when he scored in the  42nd minute.
Marseille, determined to finish the season with a win, drove forward in  the second-half and were rewarded with goals from Pascal Fugier (77) and  Anderson (85).
Bottom clubs Toulouse and Angers, already condemned to second division  football next season, had mixed fortunes. Toulouse held Le Havre 1-1 away but  Angers were beaten 2-1 at home by Sochaux.
Nice and Rennes will replace them after winning promotion.
French cup winners Auxerre made the most of Bordeaux's defeat and moved up  into third place, five points behind Marseille, thanks to a 2-1 home win over  Strabourg.
The other Clubs involvbed in the UEFA Cup next season will be Bordeaux and  Nantes.
Auxerre will play in the Cup Winners Cup.
