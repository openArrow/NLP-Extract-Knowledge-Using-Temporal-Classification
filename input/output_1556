"The sales and results for the first quarter of 1994 confirm the positive  trend which began in mid-1993," Volvo managing director Soeren Gyll wrote in a  comment.
"Increased sales and profits in combination with rationalizing effects and  improved capacity efficiency have resulted in a first quarter result that is  on the same level as the first quarter of 1989, despite the fact that the  market for private cars remains 5-10 percent lower," he said.
"Volvo's rationalization program continues at maximum exploitation of the  high demand for Volvo's products. Continuing changes in the production  structure involve improved logistics and increased orders," the press release  said.
Volvo reiterated its intention to focus on the transport business and to  withdraw from all non-transport areas by 1996.
For this purpose, Volvo announced that it will group its non-transport  companies into a new company, AB Fortos, which will "find prosperous solutions  for both Volvo and the involved company", according to the press release.
AB Fortos will be operational by July 1, 1994. The current head of Branded  Consumer Products (BCP), Goeran Linden, will be named president of the new  company.
