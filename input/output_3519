Hongkong Bank of Canada's net profit rose by 53  percent in the first half of its fiscal year, reflecting a recovery from  recession in the Canadian economy, parent HSBC Holdings plc said Tuesday.
Net profit for the six months ended April 30 was 42.268 million Canadian  dollars (30.63 million US), compared with 27.595 million dollars a year  earlier, the Hong Kong-based group said in statement.
Net income per common share -- all of which are held by HSBC Holdings --  was 15 cents, up five cents, and total assets 15.6 billion dollars, an  increase of 25.2 percent.
"These results reflect the continued growth of the Canadian economy and  Hongkong Bank's ability to provide excellent service to our customers from  coast to coast," the Canadian bank's president Bill Dalton said.
Provision for credit losses stood at 15 million dollars, up 4.5 million  dollars, reflecting the growing balance sheet, an HSBC Holdings spokesman said.
Overall, Hongkong Bank of Canada's losses have been running at half the  Canadian banking industry average, the spokesman added.
Hongkong Bank of Canada is the country's biggest foreign-owned chartered  bank. Though its 109 branches compete head-on with bigger Canadian banks for  retail market share, its more lucrative sectors have been trade finance,  treasury operation and mutual funds.
