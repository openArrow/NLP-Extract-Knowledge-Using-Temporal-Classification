Honda's new Indy-car engine proved  uncompetitive during Indianapolis 500 qualifying Saturday, prompting  complaints from drivers using the Japanese-made motors.
"I'm coming back here next year with tried and true," vowed Bobby Rahal,  who along with Mike Groff were the two slowest of 13 qualifiers for the May 29  race.
"I'm not here to trot around at the back. I'm here to win races," Rahal  said.
Groff struggled during a week of practice with engine failures before  qualifying slowest at 218.808 mph (350.092 km/h). Rahal was slightly better  over the four-lap qualifying run on the 2.5-mile (4km) oval, with an average  speed of 220.178 mph (352.284 km/h).
"I was flat out for four laps and it was some of the best speed I have had  all month," Rahal said.
Once the 33-car field is full, racers begin bumping the slowest qualified  cars to make the starting lineup. That makes Rahal and Groff the top targets,  forcing them to concentrate on having backup cars set to requalify instead of  planning for race day.
Honda engineers have examined every failed engine from Indy and said they  have identified problems they could solve in later designs. But that is little  comfort for Groff and Rahal.
"When you are flat out there is not much more you can do," Groff said.  "There was really no more left."
"I'm not pleased with it, but I know they will keep working on it," Rahal  said. "If they are tried and true next year, I will be back with it."
Indy-car series champion Nigel Mansell, who drove Honda-powered cars to a  Formula One crown, said patience is needed while Honda learns from its  mistakes.
"I'm surprised they are as far off here as they appear to be," Mansell  said. "They adapted very quickly in Formula One. They have the capability to  do whatever they want. It's just a matter of priorities and what they want to  do first."
