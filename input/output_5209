After the crash, Mansell leaped out of his cockpit into the waiting arms  of a safety worker. Mansell, apparently on fire, then rolled into the grass,  bringing his hands to his helmet. He was later carried off in an ambulance.
"I was getting burned a bit," he said. "The fumes were coming into the  car."
Peter Jacobs, a crew member of Vitolo's team, said the driver blamed a  slick spot on the track for sending his car into Mansell's car.
"He said he hit some oil and that sent him into Mansell's car," Jacobs  said.
Mansell suffered a concussion but did not remain at the Indianapolis Motor  Speedway hospital long enough for doctors to determine much else. He refused  to be taken to Methodist Hospital for further tests.
"I don't feel great. Apparently I've got a bit of a concussion," Mansell  said. "I upset the medical people. They wanted me to go to the hospital. I'm  going home to Florida. I have a doctor friend there and I'll have him look at  it."
Carl Haas, co-owner of Mansell's race team, drove Mansell off in a golf  cart after his partner, actor Paul Newman, told a crowd at the hospital, "He's  OK. I guess he's pretty angry."
