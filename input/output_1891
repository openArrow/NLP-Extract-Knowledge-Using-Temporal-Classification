A Thai woman was given a death sentence, commuted  to life imprisonment, Thursday for planting an explosive device in a southern  Thai railway station on April 23 that killed three people, local media  reported.
Wanphen Thongthang, 27, had her death sentence commuted because she  pleaded guilty to the charges of premeditated murder, the reports said.
Wanphen confessed to planting a hand grenade at a foodstall on a Nakhon Si  Thammarat railway platform to get revenge against a former lover she was  meeting there.
Speculation initially linked the blast to a series of unsolved explosions  in Thailand's troubled south over the past 18 months, blamed variously on  Moslem separatists or political trouble-makers.
