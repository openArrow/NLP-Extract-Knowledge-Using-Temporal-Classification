Quoting foreign ministry sources, it said President Dzhokar Dudayev's  11-year-old son was hit by glass but his condition was "satisfactory."
It gave no details on the condition of his wife.
Dudayev was unhurt in the car-bomb attack near the breakaway republic's  capital Grozny, but his interior minister, Magomed Eldiyev, his deputy in  charge of criminal affairs, Said Ali Batayev, and their driver were all killed.
Dudayev declared Chechnya's independence in November 1991 but Moscow still  considers the territory an integral part of the Russian Federation.
Talks between Russia and Chechnya resumed in March, but no acccord has  been reached.
Dudayev blamed the attack on forces opposed to a warming of relations  between the republic and Moscow.
