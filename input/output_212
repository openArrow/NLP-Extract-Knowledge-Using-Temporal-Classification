Russian President Boris Yeltsin met here Friday with  German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel to discuss cooperation between Moscow and  the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.
Yeltsin, on the last day of his three-day visit to Germany, then headed to  Stuttgart to meet with a group of businessmen.
Earlier, Kinkel said he was looking forward to his meeting with Yeltsin to  discuss cooperation with the NATO alliance and the Partnership for Peace  Agreement.
"It is an important issue for the Russians and for us as well," Kinkel  said.
Russian membership in the NATO partnership program recently ran into snags  after NATO carried out air strikes in Bosnia last month without consulting  Moscow.
Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said recently that the current  partnership program was not "agreeable to Russia" and added that Moscow would  soon be presenting an alternative plan.
The partnership programs offer former Warsaw Pact countries closer  military cooperation with the alliance but stop short of giving them full  membership.
"The meetings in Bonn have provided an opportunity to go forward with this  question," Dieter Vogel, a German government spokesman, said Friday, adding  that Yeltsin's visit here was positive overall.
Yeltsin was to head back to Moscow later in the afternoon.
