US diplomats said Monday they might be  willing to abandon their opposition to a UN plan to deploy 5,500 UN troops in  Rwanda to protect refugees fleeing genocidal massacres.
Intense negotiations were underway at UN headquarters in New York, where  the United States blocked a vote Friday on the deployment urged by Secretary  General Boutros Boutros-Ghali last week.
The resolution under review calls for a phased redeployment of the  military observers who had been evacuated to Nairobi last month after the  fighting broke out, as well as for sending in some 500 Ghanaian infantry  troops.
The size of the peacekeeping mission to Rwanda was drastically reduced to  some 300 after UN troops were killed in the fighting which broke out five  weeks ago.
The US delegation has been lobbying the United Nations to redeploy the  troops in stages, most importantly placing military observers in Rwanda before  sending peacekeepers in order to evaluate the situation on the ground,  diplomats said.
A vote could come as soon as Monday night on a text, according to  diplomats. The United States has presented nine amendments to the resolution  since it was first circulated Friday.
Several members, particularly France and New Zealand, have stressed the  urgency of the situation and some delegations have shown impatience over the  lengthy delays as the killing and refugee flows continue.
In a statement issued in New York, Human Rights Watch/Africa criticized  the United States Monday for putting off Friday's vote. "Delay costs more  lives," the group said.
The United States has proposed creating humanitarian zones on the Rwandan  border but Boutros-Ghali has warned that the zones would attract non-refugees  from areas unaffected by the war.
