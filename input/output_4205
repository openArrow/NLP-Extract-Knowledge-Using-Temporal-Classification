Belgium's World Cup goalkeeper Michel  Preud'Homme has signed for Portuguese champions Benfica.
The 35-year-old Mechelen keeper said he had joined the Lisbon club for two  years.
"I'd won everything in Belgium. It was time for a new challenge," said  Preud'Homme who was at the Pyrennean resort for altitude training with the  rest of Belgium's World Cup party.
Preud'homme won the first of his 49 caps as a 20-year-old in 1979 but was  overlooked from 1981-87 but has been a permanent fixture ever since.
He won three Belgian leagues titles, two with Standard Liege and one with  Mechelen, the Belgian Cup with Standard and Mechelen and the European Cup  Winner's Cup with Mechelen.
