Arnaldo de Oliviera Sales is to stand down as  chairman of the Commonwealth Games Federation at this year's event because of  Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule.
The head of the Hong Kong Amateur Sports Federation and Olympic Committee  described his decision as "pragmatic."
"On June 30 1997 Hong Kong will leave the Commonwealth and that is a  fact," he told Saturday's Hong Kong Standard newspaper.
The Games in Victoria this August will be Hong Kong's last. It is to send  53 athletes to Canada for the farewell appearance.
Sales won the election to be the Commonwealth Games Federation chairman by  three votes in 1990. He has spent much of the time since then organising the  Victoria event.
Sales could have remained as head of the Games federation until China's  takeover of the territory. But the Standard said most Commonwealth Games  officials wanted someone in charge who would remain active in planning the  1998 event in Kuala Lumpur.
He said he would remain an honorary life vice-president of the federation  but that he would not take an active role in its work.
