More than a hundred prisoners at Chichiri prison  in Blantyre are demanding their unconditional release following an amnesty  declared by newly-installed Malawi President Bakili Muluzi, officials said  Saturday.
Chief prosecutor Andrew Nyirenda said the amnesty announced May 21 was for  political prisoners only but ordinary prisoners were calling for the amnesty  to be extended to them.
"They just want to take advantage of the situation," he said.
"Even thieves are demanding to be released," added a police officer.
Nyirenda said he was shuttling between the prison and the nearby regional  police headquarters in an effort to resolve the problem.
Prison sources said some inmates claimed that when Muluzi was jailed for a  week in April 1992 he had promised to release them if he rose to power.
Muluzi was jailed on the orders of ex-president Hastings Kamuzu Banda on  allegations of theft of funds when he was secretary-general of Banda's Malawi  Congress Party.
The prisoners are demanding Muluzi, who defeated Banda in Malawi's first  multi-party elections on May 17, be informed of their demands.
