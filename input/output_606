Authorities in Ho Chi Minh City are to tighten rules  on foreigners registering with the police as part of a clampdown on foreign  residents in the southern city, according to a report seen here Sunday.
All foreigners, including overseas Vietnamese, with have to register with  the immigration authorities and police, and hotel owners will be responsible  for reporting all guests, the Saigon Giai Phong newspaper said in its Saturday  edition.
The clampdown follows demands by the powerful interior ministry to tighten  control over foreigners in the city, Vietnam's economic centre that has seen a  large rise in residents from overseas in recent years.
The southern city, formerly Saigon, has taken a more relaxed attitude than  other towns towards its foreign residents, many of whom have not previously  registered with the police.
The move is likely to prove unpopular with the city's business community,  that frequently complains about corruption and excessive bureaucracy.
Residents of other cities in Vietnam are required to register themselves  and any guests but the rules are often applied in an arbitrary fashion.
