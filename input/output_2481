Samir Geagea, a Lebanese Christian leader, was  officially implicated on Friday in the deadly bombing of a Maronite church  north of Beirut.
Investigating judge Joseph Freiha issued an arrest warrant against Geagea,  who is already in custody for a separate inquiry into the slaughter of rival  Christian leader Dany Chamoun and his family in October 1990.
Until Friday's warrant, Geagea was only a witness in the investigation  into the bombing of Our Lady of Deliverance Church in the coastal town of Zouk  Mikhail.
Several members of his Lebanese Forces (LF) party including his deputy  Fuad Malek have already been arrested in connection with the February 27  bombing in which 10 people were killed.
Legal sources were unable to give details of the charges on the arrest  warrant.
Geagea, a former warlord in Lebanon's 15 years of conflict, has been in  custody since April 21.
He heads the LF, a militia which turned into a political party at the end  of Lebanon's 1975-1990 war and was outlawed by the government on March 23 for  inciting religious strife.
Geagea and Malek are being held at the defence ministry in a Beirut  suburb, despite protests from their lawyers who had demanded they be  transferred to a normal prison.
If convicted for the church bombing and the murder of Chamoun, Geagea  could face the death penalty.
US Senator Edward Kennedy has written to Lebanon's justice ministry  voicing concern at the government's dissolution of the LF without awaiting the  outcome of the investigations.
