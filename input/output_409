Former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa has agreed  to give testimony about his financial transactions in a bid to reopen debate  in parliament on the budget, it was reported here Saturday.
The Tokyo Shimbun, quoting coalition sources, said Hosokawa agreed to give  evidence after opposition parties still refused to join in the budget debate  until he clarified his role in a loan from a scandal-tainted trucking firm.
Hosokawa reportedly received 100 million yen (950,000 dollar) from Tokyo  Sagawa Kyubin in 1982 for campaign use.
Hosokawa resigned last month after he acknowledged that he illegally paid  no interest on the loan to the firm, which used to have ties with gangsters  and influential politicians, including former Liberal Democratic Party  kingmaker Shin Kanemaru.
Hosokawa is also alleged to have traded stocks under the name of his  father-in-law. But he has denied this.
The ruling coalition, Japan's first minority government in almost four  decades, has pledged to pass the budget bills by the end of June. Budget  debates have been stalled since early March.
