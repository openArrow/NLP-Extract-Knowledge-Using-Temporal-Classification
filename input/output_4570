US oil and gas producer Parker and Parsley  Petroleum Inc. was cleared Friday to proceed with its 295 million Australian  dollar (215 million US) takeover bid of Australia's Bridge Oil.
The New South Wales Supreme Court ruled here that the Texan producer could  present share holders with its offer, provided that it also supplied a  supplementary statement.
Bridge Oil launched legal action to stop the 70-cents-a-share bid because  it said the initial offer document did not comply with the corporations law.
The court ruled Parker and Parsley Petroleum's document was not invalid  but it should issue a statement that 109 million Australian dollars in  unsecured notes issued by Bridge's US subsidiary were repayable on demand if a  change of control occurred.
Bridge Oil informed the Australian Stock Exchange of the provision on  Thursday.
The Texan company's vice president, Herb Williamson, said his firm had  already prepared a single-page supplementary statement, which would be  distributed early next week.
