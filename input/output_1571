Japan's major textile manufacturer Choya Corp. said  Wednesday it plans to set up a joint venture in China with four Japanese and  Chinese companies, including international distribution group Yaohan.
This joint venture would become a base for shirts production and sales in  the Asian markets, an official of Choya Corp. said.
Choya, a general retailer of men's wear, signed an agreement Monday with  Shanghai Garment Corp., Yaohan China Development Corp. Ltd., Itochu Corp., and  Nisshinbo Industries Inc. to launch the company next month with capital of 275  million yen (2.7 million dollars).
Choya will own 40 percent of the capital, Shanghai Garment 20 percent,  Yaohan 20 percent, Itochu 10 percent, and Nisshinbo the remaining 10 percent.
The new company is scheduled to start production of shirts, mainly  permanent press, in May 1995. The target is one million shirts by 1999.
The shirts will be sold to Japanese-owned department stores and Yaohan in  China and Hong Kong, as well as being exported to Japan.
