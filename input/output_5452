Violence flared up across South Africa this  weekend for the first time since last month's elections, claiming 43 lives  countrywide, police said Monday.
Most of the killings were due to the so-called "Taxi War" -- battle for  control of ranks and clientele in the large black townships -- as well as to  common crimes, rather than political killings, police said.
Ten people died in taxi-wars in Johannesburg and near Pretoria, they said.
A total 28 were killed in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, a traditional  scene of conflict between ANC and Zulu Inkatha supporters.
North of Durban, a score of men armed with automatic weapons gunned down  four people and spread terror Saturday across a sugar-cane plantation.
Political violence, which has claimed thousands of lives in South Africa,  has abated since last month's first all-race general elections brought the  African National Congress (ANC) to power.
The Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party won control of its traditional  stronghold in KwaZulu-Natal.
