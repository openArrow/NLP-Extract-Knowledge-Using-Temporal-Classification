A juvenile court Thursday cleared a Malaysian  teenager of vandalism and mischief charges but fined him for keeing stolen  property.
The 15-year-old, who cannot be named under Singapore law because of his  age, was the last of five foreign students, including caned US teenager  Michael Fay, to appear in court on charges of spray-painting cars.
After the sentencing, deputy public prosecutor Ng Cheng Thiam told the  court that he was dropping two vandalism and two mischief charges against the  boy.
Magistrate Tan Choon Kiat fined the youth 600 Singapore dollars (392 US)  for possessing four Mercedes Benz emblems believed to have been stolen.
The Malaysian will also forfeit a deposit of 2,000 dollars if he commits  any offence during the next 12 months.
"You have to step up supervision and monitor him closely," Tan told the  boy's parents standing before him.
The Malaysian, Fay, American Stephen Freehill, Hong Kong national Shiu Chi  Ho, and another Malaysian, who also cannot be identified because of his age,  were among students arrested last October.
Fay received four lashes of the cane three weeks ago and is serving four  months in jail while Shiu, sentenced to eight months in jail and 12 strokes of  the cane, has appealed to President Ong Teng Cheong for clemency.
Fay's original court-ordered six lashes, were reduced to four after  President Bill Clinton appealed to Singapore to spare the rod. Singapore's  decision to proceed with the caning was, however, severely criticised by the  US government.
