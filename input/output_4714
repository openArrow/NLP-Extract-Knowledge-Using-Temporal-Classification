At least three Canadians have been victims in the  past few days of the flesh-eating bug that has killed at least 15 people  across Britain in the past year, newspapers reported Friday.
La Presse newspaper in Montreal said a 32-year-old woman was in critical  condition in a hospital in Gatineau, near Ottawa, while two other victims had  been hospitalized in Toronto.
In the Gatineau case, said the newspaper, doctors were considering  amputation to arrest the spread of the streptoccus-A bacterium.
Public health authorities in the Outaouais region of Quebec, which  includes Gatineau, said some six or seven such cases were diagnosed every year  in the province of Quebec.
The bacterium often causes nothing worse than a sore throat.
But, when altered by a virus, it releases toxins that attack body tissue  with a virulent gangrene-like infection.
