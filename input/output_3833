President-elect Roman Herzog has called  for a "head-on fight" against the extreme right in Germany by the organs of  the state, in an interview to appear Thursday.
"It is above all a question of the police and legal authorities," Herzog  who is currently chief judge of the constitutional court and was chosen Monday  as the next head of state, told the weekly Die Woche.
Asked whether he believed extreme right parties and groups should be  outlawed, he replied: "Yes, when the facts are such that one can be sure of  upholding the case in the courts."
Herzog said he could not imagine neo-Nazi theories flourishing in Germany.  "What worries me much more is that the crypto-Nazis, the old incorrigibles,  should find an appeal and imitators among the younger generation."
Herzog, who takes office July 1, was criticised for not having dealt with  the problem of mounting extreme right-wing violence in Germany in his  acceptance speech Monday evening following his election.
In the Die Woche interview, the president-elect called for determined  resistance against any development on the lines of that in Italy to bring  neo-fascist parties into government.
He saw no immediate danger of this, but said "the highest vigilance" was  demanded.
Herzog spoke out against the revival of German nationalist ideas, which he  believed could "no longer be a driving force for our people" today and which  struck no chord in him personally.
He also dismissed the idea that the reunited Germany need no longer feel  concerned about its Nazi past.
Herzog did "not feel emphasis should primarily be laid upon past  responsibility, but on that which we can learn for the future", which for him  meant "a particular need to develop barriers against totalitarianism".
"We must be ready in the future to draw conclusions from the atrocities of  the extermination of the Jews and other minorities. I can for that reason  absolutely not adopt this notion that the post-war period has ended," he said.
