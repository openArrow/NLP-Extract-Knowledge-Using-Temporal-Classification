Argentina would request Margaret  Thatcher's extradition if the Falklands War sinking of an Argentine ship is  determined to have been a war crime, President Carlos Menem said Monday.
The Argentine navy has said the cruiser General Belgrano was outside the  war zone, and not engaged in combat, when it was hit by a torpedo fired by the  British submarine Conquerer during the 74-day war over the South Atlantic  islands in 1982.
The May 2, 1982 attack on the islands known here as the Malvinas claimed  the lives of 323 Argentine sailors of the ship's crew of 1,030.
"If it really was a war crime, with all due respect, we would have to ask  for (former British prime minister) Margaret Thatcher's extradition," the  Argentine president said after opening a regional computer industry conference  in this Andean resort town.
