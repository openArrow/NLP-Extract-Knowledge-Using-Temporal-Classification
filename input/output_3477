In Kiev, Crimean parliamentary speaker Sergei Tsekov began talks with his  Ukrainian counterpart Alexander Moroz on Crimean demands for a separate  citizenship and for integration in the Russian ruble zone.
The talks came after British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, in meetings  with his Russian counterpart Andrei Kozyrev here, said that Russia did not  plan to intervene to support Crimea's drive for secession from Ukraine.
The republic was part of Russia up until 1954 when Soviet leader Nikita  Khrushchev gave Crimea to Ukraine as a "gift" celebrating the friendship  between the two Slav peoples.
Britain, Germany and the United States back Ukraine in its row with the  secessionist republic and have reiterated that Crimea remains an integral part  of Ukraine.
Tension has remained high in the main Crimean city of Simferopol after  Ukraine moved about 25 armored personnel carriers in the region over the  weekend.
