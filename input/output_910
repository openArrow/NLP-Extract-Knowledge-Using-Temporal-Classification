Around 9,000 miners returned to work Monday  at South Africa's Kloof gold mine near Carletonville, 50 kilometres (30 miles)  west of here, mine owners Gold Fields said.
The workers, who staged an 11-day strike to protest against the dismissal  of a union activist, decided to return to work after a meeting Sunday  addressed by National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) president J Motlatsi.
Gold Fields said Sunday in a statement that the miners had agreed to seek  "alternative means" to sort out their grievance and that the first batch would  return to work on the Sunday night shift.
The mine dismissed NUM branch chairman Jackson Mafika after a disciplinary  inquiry found that he had threatened fellow employees for not taking part in a  strike in March.
The strikers Thursday defied a court order declaring the strike unlawful  and ordering them back to work.
Gold Fields late last week estimated production losses during the strike  at around 25 million rands (6.9 million dollars).
