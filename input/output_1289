Prices in Vietnam rose 0.3 percent in April, lifting  the inflation rate since the start of the year to 5.4 percent against 2.9  percent for the first four months of 1993, according to official figures  published Tuesday.
The April performance, coming after a significant rise in the first  quarter, will help the government meet its objective of single-figure  inflation for calendar 1994.
Vietnam registered an historical low rate of 5.2 percent at the end of  last year, dipping below 10 percent for the first time since the launch of  economic reforms in 1987, falling from 67.5 percent in 1991 and 17 percent in  1992.
Officials said prices should remain stable for the rest of the year after  the traditional spending splurge during Tet celebrations of the Lunar New Year  in February, aided by a record rice harvest.
The statistics department said industrial output grew 12.1 percent in the  first four months over the same period last year, with exports up 17 percent.
