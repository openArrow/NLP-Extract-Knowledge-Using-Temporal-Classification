Argentinan Eduardo Romero snatched his fifth European  Tour title victory when he sank a six-foot putt on the final green to take the  Italian Open title away from New Zealander Greg Turner here on Sunday.
The 39-year-old from Cordoba, whose father, brother and two uncles are all  professionals, shot a final round of 67 in the scorching sunshine on the Marco  Simone course for a 16 under par total of 272.
It was the slenderest of wins over the 31-year-old from Dunedin, who  blazed to a final round 65 in a brilliant defence of the title he won in  Modena last season.
But he was deprived of that honour when Romero kept his nerve on a tense  finishing hole to secure the par four he needed.
It was Romero's first win since he took the Spanish and French Opens in  1991 and has arrived after a brave decision to change his swing in the latter  part of his career.
His fathter Edurardo, who has been head professional at the Cordoba club  for 35 years, convinced him his swing had become too flat and he needed to be  more upright.
"He has been waiting for news of this win," said Romero. "I decided at the  start of the year that a new year would mean a new swing and a new life for me.
"And that is how it has happened. But I was very nervous because I had not  won for over two years and I could not sleep last night as the thought of it  all."
