<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><TimeML><TIMEX3 tid="t0" functionInDocument="CREATION_TIME"/>Jens Reich is the joker among the four candidates --  a serious political challenger, while being a rank outsider.&#13;
Without the backing of one of the three main parties of government as the  others have, he has no chance at all of being <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">elected</EVENT>.&#13;
But Reich <EVENT eid="e2" class="REPORTING" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">says</EVENT> his very political independence <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">gives</EVENT> his candidacy  strength, as the president should be <EVENT eid="e4" class="STATE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="should">independent</EVENT>.&#13;
Reich, 55, was a leading figure in the groundswell of popular opposition  in East Germany that <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">brought</EVENT> the Berlin Wall <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">crashing</EVENT> down in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE">1989</TIMEX3>. Since then  he has <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">championed</EVENT> the cause of equality among Germans, east and west.&#13;
A professor of molecular biology, he has the support of the  Alliance-90/Greens party, of independent intellectuals, and of the rebellious  leftwingers of the SPD's youthwing.&#13;
Reich was a deputy of the New Forum movement in the short-lived first  freely-elected parliament for East Germany in the period just before  reunification, from March to December 1990.&#13;
