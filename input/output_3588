The dollar rose against the major currencies  except the yen Tuesday in calm trading dominated by technical factors and  expectations of a resumption of US-Japan trade talks.
The ounce of gold fell a dollar to 388.60 dollars from Monday's close.
Around 9:50 a.m. (1330 GMT), the dollar traded at 1.6485 German marks  against 1.6430 Monday and 104.29 yen against 104.25 yen. Earlier in London,  the dollar traded at 1.6495 marks and 104.17 yen.
Against the other major currencies, the dollar also rose, trading at  5.6385 French francs against 5.6235 Monday, at 1.4085 Swiss francs against  1.4055, and at 0.6643 pounds sterling against 0.6636.
Dealers were awaiting an official announcement on the resumption of  US-Japan trade talks, but it was not expected to have a big impact on the  trade talks, said Benoit Jadoul, a vice president at Chase Manhattan.
The dollar could rise to 104.50 yen but a sell-off should ensue at that  level, said Jadoul, who expected the US currency to move within a range of  1.6380 marks and 1.6500.
