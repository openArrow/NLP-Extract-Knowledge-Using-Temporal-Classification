The Supreme Court began proceedings May 20 against the three, who were  accused of withdrawing money from the interior fund, converting it into  dollars and then keeping difference when the Venezuelan bolivar was  subsequently devalued.
Perez has insisted the funds were used for national security purposes that  he cannot disclose and his lawyers say it is up to the court to prove that the  money was misappropriated.
Defense Attorney Rafael Perez Perdomo dismissed reports that Perez used  the funds -- which were accessed in 1989 -- for "Operation Orchid" to provide  Venezuelan bodyguards to Violeta Chamorro, who was elected president of  Nicaragua in 1990.
Justice Hildegard de Sanso, who voted against opening the trial, said she  would not rule out the possibility Chamorro could be called to testify.
"If some elements of evidence surface during the trial, (Chamorro) could  be incriminated as the recipient of the funds Perez is being tried for" using,  de Sanso said.
The 11-4 court ruling clears the way for a formal trial against Perez and  his aides, which could take as long as 12 months, experts said.
Izaguirre was jailed along with Perez. The former president is entitled to  house arrest because he is more than 70 years old, but he is not requesting it.
Interior Minister Ramon Escovar, who brought the initial charges against  Perez when he served as attorney general, said the Supreme Court's order  demonstrated that Venezuela was sincere about rooting out corruption.
"This is not an act of hostility or revenge, but a judicial move with all  the form and substance of the law," he said.
Arrest warrants were issued for two other officials charged in the case,  Carlos Vera Aristigueta and Oscar Barreto.
