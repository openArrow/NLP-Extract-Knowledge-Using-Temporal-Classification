The changing of the guard at Roland Garros continued  at the French Open here on Friday when two more members of the establishment  crashed out to talented newcomers.
Mary Joe Fernandez, last year's finalist and seeded tenth, thought she was  having a nightmare when she was frogmarched out of the event by Romania's  20-year-old Irina Spirlea.
"She reminds me a bit of Steffi Graf," gasped the American after her  70-minute 4-6, 1-6 humiliation on an overcast centre-court.
"She likes to run round her backhand and hit forehands and she is a very,  very good athlete."
Meanwhile experienced 29-year-old Helena Sukova also made a third-round  exit when she went down to Ines Gorrochategui -- a girl nine years her junior  who is being hailed as the new Gabriela Sabatini.
The talented Argentinian, who has grown in stature since beating Martina  Navratilova at Hilton Head earlier this year, ended Sukova's dreams of success  in her 46th Grand Slam tournament, by scoring an exciting 7-6 (10/8), 7-6  (7/1) victory.
So far eight women's seeds have failed to survive the first week.
Gorrochategui, currently ranked 36th in the world and a finalist at  Auckland earlier this year, now plays German qualifier Karin Scwendt or  21st-ranked Croatian teenager Iva Majoli for a place in the quarter-finals.
Spirlea faces either defending champion Steffi Graf or South African  Joanetta Kruger.
