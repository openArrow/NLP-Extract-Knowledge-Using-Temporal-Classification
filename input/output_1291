The Cannes film festival on Tuesday  premiered a film which put sex right in the front seat.
"Le Buttane" (The Prostitutes), a late entry to the official competition  from Italian director Aurelio Grimaldi, tells the straightforward story of the  exploits of a group of prostitutes in Sicily.
Shot in black and white, the movie pulls no punches in its depiction of  their lives, and with the violence, corruption and sheer boredom which  accompanies their daily toil.
Grimaldi, a writer-turned director, concedes that he has no high  expectations for his 85-minute movie.
"We never thought we would participate in such a prestigious festival as  Cannes. We are very happy about it and a little intimidated. It took me a few  weeks to make this small film.
"It certainly is not a 'rich' film, but maybe for that reason does not  make inappropriate and risky suggestions."
The film was only selected for the main competition at the last minute. It  missed the official deadline for entries, but Grimaldi managed to persuade  festival director Gilles Jacob to view it.
Sex has not been entirely absent from other films already shown in the  main competition, which culminated next Monday in the presentation of the  Golden Palm to one of the 23 films in competing.
The French favourite, "La Reine Margot" by Patrice Chereau and starring  Isabelle Adjani, did not shy away from depicting the voracious sexual appetite  of Marguerite of Valois during the 16th century religious wars.
Another movie on sexual obsession was Canadian Atom Egoyan's "Exotica," a  fetishistic psychological drama set largely in a strip-tease club.
