Four gunmen who hijacked a bus and took its  passengers captive flew out of the southern Russian town of Mineralnye Vody  Friday aboard a helicopter with a ransom of eight million dollars and four  hostages, police said.
Police general Ivan Tetereviatnikov said the gunmen had earlier been given  arms and morphine to release some passengers Thursday afternoon, then two lots  of four million dollars Friday in exchange for the freedom of two more batches  of passengers.
He told AFP by telephone that the helicopter, which had a crew of four,  was flying "toward the east" with the hostages, three women and one man.
The gunmen, armed with three submachine-guns and a grenade, had holed up  with their hostages -- 51 originally -- in the bus station at the Mineralnye  Vody airport, Tetereviatnikov said.
The gunmen freed a first group of hostages Thursday afternoon in return  for arms, drugs and equipment, retaining 13 of the passengers.
The security forces handed over four more sub-machineguns, a grenade  launcher, four bullet-proof vests, night-sights and a portable television set  to the men, an interior ministry source said.
Police had previously also provided the gunmen with phials of morphine,  security forces said.
The arms had been "prepared" by the interior ministry but the bullet-proof  vests were real, the source said. Television news broadcasts were being  "filtered."
