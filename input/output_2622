Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher could at the age of 73 be  dismissed as an elderly albeit elegant woman, but her years are marked by an  iron-willed spirit and independence.
Far from being content with her ready-made role as "Grand Lady of the  Liberals", this former junior foreign minister is one of the thinkers of the  Free Democrat Party (FDP).
A heavy-weight orator to her friends, her detractors regard her as a red  peril. She has irked party colleagues by demanding a reform of parliament or,  in the early 198Os, by opposing an alliance with the Christian Democrats.
Hamm-Bruecher was wheeled out of political semi-retirement by the Free  Democrats when they balked at supporting the Christian Union parties'  ultra-conservative Steffen Heitmann, and they have backed her since.
Born May 11 1921 at Essen, she was brought up in Dresden and studied  chemistry in Munich during the war years, when she was an active member of the  anti-Nazi resistance.
Under no illusion about being elected, Hamm-Bruecher says that a woman  candidate for the presidency is an important fact in itself. To be president  would for her be "a way of being useful to our democracy".
