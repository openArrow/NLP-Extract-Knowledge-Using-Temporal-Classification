Suspected Moslem militants shot dead a  policeman Sunday in the troubled Asyut region of Upper Egypt, police said.
Two gunmen opened fire on a taxi carrying policeman Mohamed Ahmed Goweid  in the village of Sedfa. They then fled the scene, making off with the  policeman's gun.
Three policemen were shot dead Friday in separate incidents in southern  Egypt. A fourth was also wounded.
The outlawed Jamaa Islamiyya (Islamic Group) later said it carried out an   attack on a police station in Badari, some 400 kilometers (240 miles) south of  Cairo, in which two of the policemen were killed.
It said its militants also shot dead a third policeman a few hours later  as he left home in nearby Abu Tig.
A statement sent to AFP from the group's armed wing said Friday's two  attacks were "part of a series planned to avenge the murder" on April 25 of  Talaat Yassin Hammam, the organisation's military leader.
The armed group has adopted the name Talaat Yassin to honour Hammam, who  was shot dead in a police raid on his home.
The interior ministry said Saturday 98 suspected militants had been  arrested in Cairo, Ismailia on the Suez Canal, and in the Nile Delta and Upper  Egypt, following intelligence gathered after Hammam's death.
It said it had also seized about 80,000 dollars and a large quantity of  arms, ammunition and explosives.
It said several leaders of armed operations had been arrested as well as  those in charge of finances and communications.
