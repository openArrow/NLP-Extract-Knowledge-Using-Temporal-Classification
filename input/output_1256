The first of six prototypes of Japan's  next-generation FSX fighter is expected to fly next year, but the aircraft's  future remains in doubt because of the end of the cold war and changing  strategic requirements in Asia.
The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper reported Tuesday that the development of the  fighter, equipped with sophisticated ship-targetting equipment and navigation  electronics, had "passed a critical point in research and development."
The FSX program was launched in 1988 to replace 74 older Japanese-made F-1  fighters that are to be pulled out of service in 2001. The FSX's first flight  is scheduled for July 1995.
Under pressure from Washington, Japan agreed to allow American aircraft  manufacturers to work on what was orginally intended to have been an  exclusively Japanese-made fighter. The FSX has evolved into an advanced  version of the current US-made F-16 fighter.
But with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the need for the aircraft has  been called into question since it was designed to attack a fleet of Soviet  ships advancing on Japan.
Japan has already spent two billion US dollars on the FSX project and  another 600 million dollars is budgeted for this year. The planes are  scheduled to go into limited production in 1996.
