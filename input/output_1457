A tobacco company study done 30 years ago and  then suppressed could have saved millions of lives if the government had known  smoking was dangerous and addictive, a former government official said Monday.
"Treating the symptoms of smoking ... is closing the armory door after the  deadly instruments of destruction have been let loose," said Joseph Califano,  a former health secretary under president Jimmy Carter (1977-1981) and advisor  to president Lyndon Johnson (1963-1969).
In congressional testimony focusing on documents from Brown and Williamsom  Tobacco Corporation of Louisville, Kentucky, Califano estimated that Medicare  bills for smoking-related ailments would cost 16 billion dollars this year  alone.
"If we have known in 1964 what we know now, we could have turned our best  minds and energy then to arresting this killer," said Califano. "Now, 30 years  and nine million deaths later, we must move aggressively to stop the carnage."
The former government official also said he had been contacted by  attorneys for Brown and Williamson warning him that the information was based  on stolen information.
"I have never been subjected to such a crude attempt at intimidation,"  said Califano.
Smoking's biggest foe in congress, Representative Henry Waxman, said Brown  and Williamson had also contacted him and asked permission to review documents  because the tobacco company would send officials to testify.
"The tobacco industry is engaging in a pattern of trying to intimidate  people ... and making unreasonable requests to our subcommittee which will not  be permitted to keep us from doing our work," he said.
Brown and Williamson said Tuesday it was preparing to subpoena Waxman and  others who possess the papers. It has said they were stolen and taken out of  context.
