Benetton manager Flavio Briatore, who swooped to  take control of French strugglers Ligier on Friday, said he would take his  time before announcing plans for his second Formula One team.
Briatore said on Saturday he would take a few days before making any  announcements, adding: "My wish is to make Ligier very competitive as quickly  as possible.
"I won't be changing anything yet because I know nothing about the team --  I won't be studying the matter until Monday, after the Monaco Grand Prix."
Briatore said it was "very interesting" to be in charge of two teams  backed by different engines.
