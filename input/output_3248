Albanian opposition leader and former communist  prime minister, Fatos Nano, Monday appealed against a conviction and 12-year  sentence for embezzlement.
Nano's lawyer, Perparim Sanhxaku, demanded his client be freed pending the  re-opening of an enquiry into the allegations and said Nano had been convicted  on "falsified evidence."
Accused of having embezzled some seven million dollars in Italian aid  while he was prime minister, Nano, 42, refused to speak to the court during  his original trial in March and April.
For his appeal, Nano has chosen to defend himself and denounced the  "political trial" he says he is being subjected to. The criticism brought him  a reprimand from the president of the court of appeal, Prel Martini.
Since the fall of the communist regime in Albania in April 1992, numerous  former leaders have been convicted on a variety of charges.
Nexhmije Hoxha, 72, the widow of the regime's founder Enver Hoxha, was  sentenced in May to 11 years on corruption charges.
The former Communist Party leader and president, Ramiz Alia, 68, went on  trial Saturday, along with nine other former top communist officials charged  with misappropriation of state funds and abuse of power.
Nano's appeal continues Tuesday.
