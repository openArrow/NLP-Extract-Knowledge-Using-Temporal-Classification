Muluzi said he had not picked anyone from the Alliance for Democracy  (AFORD) because negotiations were still on with the party on power-sharing.
Muluzi's UDF won 84 of the 177 seats in parliament, failing to gain a  working majority and forcing the party to seek a coalition with AFORD.
"I have no problem appointing anyone from AFORD," he said, although he  gave most key portfolios, including those of foreign affairs and defence, to  his lieutenants.
It had been widely expected that Muluzi would offer the position of home  affairs to AFORD leader Chakufwa Chihana.
