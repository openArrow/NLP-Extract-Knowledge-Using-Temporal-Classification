lower. The price of wheat fell steadily lower, dropping over four  dollars to finish the week at around 113 pounds per tonne after the US refused  to sell Russia 400,000 tonnes of subsidised wheat.
Prices were also lower on expectations of a strong US winter wheat harvest.
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) predicted a 9.34 percent cut in  wheat production from the former Soviet Union to 76.3 million tonnes in  1994-1995. Imports were estimated to fall to 13.5 million tonnes from 14.02  million tonnes in 1993-1994.
The price of barley remained stable at around 109 pounds per tonne,  although European markets were calm on account of the Ascension holiday.
TEA: stable. The average auction price of tea remained stable at around  127 pence per kilo although demand was described as reasonably good.
The price of high quality tea from Africa rose on the continued civil  conflict in Rwanda, leading dealers to fear the worst for production from the  country.
The auction price for African medium quality tea dipped four pence to  eight pence. Teas from Sri Lanka followed the same trend.
COTTON: slightly lower. Prices suffered from a lack of activity and  slipped through the barrier at 0.86 dollars per pound, as the Ascension  holiday weighed on the market.
Austria and Switzerland were the main buyers during the week, while cotton  from central Asia was the most in demand.
WOOL: higher. The reference price of Australian wool on the Bradford  market was higher, reaching above 4.22 pounds per kilo, on firm demand and a  cut in Australian production.
Recent statistics show that exports from New Zealand, which is the world's  second producer after Australia, lifted above production during the first nine  months in the 1993-1994 season (July-June) resulting in a cut in stocks.
Production rose 13 percent, while exports lifted 21 percent, totalling 760  million dollars for the period.
New Zealand wool stocks, born out of a slump in prices in 1991, should be  used up by the end of the next season, analysts said.
