Philip Morris, the largest American tobacco  producer, will pay 250,000 dollars in state fines after violating a law  against mailing free cigarettes, judicial sources said Wednesday.
The case stems from a complaint filed by the wife of a Long Island  resident who received five packets of Marlboro cigarettes in the mail one year  after he quit smoking.
A 1992 New York law seeking to protect minors bans the distribution of  free cigarettes. In spite of the measure, Philip Morris sent samples to 44,000  New York residents last summer, said Mark Chassin, a health department source.
"Every day about 200 adolescents in New York State begin to use tobacco,"  said Chassin.
"Given the devasting health effects of tobacco use, we must use all of our  regulatory authority to stop cigarette promotions, which attract new smokers,  reinforce smoking among smokers, and contribute to relapse among smokers who  have quit," he added.
