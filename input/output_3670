Former Liverpool striker Dean Saunders was accused  here on Tuesday of trying to "inflict harm" on Chelsea skipper Paul Elliott  with a wild tackle.
The allegation was made by former England captain Terry Butcher in the  High Court.
Butcher made his comments during a court battle launched by Elliott, whose  career was ended by the tackle at Liverpool's Anfield stadium in September  1992.
Elliott, 30, claims 29-year-old Saunders jumped at him over the ball and  landed on the inside of his right knee, rupturing the ligaments.
Butcher said he saw the incident on television and his first thought was  that Saunders had gone over the top in a tackle.
He did not accept Welsh international Saunders, who joined Aston Villa for  2.3 million five days after the incident, made a mistake and missed the ball.
"I felt he had a chance to play the ball and that he didn't. I would say  he had no intention of winning the ball. It's my opinion he has jumped towards  the ball with the intention of missing it and inflicting harm upon Paul  Elliott."
Chelsea's orthopaedic consultant, Anthony Hall, considered it the worst  football injury he had seen - "more serious and showed a more forceful impact"  than road accident injuries he had seen.
Saunders and Liverpool deny liability.
Earlier, top referee Anthony Ward described the tackle as "dreadful".
