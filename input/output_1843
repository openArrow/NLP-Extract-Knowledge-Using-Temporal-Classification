Ansett Airline's New Zealand subsidiary is  forecasting a big improvement on last year's loss but acting chief executive  John Sheridan would not say if the company was now making money.
Ansett New Zealand competes against Air New Zealand on the main domestic  routes and is starting to enjoy good business as the New Zealand economy  improves and travellers snap up special cut-price fares.
"It's looking a lot better," Sheridan said. "The market is improving in  line with total domestic profitability.
"The aviation market is closely aligned to growth or change in GDP."
Ansett's results for this financial year are likely to be announced in  late October. Sheridan would not say if Ansett expected to make a profit for  the first time since it started flights in New Zealand in 1987.
The airline lost 37.2 million New Zealand dollars (21.2 million US) last  year, bringing its total losses in New Zealand over seven years of operation  to about 200 million dollars.
Air New Zealand, whose domestic operations have been returning  unsatisfactory profits, said this week it was expecting a bumper profit of up  to 200 million dollars this financial year. The figure includes returns from  both domestic and international operations.
