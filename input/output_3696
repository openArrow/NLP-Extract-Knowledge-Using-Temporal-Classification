Italy's new Interior Minister Roberto Maroni Tuesday  promised a relentless campaign against Mafia crime and left- and right-wing  extremism.
In his first press conference Maroni, the deputy leader of the federalist  Northern League, set the campaign as his ministry's number-one priority.
The minister, who travelled Monday to Palermo, Sicily, to mark the second  anniversary of the murder of anti-Mafia judge Giovanni Falcone, denounced  recent Mafia attacks against the property of left-wing mayors recently elected  on the island.
In the last few weeks some 20 cars and country houses have been torched in  such attacks.
"I have realised that a new front has been established in the fight  against the Mafia," Maroni said. He cited "new municipal administrations,  almost all progressive, which are showing great courage and determination" in  the face of the Mafia. He said they had his support.
Maroni added that commentators who described Italy's leftist and rightist  militants as belonging to two opposing camps were mistaken.
"Behind those groups lies a single ideology, that of violence," he said.  "To me (the groups) are the same and I will fight against both."
Maroni referred specifically to a march of 300 neo-Nazi skinheads in the  northern town of Vicenza ten days ago, and incidents sparked in the same town  last weekend by a group of leftist extremists.
