Fishermen in the central Philippines are  slaughtering dolphins to use them as food and bait for sharks, despite laws  against the catching of dolphins, a local newspaper reported here Tuesday.
The Philippine Inquirer quoted local officials as saying they had  discovered that fishermen from the tiny island of Pamalican were using a large  net to catch the dolphins, adding that they believed hundreds of dolphins had  already been killed.
Local officials found that dolphins made good bait for catching sharks  whose fins, meat and skin fetch high prices, sharply increasing their incomes.
The newspaper said the fishermen had been unaware that catching dolphins  is forbidden under Philippine law and had been warned they would be arrested  if they continued to do so. It did not say how long the fishermen had been  catching dolphins.
