Coffee prices continued to defy the laws of gravity  this week, soaring to new highs daily. The price of robusta jumped to its  highest level for five years after a cut in world production caused a shortage  on the markets.
Sugar was higher as India appeared ready to import on a large scale to  compensate for its production deficit. Vegetable oils and grains were likewise  higher.
The second star of the week was copper, which reached its highest level  since December 1992 Thursday, on a strong downtrend in stocks and continuing  demand in Europe and the United States.
Oil, which began the week on a feeble note, firmed after US statistics  showed a pick-up in demand.
The precious metals were also higher compared to the previous week, taking  advantage of the weakness of the dollar.
GOLD: higher. The price of gold lifted above 383 dollars per ounce  Thursday, but declined slightly Friday. Gold lifted on the dollar's weakness  and on a rise in silver which was once again courted by investors.
The situation at the Kloof mine in South Africa was back to normal after  workers returned to work after 11 days on strike.
Figures also generally showed that production from South Africa -- which  is the world's main producer -- had not been affected by the recent elections.
April figures showed a 0.2 percent rise in production from March with  production rising to 50,658 tonnes compared to 52,641 tonnes the previous year.
