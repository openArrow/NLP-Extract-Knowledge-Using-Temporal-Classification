Senior Japanese and US trade officials began  talks here Thursday aimed at breaking a three-month deadlock in bilateral  trade negotiations.
"We are making progress," said US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor as he  left the initial meeting to testify at a congressional hearing.
"It was a good start. We had an exchange of very detailed ideas," he said,  adding that the discussions were continuing.
Japanese deputy foreign minister for economic affairs Sakayuki Hayashi and  vice-minister at the international trade and industry ministry Sozabaru  Okamatsu made no comment as the entered the offices of the US Trade  Representative.
Hayashi was meeting briefly with Kantor before the Japanese  representatives and US trade negotiators sat down for talks.
US officials were cautiously optimistic Wednesday that the talks would  make progress, although they stressed that Thursday's meeting was "talks about  talks," not a full-fledged resumption of negotiations.
Both sides have said they are anxious to make progress before the Group of  Seven industrialized countries summit in Naples in July.
Bilateral trade talks collapsed in February over disagreement on ways to  measure progress in reducing Japan's 60-billion-dollar trade surplus with  Washington under an agreement reached in July.
