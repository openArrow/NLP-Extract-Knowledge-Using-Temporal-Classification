Gunfire echoed overnight around Lesotho's capital  as a crisis sparked by a strike by policemen in this tiny southern African  kingdom entered its 12th day Friday.
The British High Commission (embassy) has advised people to exercise  "extreme caution" in moving around Maseru.
Sporadic shooting was heard late Thursday and sustained firing in the  early hours of Friday.
The crisis deepened Thursday when talks between the government, the  striking police and prisons officers and the official opposition broke down.
Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle has rejected the police demands for a 60  percent pay hike, saying the country could not afford it.
About 2,500 policemen out of the total force of 3,000 went on strike on  May 9 and their action was later joined by junior prison guards.
The opposition Basuto National Party (BNP) also walked out of Thursday"s  meeting with the government, after Mokhehle accused the opposition of being  involved in the police strike.
Mokhehle's Basotholand Congress Party ousted the BNP from power in March  last year in the country's first democratic elections in 20 years.
South Africa's Archbishop Desmond Tutu is in Maseru at the invitation of  church leaders in a bid to mediate in the dispute.
The police strike is the latest crisis to hit Lesotho's increasingly  embattled government, which saw rival army factions fight across Maseru in  January and the killing of the deputy prime minister in a brief army uprising  in April.
