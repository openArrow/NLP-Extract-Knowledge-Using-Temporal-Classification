A Greek bearing a gift sent England on their way to  victory and severely embarrassed the whole business of World Cup qualification  in Tuesday's friendly match at Wembley.
After a sluggish start, in which the Greeks showed brief flashes of the  form that took them unbeaten to the top of their World Cup qualifying group,  Terry Venables' side, now facing a summer wondering what might have been,  slipped into gear on the greasy, rain-soaked surface and scored a 5-0 win.
England, in an unfamiliar all-maroon strip, effectively sealed victory  with three goals in 21 minutes.
Blackburn Rovers left-back Graeme Le Saux forged the breakthrough after 24  minutes with a cross that will give stand-in goalkeeper Christos Karkamanis  nightmares for a long time.
He pounced on the ball but allowed it to squirm from his grasp. Tottenham  midfielder Darren Anderton reacted ahead of Vaios Apostolakis and team-mate  Alan Shearer to stab the loose ball home and notch his first England goal in  his his second international.
The Greeks might console themselves with the thought that had Panayiotis  Tsalouchidis made more of his free header from Nioplias' chipped pass in the  fourth minute, the England juggernaut might never have got into first gear.
Sadly for him, however, his effort only found the grateful arms of  Blackburn goalkeeper Tim Flowers.
Greece have never beaten England and only scored their first goal against  them in a 2-1 defeat in Athens five years ago. But they had surely expected  better than this with arguably their strongest-ever squad.
It was a night that will surely have had England's failed World Cup  manager Graham Taylor wishing he could have turned back the clock.
