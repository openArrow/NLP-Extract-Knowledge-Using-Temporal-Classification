The Irish Republican Army (IRA) announced Saturday  that it had executed a man near Armagh, southwest of Belfast, because he had  allegedly been spying on one of its militants
Police said they found the body of a man in a field, but gave no further  details.
An IRA spokesman said in a telephone call to a Belfast news outlet that  the man was "arrested" and interrogated before being shot because "he was  observing movements of a republican."
The execution brought to 31 the number of people killed in sectarian  violence in Northern Ireland this year.
