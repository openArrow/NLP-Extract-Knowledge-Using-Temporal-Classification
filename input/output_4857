Loans to the West Bank and Gaza Strip promised  by the international community to support a 1993 autonomy accord have not been  disbursed because of the area's inadequate financial structure, said a World  Bank source Friday.
The bank said Thursday that it had approved a 128-million-dollar loan from  a trust fund it is coordinating for Gaza to run schools and roads and provide  water and electricity.
The loan, financed by Saudi Arabia, the Arab Fund, Kuwait and others, is  the first in a series that should eventually total two billion dollars to  rebuild the region returned to Palestinian administration after the Israelis  pulled out. The bank announced Friday that its share would be 30 million  dollars.
But while allocating the loans has been easy identifying financial  organizations capable of efficiently absorbing that much money has been  difficult.
"Reality takes more time than wishes," said Ram Chopra, World Bank Middle  East Director, as he described delays in disbursing loans pledged in September  1993 to support the Middle East peace process.
Chopra warned there could be a lag of a few months between the time that  the loan disbursements began and Israel's cash influxes stop. The risks of a  rapid financial shortfall were great, he said.
The World Bank official the PLO's delays in organizing itself and some  "exaggerated expectations" explain why the aid process has been slower than  the PLO and donors have expected.
Disbursing the funds was the main issue at a secret meeting between donor  nations and Palestinians in Washington in Monday, he said. A meeting of  participating countries and the Palestinians will take place on June 9 or 10  in Europe, he said.
Most of the aid will be bilateral but the World Bank will assume about 20  percent of 1.2-billion-dollar Emergency Rehabilitation Project, a three-year,  Palestinian assistance plan coordinated by the World Bank.
