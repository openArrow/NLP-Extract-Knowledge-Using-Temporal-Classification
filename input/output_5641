North Korean troops on Monday removed their  equipment from the Military Armistice Commission (MAC) hall in the border  truce village of Panmunjom, South Korean Defence Ministry officials said  Tuesday.
The officials said the border guards stripped microphones and speakers  from their side of the hall, which has been used to supervise the truce  between the two Koreas since the MAC was signed after the devastating 1950-53  Korean War.
North Korea unilaterally pulled its MAC representatives out of Panmunjom,  and on May 2 US officials said it had informed the US-led allied command of  its intention to pull out of the MAC altogether.
"We believe the North Koreans pulled out the equipment as a sign of  opposition to the MAC, and to it being led by a South Korean general," a  defence ministry official told AFP.
He said South Korea's equipment remained in place.
In March 1991, Major General Hwang Won-Tak became the first South Korean  to head the Southern side of the commission which had since the war been  headed by a US general.
Since his appointment North Korea has virtually boycotted full MAC  meetings, contending they would only talk with the US side because North Korea  signed the armistice agreement with the American Army.
Low-level meetings, however, have been held.
The move came amid disputes over whether the MAC, designed to supervise  military movements in the heavily fortified demilitarized zone, should be  abandoned, and the North Korean contention that it should be replaced with a  peace treaty.
In the absence of a peace treaty, the United States and North Korea are  still technically at war.
US 8th army officials were not immediately available for comment on the  move.
