Former diplomat Alexander Downer was elected  leader of Australia's conservative Liberal Party Monday, defeating incumbent  John Hewson by 43 voters to 36, a party official announced.
Hewson called the ballot himself last Friday in an effort to end  speculation about his leadership as support crumbled amid gloomy poll-ratings  and attacks from senior party members.
Right-wing lawyer Peter Costello, Downer's 36-year-old running-mate on a  "youth ticket" was elected deputy leader.
First elected Liberal leader in 1990, Hewson was re-elected in March 1993  after leading the coalition to disastrous defeat in a so-called unlosable  election while Australia was still suffering the impact of its worst recession  for 60 years.
Downer's election was the party's fifth leadership change since it was  last in office 1975-1983, each leader since being crippled by bitter  factionalism and feuding.
Party chiefs hope the new younger leadership will end the division,  distrust and personal recrimination which have been blamed for keeping  Australia's conservative coalition in the wilderness for 11 years.
The decision was announced by party whip Rod Atkinson after a meeting at  Liberal Party headquarters lasting little more than 15 minutes.
The election was the culmination of a long period of destabilisation over  the leadership of the Liberal Party and of the conservative coalition, of  which the rural-based National Party is the junior partner.
Polls last week showed the Labor government of Prime Minister Paul Keating  in a stronger position than when it astonished pollsters by winning last  year's election.
This was attributed partly to its strong economic performance, but also to  the disunity and internecine warfare in the Liberal Party.
