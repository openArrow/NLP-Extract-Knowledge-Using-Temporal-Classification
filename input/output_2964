China plans to step up its campaign against AIDS,  with the main emphasis on education and publicity campaigns especially for its  millions of young people, Health Minister Chen Minzhang said.
Chen told journalists covering a Sino-French medical conference that  condoms, whose use in China is not yet widespread, could effectively serve the  dual purpose of carrying out the country's strict family planning policy and  restricting the spread of the fatal acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
Speaking after the conference ended Saturday, Chen said that according to  official records China had registered 36 cases of AIDS among its population of  1.2 billion, as well as 1,243 carriers of the disease's precursor, the human  immune-deficiency virus (HIV).
Some reports from Chinese provinces, especially in the south and west, in  recent months have given far higher figures.
Sun Heng, Beijing representative of a French pharmaceutical company which  supplies AIDS test kits to China, told AFP the official totals "are probably  partial as up to now investigations have not been carried out in some  provinces."
The Geneva-based World Health Organisation, which has decided to grant  China aid in combatting the disease, has said there are between 5,000 and  10,000 HIV carriers in the country.
