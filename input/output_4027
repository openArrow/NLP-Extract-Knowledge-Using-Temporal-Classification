More than half the residents of central eastern  Europe are satisfied with the democracies operating in their countries, a  survey published here Wednesday showed.
On average, 59 percent of citizens of Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech  Republic, Hungary, Poland, Rumania, Slovakia and Slovenia are happy with the  democratic systems under which they live, the survey found.
The poll, carried out between January and March by Austrian pollsters Paul  Lazarsfeld among a sample of 1,000 people in each of the eight countries,  showed that only 39 percent of respondents favoured the market economies  operating in the region since the break-up of the Soviet Union.
But just 14 percent supported a return to communism.
The highest level of satisfaction for the political system came in the  Czech Republic, with 78 percent, while in Croatia and Hungary the rate fell to  51 percent.
Asked how long they expected to have to wait before reaching a  satisfactory standard of living, five percent said they had already done so,  while 13 percent predicted a delay of more than 10 years and 15 percent said  they would never attain it.
