The French computer group Bull said on Monday that  reports that Bull and its Japanese partner NEC would reach an agreement on  technological cooperation by June were premature.
A spokesman for Bull was commenting on Japanese press reports last week.
He confirmed that Bull was negotiating with NEC but said that a deadline  for completion of the negotiations could not be set.
The Japanese economic newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun had reported on  Thursday that an agreement would be completed during a meeting between  managers of the two groups at the beginning of June.
In Tokyo NEC had confirmed on Thursday that negotiations were being held   but provided no details of the date of an eventual agreement.
The Bull spokesman did not say whether or not the talks concerned the  joint development of a new generation of big computers to replace the System  3,900 which NEC supplies to Bull, as suggested by reports.
But he said that the talks went beyond big systems and covered also   "middleware" for Unix open systems.
Reliable sources said that the president of Bull, Jean-Marie  Descarpentries, was to meet managers of NEC at the beginning of the summer as  part of normal twice-yearly meetings.
Another manager from Bull was to visit Tokyo at the beginning of June as  part of regular contacts between the two companies.
NEC holds 4.4 percent of the capital in Bull. The two companies have been  trying for several months to find ways of strengthening their technological  cooperation to cope with rising costs in the development of computer products.
NEC has also said that success in technological agreements with Bull, and  an improvement in the state of Bull's weak finances, are conditions for its  participation in the forthcoming privatisation of the French company.
