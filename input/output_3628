The White House acknowledged Tuesday that the  UN embargo against Haiti was being circumvented by smuggling from the  Dominican Republic and called on the Dominicans to enforce the sanctions.
"Certainly there has been leakeage. There is no question about that," said  White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers.
The US media has extensively reported on the intense contraband of fuel  and other supplies across the two countries' border since the United Nations'  total commercial embargo went into effect Sunday.
"We want to improve the sanctions enforcement," said Myers. "We expect  them (the Dominican Republic) to adhere to the will of the international  community on that."
The embargo is based on UN Security Council resolution 917, which gave the  leadership of the Haitian military 15 days to step down or face an embargo on  everything but food, medicine, books, information materials and commercial  airline flights.
The toughened sanctions was the latest step in an international effort to  restore to power Haiti's democratically-elected President Jean-Bertrand  Aristide, who was ousted in a military coup September 30, 1991.
Myers said that the White House was waiting for a UN team's  recommendations to UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali on how to  improve the embargo's enforcement.
"We will decide then what steps to take in improving sanctions  enforcement," she said, noting that the UN team was due back from the  Dominican Republic Wednesday.
The three-member team, which includes a US customs inspector, went to the  Dominican Republic at the government's invitation to see what technical or  other help the United Nations could provide to tighten enforcement of the  santions.
