Karl Wendlinger's condition was described as  "stationary" here on Friday morning, the Austrian Formula One driver remaining  in a deep coma after his crash in Monaco on Thursday.
But the next two days are set to be crucial.
Wendlinger suffered head injuries when he crashed during a practice  session for the Monaco Grand Prix. He appeared to brake late coming out of the  tunnel, the fastest point on the street circuit.
Andre Falcy, the deputy head of Nice's university hospital, quoting  Professor Dominique Grimaud who is in charge of the unit caring for  Wendlinger, would only say that the Austrian's "state of health is stationary."
However, a doctor speaking on grounds of anonymity told AFP: "Wendlinger  is bound to suffer major functional after-effects, but if he pulls through the  next 48 hours, he could come out of this alive."
Wendlinger's parents arrived here overnight by car, and went immediately  to their son's bedside.
A medical bulletin on the Austrian was due to be issued later in the day.
The accident came two weeks after Brazil's triple world champion Ayrton  Senna and Austrian Roland Ratzenberger were killed at the San Marino Grand  Prix.
