A humiliating defeat that snapped a  12-game win streak has sent the Indiana Pacers a wake-up call.
The Pacers set a National Basketball Association (NBA) playoff record for  scoring futility in a 92-69 loss to Atlanta in game two of their quarter-final  series.
"This was good for us," Indiana guard Reggie Miller said. "Any time you're  riding high, sometimes you need a loss like this to bring you down, give you a  reality check."
The best-of-seven series continues here Saturday and Sunday, with Indiana  trying to keep the home-court edge they gained by splitting the first two  games.
"This team will bounce back," Indiana coach Larry Brown said. "It was a  thumping. But we've been thumped before and bounced back."
The Pacers missed 58 of 85 shots in game two. Indiana scoring leader  Miller managed just 12 points, missing 11 of 13 shots. He had scored 18 in  game one.
"After game one, in the back of a lot of our minds, we took game two for  granted," Miller said.
Dutch center Rik Smits miised 11 of 15 shots and pulled down just four  rebounds in game two. His poor play was especially troublesome for Brown.
"I can deal with a bad night on offense, but he has to be a presence  defensively and on the boards," Brown said.
Smits had shut down Orlando center Shaquille O'Neal as the Pacers swept  the Magic in a first-round series.
"We just have to pull ourselves together and come back this weekend,"  Smits said. "We can't take things for granted. We have to fight harder."
