The dollar closed higher at 104.87 yen on the Tokyo  foreign exchange market Monday, up 0.29 yen from the previous trading day's  finish of 104.58 yen.
Investors sold yen for dollars on prospects of less pressure to push up  the Japanese currency, dealers said.
The closing rate here was lower than 104.98 yen quoted in New York in late  trading Friday.
After opening at 105.07 yen, the greenback moved between 104.82 yen and  105.15 yen here Monday.
Spot turnover decreased from the previous trading day's 7.248 billion  dollars to 5.579 billion dollars.
Dealers said they believed that US pressure to bring the yen higher  decreased as Japanese and US officials were scheduled to resume framework  trade talks soon.
Officials of the two countries are to meet in Washington this week to pave  the way for framework talks, aimed at cutting Japan's huge trade surplus with  the United States.
The talks have been suspended since February when Japan rejected US  demands to set numerical targets in cutting the Japanese surplus.
A high yen helps boost Japanese imports and weakens the competitiveness of  its products overseas.
The mark closed at 1.6764 to the dollar here Monday, against 1.6705 the  previous trading day.
