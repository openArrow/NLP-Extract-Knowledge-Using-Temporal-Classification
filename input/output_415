Kazakhstan's Prime Minister Sergei Terchenko  arrived here Tuesday for a three-day visit to discuss ways of implementing  economic and trade agreements.
Terchenko, accompanied by a high-level political and economic delegation  including the ministers of energy, trade and transportation, was greeted at  the airport by Vice President Hassan Habibi.
He told reporters that his visit was aimed at boosting bilateral relations  and speeding up cooperation in various fields -- including air, sea and road  transportation.
Habibi said the two countries would discuss implementation of accords  already reached during visits to Alma Ata last October by President Ali Akbar  Hashemi Rafsanjani, and to Tehran by the Kazakh leader, Nursultan Nazarbayev,  in November 1992.
An official from the Kazakh embassy in Tehran told AFP that his country  and Iran would also discuss oil cooperation.
