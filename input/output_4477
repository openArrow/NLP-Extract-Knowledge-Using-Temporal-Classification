Malaysian property company Insas Bhd has  bought a 3.9 percent stake in listed British fabrics firm Liberty Inc to  diversify into the textiles trade, news reports said Friday.
Insas, which is listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange, acquired the  stake in Liberty, whose shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange, for  3.63 million British pounds (5.7 million US), the reports said.
They quoted Insas as saying that the purchase, made through its Singapore  subsidiary Dawnfield Pte Ltd, enabled the company to invest in a listed  British firm "at an entry price which understated its true asset value."
Liberty had a competitive edge as an international brand name which  produced fine fabrics, particularly silks, under the House of the Liberty  chain, Insas said.
