Wimbledon striker John Fashanu has escaped action  over alleged "elbowing", for the second time in six months.
Relegated Oldham Athletic submitted a video to the Football Association of  their 3-0 Premiership defeat at Selhurst Park last month, claiming a Fashanu  challenge had left defender Richard Jobson with concussion.
However, after studying the film, the FA decided to take no action against  Fashanu, 30, who was also cleared after a November clash with Gary Mabbutt  left the Tottenham defender needing surgery for severe facial injuries.
