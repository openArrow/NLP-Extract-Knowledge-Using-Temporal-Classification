Argentina have called off their two football  internationals in Japan after Japanese authorities refused team captain Diego  Maradona entry because of his drugs record.
Osamo Ighami, first counsel at the Japanese embassy, said Argentine  Football Association president Julio Grondona had told him of the decision.
Ighami said the justice ministry ruling which barred Maradona was  irreversible.
The Japanese justice ministry refused Maradona a visa because it said he  had been implicated in drug cases more than once.
Maradona was arrested in Buenos Aires in 1991 for cocaine possession, and  five months later was given a 14-month suspended sentence by an Italian court  for using cocaine.
He was also suspended from international competition for 15 months in 1991  and 1992 after testing postive for cocaine use.
The justice ministry's immigration bureau, however, granted a visa to  Claudio Caniggia, who recently ended a 13-month soccer ban for his alleged use  of cocaine. Caniggia would have been allowed to go to Japan because he had not  faced criminal charges.
Argentine had planned to play Japan and France in Japan as part of their  World Cup buildup.
