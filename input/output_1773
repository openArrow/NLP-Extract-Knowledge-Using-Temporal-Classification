Irishman Ray Close is on course  for a world title and millionaire status, according to American promoter Don  King.
Along with Frank Warren, King is promoting Ulsterman Close's challenge to  World Boxing Organisation super-middleweight champion Chris Eubank on Saturday  night.
King said: "Ray Close has kissed the Blarney Stone and has the spirit of  the fighting Irish to beat Eubank."
Close's manager Barney Eastwood has reportedly signed a deal with King to  promote his next four fights should he win, which would see the Irishman  travel to America.
King predicted: "If Ray Close wins on Saturday, he will be on course for  the million-dollar bracket.
"Chris Eubank is a good fighter but I believe the time is right for Ray to  lift himself to greater heights and win the title."
Meanwhile, the WBO have back-tracked on their decision to fly the judges  into Belfast on the morning of the fight. They will now arrive Thursday.
The WBO came in for fierce criticism when they said their original  decision was based on the political situation in Northern Ireland.
