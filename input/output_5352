South Korea will send a 50-member military medical  unit to the Western Sahara this year to assist a UN mission in the disputed  territory, the defense ministry said Monday.
The ministry said an advance team of 20 would be sent to the Western  Sahara, which is contested between Morocco and the Polisario Front, in August  following parliamentary approval.
The remaining 30 medics will be dispatched in September, it said.
The South Korean unit will take over from Swiss medical corpsmen in  Laayoune, the main town in the territory, where Swiss troops have been working  for 23 months.
Some 490 servicemen from 27 countries are posted in the Western Sahara to  supervise a regional truce between Morocco and Polisario Front guerrillas and  to prepare for a referendum on self-determination by the end of the year.
Voter registration has been under way since April across the territory and  in Sahrawi refugee camps in neighbouring Algeria.
The Polisario Front has declared an independent Sahrawi Arab Democratic  Republic in the Western Sahara, which was annexed by Morocco after Spanish  colonists pulled out in 1976.
