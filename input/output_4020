Rising tennis star Andrei Medvedev, asked why he no  longer smiled so much on court or cracked jokes in public, blamed the world's  press.
The 19-year-old Ukranian, a main title favourite at this year's French  Open Tennis Championships, claimed here Wednesday that the international press  were not doing their job.
He rounded calmly on journalists after reaching the third-round of the  men's singles, saying: "You say the players today don't have character. Every  guy has charisma and personality. But you don't look for it. You don't ask the  right questions.
"But to talk to you, players need to trust you.
"Recently I spent 45 minutes doing a question-and-answer interview. What  was written about me from that interview was a joke. They take my quote,  change two words and I look like a kid who has no idea what he is talking  about."
"I don't think this is fair and I don't feel like making any more jokes  with the press unless it is with a person I trust.
"You don't have to take me as a clown. I am not here to entertain you. If  I play good tennis -- this is the entertainment."
"We have to communicate. We need you and you need us. But if you do not  write the truth, then you can say the press is killing tennis.
"If you write the truth we can tell you a million stories."
Referring to the lack of laughter on court Medvedev admitted: "If you are  not concentrated you cannot win and it is not as easy as it looks.
"The athletes today are so strong and at the moment everyone serves at  more than 180kms per hour. Just try to return that serve. You will understand  why we are not smiling.
"Tennis is not a team sport. There is no bench. If I don't feel good --  nobody will play for me. I have to play. If my knee hurts -- either I play  with a bad knee or I pull out."
