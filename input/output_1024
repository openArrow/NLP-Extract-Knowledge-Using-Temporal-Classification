French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said on  Monday that veterans of the Normandy landings would be given accommodation  priority for 50th anniversary celebrations next June 6, his office reported.
Balladur, who held a ministerial meeting to discuss preparations for the  anniversary, said that of 60,000 available places, "45,000 would be reserved  for veterans, 28,500 of them in official ceremonies," a communique said.
The prime minister said the government wanted to show "all the gratitude  owing to those who, 50 years ago, contributed to the liberation of France."
France will be host to 10 heads of state and five prime ministers,  including President Bill Clinton and Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, and to  between 30,000 and 40,000 veterans, during ceremonies on June 5 and 6.
In April, French authorities cancelled the hotel reservations of Canadian  and British veterans at a Deauville hotel, intending to give their rooms to  official visitors, but reversed the decision after a storm of protests.
All available accommodation in Normandy for miles around the landing  beaches has been booked up for months.
