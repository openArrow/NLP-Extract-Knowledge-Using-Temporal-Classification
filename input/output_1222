Israel officially handed over  civilian authority to the Palestinians on the Gaza Strip on Tuesday after 27  years of occupation, a correspondent reported.
In a brief ceremony at the Erez entry point into the Strip, about 30  Israeli departmental heads symbolically passed on authority to their  counterparts in the new Palestinian administration in accord with the PLO  autonomy deal.
The two sides signed a series of documents and an inventory of euqipment  transferred to the Palestinians.
However the Palestinians denied some of the equipment had been handed over  and crossed it out on the lists. The dispute will be passed on to a liaison  committee.
Israeli General Duby Gazit, head of the military adminstration of the Gaza  Strip, and Zakaria al Agha, a member of the new Palestinian authority, were to  ratify the documents.
Israeli troops were expected to complete their redeployment on the Gaza  Strip within the next 24 hours, leaving the Palestinians to maintain order  everywhere apart from in the 20 Jewish settlements.
The Palestinians assumed control of the West Bank town of Jericho on  Friday.
Under the autonomy agreement the Palestinians are to be responsible for  their daily lives, controlling their economy, education, taxation, health,  social welfare and tourism in Gaza and Jericho.
