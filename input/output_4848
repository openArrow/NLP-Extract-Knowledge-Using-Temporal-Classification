The World Bank has awarded a loan of 150  million dollars to fund a soil erosion project in China's Loess Plateau,  officials said.
Juergen Voegele, World Bank task manager for the 248.7 million dollar  project, said in announcing the credit Thursday that erosion has continued on  the Loess Plateau largely uninterrupted for thousands of years, turning it  into "something like the surface of the moon."
According to the World Bank the region affected is one of the poorest in  China with annual per capita income of 35 to 50 dollars.
The region includes Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces.
The project will have two main components. The first is the construction  of land development and erosion control works on 15,600 square kilometers  (6,000 square miles) in the region.
Based on trials, grain production could increase by 50 percent and fruit  production by 400 percent, said the bank. The project will involve more than  2,000 villages and 1.2 million people.
The second part will focus on training, technology transfer, and research  to ensure local conservation agencies can monitor and control the anti-erosion  campaign in the future.
