LONDON, May 19 (AFP) - The British commander of United Nations forces in  Bosnia Michael Rose came within six inches of getting a sniper's bullet  through his head, according to an interview published in Today newspaper  Thursday.
But, despite the near-miss, Rose dismissed the "prophets of doom and  gloom" undermining the peace process, saying the change for the better in the  former Yugoslavia had been "staggering".
In light of a French decision to withdraw of 2,500 troops by the end of  the year, Rose said: "It would be a disaster for this country if the UNPROFOR  mission came to an end."
"But if there was a major deterioration and war broke out everywhere,  people might feel it wasn't worthwhile. I certainly wouldn't make any  judgement about the French position, because it could be all our positions."
When the bullet whistled past, Rose, wearing neither his helmet nor a flak  jacket, was talking to two Serb soldiers, who leapt for safety.
"It passed very close between us (indicating a distance six inches from  his face) and they all leapt for their lives.
"I asked them why they were jumping and they wanted to know why I hadn't.  I said, 'I am a general. No-one would dare shoot a general'," Rose said,  laughing the danger off.
But he admitted: "The peace is very frail. We're in a fragile situation  which could unravel at any time."
However, he said: "I know what we're about. I don't listen to the prophets  of doom and gloom."
He said the change in Bosnia had been "staggering".
"There is such negative discussion in the world's press, and it's deemed  to be a failure when it isn't. It is an extraordinary success."
