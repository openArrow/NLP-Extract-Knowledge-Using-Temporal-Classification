Former French minister Bernard Kouchner and  officials accompanying him dived into a culvert to take cover Sunday when  their convoy came under fire as it entered Kigali, A UN spokesman said.
The convoy had just entered Kigali on its way back from Gitarama, south of  Kigali, where Kouchner had gone to meet interim government officials,  spokesman Moctor Gueye told AFP by telephone from Kigali.
Nobody was wounded, Gueye said, and the gunmen were not identified.
The convoy was being escorted by Rwandan government forces who have been  battling the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front for control of the city during the  past month.
Heavy fighting was reported in Kigali on Sunday.
UN soldiers in Rwanda are investigating the shooting incident.
Kouchner, former minister for health and humanitarian action, has spent  several days in Kigali holding talks with both sides in the Rwanda conflict,  which flared between the minority Tutsi and the majority Hutus following the  mysterious plane crash death of president Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, on  April 8.
An estimated 200,000 people have died in the ethnic violence in the past  five weeks. Another half a million had fled to neighbouring countries.
