South African President Nelson Mandela met  ministers Friday to discuss reports that former president Frederik de Klerk  handed vast tracts of land to Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini in a secret deal  made days before the election.
Land Affairs Minister Derek Hanekom told the domestic news agency SAPA  that the deal was due to be discussed between Mandela and De Klerk, now  Mandela's deputy, on Monday.
The Weekly Mail and Guardian newspaper reported Friday that De Klerk had  transferred control of three million hectares of state land to Zwelithini just  before he was voted out of office in the election of April 26-29.
The newspaper said the land was ceded to a trust controlled by Zwelithini  and was now effectively private land and could not be used by the ANC-led  government for redistribution to blacks.
The newspaper said the deal had been made in order to convince Zwelithini  and his uncle, Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, to  reverse their boycott of the watershed vote.
The two Zulu leaders agreed to support the election only a week before  polling and the IFP went on to win control of KwaZulu-Natal province and gain  three cabinet seats in the government of national unity.
Mandela's office said in a statement late Friday that the new president  wished to "state categoricaly that he only became aware of the land deal today  from media reports."
Neither Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) nor any of its officials  "were involved in discussions on this deal."
Mandela would issue a more comprehensive statement as soon as he had met  the concerned parties, his office said.
De Klerk Friday denied he had been involved in a secret deal and Buthelezi  dismissed the report as "cheap politicking and mischief-making by people who  do not want peace in our troubled land," SAPA reported.
