But no such warning was given in qualifying last Sunday when Marco Greco's  car ran out of gas on the infield safety lane.
"I was amazed that in the final day of qualifying, they left a car in the  safety lane between the third and fourth turns," Mansell said. "That was right  where Paul Tracy had been when he had his accident earlier in the month."
Mansell joined Raul Boesel and Mario Andretti in second-guessing the  decisions of speedway officials.
"They have the ability to make some choices here about whether or not they  throw the yellow flag," Mansell said. "Like Raul and Mario, I have questions  about the way things happen at certain times."
Mansell used an aggressive passing style at Indy last year, moving by on  an seldom-used inside line and drawing some criticism from US television  commentators.
"I listened to that (while watching a replay) and said, 'Nigel, what the  hell are you doing now?'" Mansell said. "There are a few maneuvers I might not  try again. I now know some things I am supposed to do."
He also knows some things about the differences in how English is spoken  in US and British cities. Mansell joked that common phrases in England such as  blowing one's "hooter" or "knocking you up in the morning" have different  meaning here.
"It's quite a challenge with the differences in American slang," Mansell  said. "Greg Norman and I have similar problems. It's quite interesting."
Mansell also has to be careful of picking up US terms, such as the  waist-tied packs Americans wear on their rears and known as fanny packs.
"I have to watch what I say when I go home," he said. "For instance, I  can't believe what you call your bums. Fannies. Don't do that in England. What  does it mean? Let's just say it's front to back."
Still, Mansell brings a British resolve to Indy.
"I'm very much an Englishman in this country. I wear the flag on my helmet  and I'm proud."
