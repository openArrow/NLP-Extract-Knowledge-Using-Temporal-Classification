North Korea is expected to soon test a new missile  following last year's launching of the Nodong-1, capable of reaching Japan's  west coast, newspapers here said Saturday.
The Yomiuri Newspaper, citing military sources, said that Japanese  officials received the information from the US government, which confirmed  last week through its satellite that Pyongyang is prepared to test fire a  missile.
The sources said the satellite showed that many trucks and cranes for  launching arrived at its missile base, while a number of survey ships to gauge  distances of missiles were anchored off the shore.
The Tokyo Newspaper said North Korea was to test a new type of the  Nodong-1, which was tested May last year from the east coast of North Korea  near its borders with Russia and China, flying 500 kilometers (310 miles)  toward Japan.
The Nodong-1, with its range of 1,000 kilometers (625 miles), could be  fitted with nuclear or chemical warheads.
