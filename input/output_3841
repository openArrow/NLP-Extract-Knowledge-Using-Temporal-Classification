Cheered on by the thousands of excited youngsters on the traditional  'Children's Day', Pierce started like an express train.
In her first service game she lined up four consecutive points which  included one spectacular behind the back retrieve which turned out to be a  winner, and a midcourt backhand volley which sent the ball sizzling into the  corner before the Italian had time to move.
It was the first of many such volleys.
The first set lasted just 24 minutes and Bentivoglio, a semi-finalist at  the Italian Open last year, had to wait another ten minutes before holding  serve to score her only game of the match.
With Martina Navratilova, Kimiko Date, and Magdalena Maleeva all victims  of the first round holocaust which left six seeds on the sidelines, her road  to a showdown with Graf looks clear.
There was plenty for the home crowd to cheer on the new 'A' showcourt  where Frenchman Fabrice Santoro was leading American Jonathan Stark 6-2, 4-2.
On the number-one showcourt one of the top men's hopes, fourth-seeded  Andrei Medvedev of the Ukraine, had taken the first set 6-4 against Swedish  opponent Nicklas Kulti.
