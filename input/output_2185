Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama,  hailed Thursday what he called a resurgence of Buddhism in post-Soviet Russia.
"Our centuries-olds ties with Russia have now been restablished after a  few difficult decades," the Dalai Lama said.
He said more than 100 Buddhist monks from republics such as Kalmyk in the  south of the Russian federation and Buryat in Siberia had returned to Russia  after studying in India. The monks, he said, "work today in this great  country".
He added: "Residents of republics where the population is mostly Buddhist  are very enthusiastic about the re-establishment of their religious activity."
The Dalai Lama arrived Wednesday for a four-day visit during which he is  to meet with members of parliament and Russian Orthodox Patriarch Aleksy II.
He said he had no meeting planned with government officials.
With his government-in-exile based in India, the Dalai Lama is leading a  campaign against China's takeover of Tibet.
