Popular support for Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata's cabinet, formed late last month, stands at 40.9 percent, a Jiji Press  poll showed Sunday.
It was 5.3 points lower than public support given to the cabinet of Hata's  predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa shortly after he came to power last August, Jiji  said.
The first Jiji poll on the Hata cabinet questioned 1,400 voters before  justice minister Shigeto Nagano resigned over his controversial remarks on  Japan's military past.
Nagano resigned after saying the 1937 Nanjing massacre in China by  Japanese troops was a fabrication and that Japan did not wage a war of  aggression during World War II.
