Nearly 100 Rwandan nurses, doctors and drivers of  the relief organization Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) have been killed in the  country's civil war since mid-April, MSF announced Friday.
The killings happened inside refugee camps, hospitals and medical centers.
An MSF team that visited the massacre sites said only 40 civilians out of  about 2,800 grouped at the Saint Joseph center at Kibongo survived a massacre  there on April 15.
The others were killed by exploding grenades, rockets, automatic arms fire  or were knifed, between 2:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. They were buried in a mass  grave under the bishopric's refectory later, the organization said.
A nurse who had been kidnapped and raped by army troops and beheaded,  along with two drivers and a clergyman, was among the victims.
MSF said the killings among its staff were the first since the  organization was created in 1971.
The report came as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Jose Ayala Lasso  made an impassioned plea Friday for the world to end the "unimaginable human  tragedy" in Rwanda.
Ayala Lasso said in Geneva the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis had both  welcomed his proposal to set up a commission to determine the causes of the  massacres which have left some 200,000 dead in the tiny highland central  African state, and determine responsibility for them.
