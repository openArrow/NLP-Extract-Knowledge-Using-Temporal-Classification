Scottish champions Rangers failed to  serve up a champagne finish here on Saturday after being held to a goalless  stalemate by Dundee.
Rangers, without a win for four games before Saturday's encounter, had  hoped to celebrate by thrashing their relegated opponents.
But even Mark Hateley, Scotland's player of the year boasting 28 goals  this season, could not break the deadlock.
Dutchman Pieter Huistra also twice failed from close range, while Rangers'  substitute Alexei Mikhailichenko squandered the game's best chance near the  end when he shot wide from point-blank range after Jim Duffy failed to deal  with Stuart McCall's cross.
Aberdeen finished runners-up to Rangers for the fourth time in five  seasons after drawing 1-1 at home with Celtic.
