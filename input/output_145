World Cup longshots and hosts the United States are  favorites at least in the Philippines, where an autographed football from the  team fetched the top price of 76,000 pesos (about 2,714 dollars) at a Miss  Universe charity auction here.
The ball, brought in by Miss United States, Frances Louise Parker, raised  the highest price in a May 10 auction that included an antique Taiwan teapot,  century-old prints from Britain, and ancient silver and brass Egyptian plates,  organizers said.
Contestants from 77 nations that are taking part in the May 21 pageant in  Manila donated the presents to raise funds for local charities.
