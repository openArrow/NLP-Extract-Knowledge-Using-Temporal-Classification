Six people died and three were  seriously wounded in an overnight shotgun attack in a Medellin, police  reported Sunday.
Unidentified gunmen fled the scene in a car after shooting at a group of  people gathered on a street corner in the north of the violence-torn city  early Sunday.
Initial police reports said the group was standing at a drug dealers'  gathering point and may have been attacked by vigilantes.
