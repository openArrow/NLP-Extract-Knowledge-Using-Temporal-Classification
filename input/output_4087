US lawmakers voted to approve a  13.6-billion-dollar foreign aid package Wednesday, bucking angry dissent over  how much aid Russia and South Africa should get.
The House of Representatives adopted the legislation in a 337 to 87 vote.  Top recipients of aid as in past years were Israel, at three billion dollars,  and Egypt, at 2.1 billion dollars.
Debate flared into heated confrontation over the amount of aid the United  States should send to Russia and South Africa.
Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican argued South African funding should have  been frozen at its present 80-million-dollar level. He said he objected to  members of the new South African government having ties to the communist party.
Representatives shot down his amendment to limit the funds and approved an  increase to 140 million dollars, in addition to 50 million dollars to insure  US investments in South Africa.
"If you don't like people in the South African government, so what!"  shouted Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat.
Funds for former Soviet republics also survived a cutback attempt, with  the House appropriating a total 875.5 million dollars instead of 552 million  dollars.
In addition to the former Soviet Republics, the bill appropriates 360  million dollars for Eastern Europe and the Baltic States.
The measure now moves on to the Senate for consideration.
