Economic Reform Minister Asdrubal Baptista  resigned Tuesday, fewer than 24 hours after President Rafael Caldera named him  to the post, officials said.
Baptista came under fire from other memebers of Caldera's economy team for  a report issued while he was president of the huge government holding company  Confederacion Venezolana de Guayana, known as CVG, presidential palace sources  said.
CVG is the umbrella under which the state's non-petroleum natural resource  industries are grouped, including iron, aluminum, bauxite, hydroelectric  power, and other minerals.
There was no immediate official response to Baptista's resignation.
Caldera reshuffled his cabinet Monday, naming six new ministers to  overhaul his economic strategy.
