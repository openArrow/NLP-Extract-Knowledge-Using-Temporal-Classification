The PLO on Thursday gave Israel a partial list of  members of the Palestinian authority due to take power next week in Gaza and  Jericho, the chief Palestinian negotiator said.
Nabil Shaath told a press conference "the (Palestinian) cabinet has been  formed, I just transmitted it to Yitzhak Rabin," the Israeli prime minister.
He said the PLO had agreed with Rabin that the new authority "will be  functional from Wednesday."
But he added the list given was still incomplete as it had only 15 of the  24 (eds: correct) members. The other nine would be appointed in three of four  days at the latest.
He said the members included PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, Faisal Husseini,  the leading PLO official in the occupied territories, Hanan Ashrawi, former  spokeswoman of the negotiating team, Saeb Erekat, head of the Palestinian team  to the bilateral talks and Shaath himself.
He said Arafat was due to enter the autonomous territories in June but  "Arafat may have some surprises for us, and it could happen before that date."
Shaath justified sending the partial list to Rabin saying "the Israelis  want to be sure that we are serious."
But Samir Goshe, leader of the Popular Struggle Front, denied in Tunis  that he had officially agreed to take part in the authority, saying he had  made his involvement conditional on a "democratisation" of the PLO's working  methods.
He said he had been surprised to see his name on the list announced by  Shaath.
A Palestinian official at the PLO headquarters in Tunis said Arafat will  continue his consultations over the remaining positions.
According to Shaath, the PLO's offices for foreign affairs, refugees and  its relations with Israel and Jewish organisations would stay in its Tunis  headquarters.
