The trial of seven Palestinians implicated in the  murder of a Jordanian diplomat opened here Wednesday in the Lebanese capital.
The members of Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council are charged in the  killing of the first counsellor at the Jordanian embassy, Naeb Omran  al-Maaitah, who was shot dead outside his home here in January.
Four were being tried in absentia.
Abu Nidal's group has repeatedly denied any involvement in the killing.
The chairman of the Council of Justice, the court dealing with state  security affairs, rejected a defence request to cancel the trial, an official  source said.
The lawyer, whose identity was not disclosed, said the confessions given  by the suspects were extorted under "moral and physical pressure."
The next session set for June 30 will be devoted to hearing the accused,  the state-run agency ANI said.
