A huge majority of Singaporeans favour caning  for vandalism, with almost absolute support for the punishment in the case of  violent crimes, according to a new opinion poll published Sunday.
The Sunday Times said it appeared overall support for caning had hardened  following the controversy surrounding the caning of 18-year-old American  Michael Fay in early May.
The case attracted worldwide attention and criticism of Singapore and was  publicly opposed by US President Bill Clinton.
But the newspaper said Singaporeans had closed ranks in the face of  "bully-boy tactics" by the US news media, with 79 percent saying vandals  should be caned. A 1986 poll had found only 26-percent support for caning, it  added.
The poll of 705 people found that 99 percent of Singaporeans favoured the  caning of rapists while there was 92-percent support for caning in cases of  illegal weapons possession.
Almost half of Singaporeans -- 44 percent -- favour the introduction of  caning as a punishment for women, while 35 percent think male offenders aged  over 50 should be caned, the poll found.
The transformation of the gangster-ridden Singapore of the 1950s into what  is today one of the world's safest major cities is widely credited here to the  government's no-nonsense stand on law and order.
Caning is used as a form of punishment in Singapore for such serious  crimes as rape, unlawful possession of firearms, robbery, extortion. Some  non-violent crimes such as illegal entry by foreigners and vandalism -- of  which Fay was convicted -- are also punishable by caning, but boys under 16  and men over 50 are not caned.
The survey also showed that 99 percent of those polled felt safe living in  Singapore and 96 percent felt safe walking around their neighbourhood.
