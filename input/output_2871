Public order in China has gravely deteriorated  this year and urgent steps are required to prevent serious unrest, a senior  communist party official was quoted as saying Sunday.
In a markedly frank assessment of current trends threatening social  stability across the country, the director of the party's Central Committee  for Comprehensive Management of Public Security, Ren Jianxin, said particular  attention nedded to be paid to signs of unrest in the countryside.
"Since the beginning of the year, the public order situation throughout  China has become extremely grim," Ren said in a speech carried on the front  page of the official People's Daily.
He especially warned of mass discontent in many rural areas where incomes  have failed to keep pace with inflation and where resentment is growing over  regional disparities in living standards.
"We must never underestimate the effect that problems of public disorder  in the countryside will have on the country as a whole," Ren said, calling on  governments and judicial departments at all levels to take immediate steps to  ensure social stability.
"Common law criminals must be punished swiftly and more heavily," he said,  while education regarding state laws and regulations should be strengthened  for minor offenders.
In a clear indication that the party has effectively lost control of the  situation in some rural areas, Ren said major efforts must be made to  resurrect and strengthen "paralysed or semi-paralysed local party  orgainsations and rural commitees."
The remarks followed a series of warnings by top government and party  leaders that the traditional pillars of social stability in China are cracking  as the country makes the transition to a market economy.
Senior party leaders warned last week that corruption and apathy among  officials were exacerbating the destabilising effects of unemployment, poverty  and inflation, while President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng have both made  speeches stressing the paramount importance of ensuring social stability by  all means necessary.
The stability theme has been hammered home at every opportunity in the run  up to the fifth anniversary on June 4 of the crushing of the 1989  pro-democracy movement, reflecting official fears of social unrest among  groups disenfranchised by economic reform.
