A move by Williams-Renault to replace Ayrton Senna  with fellow Brazilian Rubens Barrichello has been rejected by the Jordan Grand  Prix team.
Louise Goodman, spokeswoman for the Irish team, confirmed the approach on  Tuesday but said: "The reply was that Rubens was not available."
Frank Williams had reportedly offered 6.5 million pounds to secure the  services of the 21-year-old as a replacement for the three times world  champion who was killed at the San Marino Grand Prix.
Barrichello escaped a terrifying crash in practice at Imola with no more  than a broken nose.
Goodman said: "It never got as far as contracts. Rubens has a three year  contract that started at the beginning of last year.
"There are options at the end of each year, where the situation can be  reviewed, but we are not even contemplating releasing him because Rubens is a  crucial part of our plans."
The Williams team declined to make any comment on the approach.
