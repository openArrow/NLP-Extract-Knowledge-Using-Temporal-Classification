Michael Stitch capped a perfect World  Team Cup performance by leading Germany to a final win over Spain here on  Sunday.
Stich, who beat French Open favourite Pete Sampras of the United States  earlier in the week, added French Open champion Sergi Bruguera's scalp before  clinching the deciding doubles with Patrick Kuehnen.
The German pair saw off Carlos Costa and Tomas Carbonell 7-5, 4-6, 6-4 to  take the title 2-1.
But the Spaniards had their chances, Costa serving for the first set at  5-4 only to be broken.
Stich suffered the same fate at 4-4 in the second to allow his opponents  to level and he lost his serve again at 1-1 in the decider.
But Costa was broken in turn as the Germans made it 2-2 and, at 5-4, they  broke Carbonell to love to win the event.
Costa beat Bernd Karbacher 6-2, 4-6, 6-0 for Spain's solitary success in  the final.
