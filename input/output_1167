Machinery orders from Japan's private sector in  March rose 10.3 percent from the previous month, reversing a revised 6.3  percent fall in February, the Economic Planning Agency said Tuesday.
The orders, excluding those for ships and from electric power companies,  which tend to fluctuate widely, totalled 946.8 billion yen (nine billion  dollars), down 0.2 percent from a year earlier for the second straight  year-on-year drop, the agency said.
For the year to March, private-sector machinery orders fell 9.4 percent  from the previous year to 10,568.4 billion yen, marking the third consecutive  yearly fall, it said.
Machinery orders are a leading short-term indicator for corporate plant  and equipment investments.
