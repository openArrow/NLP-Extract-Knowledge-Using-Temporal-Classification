Dutch Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch Ballin  resigned Friday following a police scandal, the government announced.
Right and left wing deputies had joined Wednesday to pass a motion of no  confidence in Ballin.
Ballin and Interior Minister Ed van Thijn were accused of failing to set  up safety measures after disbanding an inter-regional police team in 1993, and  Ballin was also blamed for the disappearance of 36 tonnes of soft drugs from a  40-tonne consignment imported as "bait" for underworld figures.
