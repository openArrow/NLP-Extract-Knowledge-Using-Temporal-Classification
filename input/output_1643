Yemen's two-week-old civil war has begun to paralyze  the country, hitting its oil industry and threatening the entire economy of  one of the world's poorest nations.
Yemen relies heavily on foreign currency earned from exports of its total  oil production of 320,000 barrels per day (bpd). But heavy fighting between  rival north and south forces has badly hit the industry.
The Canadian oil company, Canoxy, has already suspended extraction of  120,000 barrels per day (bpd) from the Massila fields in the eastern province  of Hadramut.
Tankers, faced with higher insurance fees because of the war, refuse to  load at the port of Mukalla, 700 kilometers (435 miles) east of the southern  capital Aden and the destination of Massila's oil.
However, the American oil company Hunt has continued to operate in another  major field at Maareb, east of the capital Sanaa, piping out oil to the port  of Hodeida on the Red Sea.
The war has also created a rush on fuel in Sanaa, the northern capital cut  off from oil supplies from the country's only refinery in the southern  stronghold of Aden.
Long lines of people queue daily at gas stations for small quantities of  fuel distributed by the army which has requisitioned most of the available  supplies.
The operation of the Little Aden refinery, at the extreme west of the bay  of Aden, is also threatened, even though it has been working to full capacity.  Its output could be severely reduced or even halted by any suspension in  Massila's production if the fighting continues.
The fuel shortage is limiting the transport of goods and produce in the  north. And, in the south, Aden is surrounded by fighting and can only be  reached by sea.
But many shops and markets in Sanaa and Aden remain well stocked, despite  panic-buying by some families. And banks and services also continue to operate  in the cities, even though many are badly understaffed.
Schools in Aden have closed, and open only irregularly in the north as  many foreign teachers have been evacuated. Residents of Aden are unable to  leave the city, but Sanaa is almost deserted after people fled to take refuge  in nearby villages.
The massive evacuation of thousands of European and Asian expatriates has  also thrown many sectors of the economy in disarray.
But the fighting has not adversely affected the Yemeni currency which has  only risen slightly to 80 rials a dollar in Sanaa and Aden, whereas before the  war it was around 70 rials to the dollar.
Experts say the rial has been saved by a busy black market, always strong  in Yemen, classed as one of the 32 least developed countries in the world.
