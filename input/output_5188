An eight-day international football festival  ended disappointingly here Sunday with English premier division sides  Liverpool and Aston Villa held to gaolless draws.
In the first match before a crowd of 40.000 at freezing Ellis Park rugby  stadium, severely depleted Villa battled against Moroka Swallows, a struggling  local side.
Villa, who lost to Liverpool and beat Manning Rangers last week, did get  the ball into the net after 80 minutes, but the Guy Whittingham header was  disallowed because a teammate was ruled offside.
Johannesburg glamour club Kaizer Chiefs looked more impressive than  Liverpool, but showed little imagination in attack.
The Chiefs' best spell came midway through the second half when captain  Neil Tovey and Nicky Shaw were just off target with fierce drives.
The visitors almost snatched victory with three minutes left when the  Chiefs' goalkeeper Steve Crowley missed a deep cross, but Lee Jones hesitated  and the ball was scrambled clear.
Results:
Moroka Swallows (South Africa) 0 Aston Villa (England) 0
Kaizer Chiefs (South Africa) 0 Liverpool (England) 0
Youth international: South Africa 4 Swaziland 2
