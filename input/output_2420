Russian Defence Minister General Pavel Grachev  warned Friday of impending violence in Crimea failing talks to restore calm  after the local parliament moved towards secession from Ukraine, Interfax  reported.
Grachev, speaking after talks with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe,  said the tension in Crimea "could ignite a fire unless the situation was  normalised through talks".
The Crimean parliament earlier voted to restore a 1992 constitution in a  move that amounted to a declaration of independence from Ukraine.
Grachev said he had received reports that Kiev had dispatched Ukrainian  troops, including special elite forces, to Crimea and that troops in the Black  Sea region of Odessa had been placed in a state of combat readiness.
He warned both sides against staging "provocations" against the Black Sea  Fleet, saying it belonged to both states and "was governed by two presidents."
