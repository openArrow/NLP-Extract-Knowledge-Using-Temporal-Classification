Former Russian vice-president Alexander Rutskoi  called Saturday for early presidential elections and the expansion of a  revitalised Russian superpower to the borders of the former Soviet Union, news  agencies said.
Rutskoi, principal leader of the October parliamentary uprising, told the  opening congress of his People's Party of a Free Russia, its top priority was  "the battle for early presidential elections."
The elections are scheduled to take place in June 1996.
He also called for "the reconstruction of Russia as a great power within  the borders of the Soviet Union."
Around 130 delegates attending from 60 regions overwhelming voted to  return Rutskoi as leader and to change the party's name to the Russian  Social-Democratic People's Party.
The delegates approved a motion defining the party's goal as "reuniting  the opposition and creating a mass socio-patriotic movement," and called on  the "president, government and parliament to hold early presidential  elections."
Rutskoi, freed from jail in February after receiving an amnesty from the  conservative dominated parliament, denounced the "current policy of economic  terror from this anti-people police state."
There was no question of "half measures, it is either collaboration or the  fight against the police state," Rutskoi told the assembled delegates.
Reiterating his call for an opposition coalition to President Boris  Yeltsin, the former vice-president called on his supporters to "initiate  consultation among of the opposition forces."
Rutskoi on May 9 told 20,000 conservative demonstrators that the current  regime would collapse in 1995.
Foreign journalists were excluded from the congress.
