Italian Andrea Peron won the  eighth stage of the Tour DuPont cycle race on Thursday but Russian Viatcheslav  Ekimov kept a 34-second lead in the overall standings.
Peron, a 1992 Olympic time-trial silver medallist, broke away in the last  15 kilometers to win the 201-km stage from Banner Elk, North Carolina, in five  hours 35 minutes 47 seconds.
Briton Sean Yates was second in 5:36:37 and Djamolidin Abdujaparov of  Uzbekistan was third in 5:36:39.
Ekimov, the eight-time world track champion, finished eighth, in the same  time as American Lance Armstrong, who remained second in the overall standings.
"We controlled the race from the start and I'm satisfied," said Ekimov.  "But I don't know about the time trial. Lance and I have the same chance to  win, but it's short and flat, so it looks like my race."
Friday's ninth stage takes the field 214 kilometers to Charlotte North  Carolina.
The 12-day, 1,700-km race concludes Sunday in Winston-Salem, North  Carolina.
Armstrong, the world road racing champion, admitted that he would have  difficulty making up the gap to Ekimov, who is expected to dominate the  closing time trial on Sunday.
"There is a 90 percent chance he is going to win," Armstrong said. "My  only opportunity is if he cracks or something else happens."
