Fiji scored 10 tries as they beat  New Zealand third division side East Coast 62-6 in their second rugby union  tour match here Saturday.
The Fijians led 26-3 at halftime and increased that domination in the  second half. They were too big and strong in the forwards for the home side  and played an effective mauling game.
East Coast managed only two penalties and never looked like crossing the  Fiji line.
Fiji coach Meli Kurisaru said the game had been an ideal shakedown before  more difficult matches against Bay of Plenty and the New Zealand Maoris.
