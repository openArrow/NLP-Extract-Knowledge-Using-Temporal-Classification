Japan's Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister  Mutsuki Kato denied a news report Tuesday that Tokyo had reached secret  bilateral milk product import agreements with Australia and the United States.
The report by the Japanese daily Asahi newspaper said the accords were  reached in the face of import liberalization under the GATT-sponsored Uruguay  Round of world trade talks.
Kato, quoted by Kyodo News Service, told reporters that Japan was  negotiating with the United States and Australia on the level of butter, skim  milk and other milk product imports.
But talks do not concern country-by-country accords, which are banned by  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Kato said.
Japan has no secret deals and has offered no guarantees on milk product  imports, Kato said.
The minister said Japan would inform GATT on the content of the  negotiations with Australia and the United States.
