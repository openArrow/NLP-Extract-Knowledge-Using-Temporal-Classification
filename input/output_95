Israeli officials handed over  at least three buildings to Palestinian police officers in the early hours of  Friday as a small crowd of residents who had stayed up all night cheered on.
The Israeli flag was lowered and replaced by the Palestinian flag at the  central police station, the post office and a court house, witnesses said.
The sites were transferred formally to some 20 officers who had crossed  over from Jordan on Thursday.
Another 40 officers and 386 policemen, formerly based in Iraq, are due to  follow on Friday, as the Israelis relinquish control of the West Bank town to  the Palestinians under the autonomy deal signed on May 4.
"If all goes well, all the Jericho region will be in Palestinian hands by  Friday afternoon," said Colonel Herzl, a member of the Israeli-Palestinian  military liaison commmittee, whose full name was withheld for security  reasons.
"I didn't expect them to hand over the sites this quiet way," said  taxi-driver Attia Barham, 40.
"But there have been so many changes in plans that I'm not surprised.
"The Israelis saw how happy we were and didn't want to let us rejoice," he  said, referring to the discreet way the officers were let in to the region.
