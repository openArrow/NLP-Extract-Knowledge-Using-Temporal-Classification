The Moslem fundamentalist group HAMAS on Monday  refused to hand over militants who killed two suspected collaborators in Gaza  to the Palestinian police.
It charged that the two men had been "planning to assassinate HAMAS and  Fatah leaders to stir up trouble and provoke fighting" between the  fundamentalists and the PLO's main group.
"We refuse to hand over our militants and hope that the Palestinian police  can carry out its role of pursuing collaborators. If so, it will save HAMAS  having to do it," the group said in a statement released in Damascus.
It warned police chief Nassr Yussef to handle "this delicate situation"  with care "so as not to provoke reactions which would not be in the interests  of our people and their unity."
On the autonomous Gaza Strip, Yussef issued a stern warning to Islamic  fundamentalists after HAMAS executed the two suspects on Friday and demanded  that the killers be handed over.
HAMAS announced Sunday it would stop killing collaborators, but only  temporarily to see if the police could do its job.
Almost 1,000 Palestinians have been murdered by fellow Palestinians since  the intifada erupted in December 1987, but Israel maintains that fewer than 40  percent were collaborators.
