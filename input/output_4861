A former state legislator, his son  and a police officer were mowed down in a hail of gunfire as police attempted  to take the son into custody Friday.
The shootout began when five officers accompanied by former Republican  state senator Joe Mercer, 57, approached Mercer's son Stephen at his home.  Authorities were attempting to take Stephen into custody for a mental  evaluation.
Stephen, 30, had been involved in a seven-hour stand off with police the  previous week and had held police off for 45 minutes on Thursday.
As the officers attempted to speak with Stephen Friday he pulled out a gun  and shot Lieutenant Bill Sibrava of the Sheriff's Department. Joe Mercer was  caught in the cross fire that erupted between the officers and his son.
Stephen died at the scene. His father and Sibrava died in the hospital.
Joe Mercer was in the New Mexico state Senate from 1977 to 1984. He had  also served in the state House of Representatives in 1975 and 1976.
