Butch Reynolds lost the 27.4 million  dollars in damages awarded against the athletics establishment here on Tuesday  when a court upheld the International Amateur Athletic Federation's appeal.
The Cincinnati court of appeal ruled that judge Joseph Kinneary had not  been in his right to award damages against the IAAF in December, 1992.
Reynolds, 400m world record holder, has always maintained he was the  victim of a bungled drugs test for anabolic steroids at Monaco in 1990 which  led to a two-year ban.
"There's no way an international organization should be able to come in  here and disgrace a citizen of the United States," the athlete said when he  announced he was appealing to the state supreme court.
Reynolds won a tortuous legal battle to force the IAAF to let him run  again and he won the world championship silver medal at Stuttgart in Germany  last year.
IAAF president Primo Nebiolo said the verdict was important for the  sporting world which had feared a spate of lawsuits arising from contested  drugs tests at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
