Dozens of pilgrims were killed in a  stampede late Monday at the Moslem holy site here, witnesses said.
No official confirmation was immediately available of the tragedy, and the  witnesses, who would not be identified, said they did not know how it occurred.
They said pilgrims had been trampled to death and bodies littered the  site, while religious ceremonies were taking place. Saudi security forces were  at the scene but ambulances had been temporarily barred from access.
The incident occurred as the Saudi authorities were proclaiming the  successful completion of this year's pilgrimage, in which more than two  million Moslems took part.
In July 1990 more than 1,400 people were killed in a panic-stricken  stampede in a tunnel near here.
