A French government minister back from a tour of  central Africa, said Sunday that the United Nations should urgently despatch  troops to war-torn Rwanda and set up safe havens for civilians.
Junior health minister Philippe Douste-Blazy said there was "an urgent  need" for the Security Council to implement without delay its resolution  calling for 5,500 "blue helmets" to be deployed in Rwanda.
UN safe havens "humanitarian zones"  should be created in various parts of  the country where at least 200,000 people are estimated to have died in six  weeks of ethnic bloodletting, he told AFP at the airport.
"Putting thousands of UN troops between the two sides is not enough," he  said referring to battling government forces dominated by ethnic Hutus and the  mainly rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front who are mainly from the Tutsi  minority.
He said the UN troops should be deployed across the country "to avoid the  massacres carried out by members of the (Hutu) militia".
Douste-Blazy said there was also a need to prevent Hutu-Tutsi bloodshed in  Burundi where hundreds of thousands of Rwandans have taken refuge.
He said the bloodbath in Rwanda was the "biggest massacre of the final  years of this century" in which ethnic genocide had spared not even the  children.
Douste-Blazy visited Rwandan refugees Thursday at Ngara in Tanzania,  Friday at Kirundo in Burundi and Saturday at the Rwanda-Burundi border where  the the first World Emergency Medical Service was set up.
Fighting at the airport in Kigali meanwhile caused the United Nations to  postpone flights to prepare the arrival of UN reinforcements.
The international community "must hurry"  Douste-Blazy said.
