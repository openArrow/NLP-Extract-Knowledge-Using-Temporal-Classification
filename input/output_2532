higher. The price of silver climbed 20 cents to end the week at  above 5.6 dollars per ounce, as investment funds, notably from the United  States, showed renewed interest in the metal, pushing prices to their highest  level since the beginning of April.
PLATINUM: higher. The price of platinum rose to levels attained prior to  the South African election, when dealers feared a cut in production. Prices  gained on large-scale buying from Asia.
The annual report from Johnson Matthey predicted the use of platinum in  catalytic converters would rise around nine percent this year, compared with  1993, representing almost half the usage of the metal.
Johnson Matthey said the price would be relatively firm around 400 dollars  per ounce for the rest of the year, on increased industrial demand and on the  political situation in Russia and South Africa, the world's two largest  producers.
COPPER: soaring higher. The price of copper soared higher all week,  reaching its highest closing rate since December 1992 Thursday at 2,252  dollars per tonne.
Dealers said that although Thursday's highs were speculative, copper had  very firm fundamentals with regular drawdowns in stocks and expected increases  in demand in Europe and the United States.
On a downward note, dealers said the biggest threat to the copper market  was its own price, with some traders noting that US consumer demand was  steadying.
They said it was also worth noting that the use of copper pipe in the  construction sector was coming under increasing threat from plastic  substitutes.
In the British house building boom of the late 1980s plastic flexible pipe  had just made inroads into the market, but the current rise in raw material  costs could impact on copper wire consumption, traders at GNI said.
