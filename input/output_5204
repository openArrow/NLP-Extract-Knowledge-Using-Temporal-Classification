Defending women's champion Steffi Graf and  19-year-old French rival Mary Pierce took the TGV to travel into the second  week of the French Open here on Sunday.
But world number-one Pete Sampras found himself uncomfortably blocked in  the slow lane as he fought to keep his 'Grand Slam' dream on the rails.
Graf and Pierce, heading for what could be one of the most explosive  semi-final showdowns at the Championship in years, dropped only three games  between them.
Irina Spirlea, the girl they were calling the 'new Steffi Graf' earlier  this week, crashed to a humiliating 0-6, 1-6 defeat when she came up against  the real thing. The defending champion gave the 20-year-old, 41st-ranked  Romanian a 40-minute tennis lesson which reset the alarm bells ringing in the  camps of her rivals.
Meanwhile the 19-year-old Pierce, who has dropped only four games in as  many matches since the Championships began last Monday, spent just 63 minutes  disposing of 18th-ranked Amanda Coetzer of South Africa 6-1, 6-1.
In the other half of the women's draw second-seed Arantxa Sanchez and  Spanish compatriot Conchita Martinez continued their march towards a meeting  in the other semi-final.
Neither have dropped a set at the tournament so far.
Sanchez, who got up unhurt from a spectacular fall to move closer to  recapturing the title she first won as a 17-year-old in 1989 by beating  Germany's Anke Huber, said: "I was really worried when I rolled over and my  arm was pinned behind me. But when I was able to pick up my racket I knew  everything would be all right."
The centre-court spill came in the seventh game of the second-set as  Sanchez charged through 6-3, 6-2.
Martinez outlasted French wild-card entry Alexia Dechaume-Balleret 6-1,  6-2.
