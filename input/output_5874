A second top official of the far-right Republicans  party has quit, accusing its former Waffen SS leader Franz Schoenhuber of  failing to distance himself from neo-Nazi ideas.
Udo Boesch, responsible for party organisation, announced he was resigning  in a letter published Tuesday, two weeks after national secretary Martina  Rosenberger left the Republicans citing similar reasons.
The party responded immediately by saying that Boesch had been a secret  agent of the German state intelligence.
In a television interview Boesch, a former army lieutenant-colonel, also  accused the party leadership of failing to stem anti-semitism in its ranks.
Schoenhuber, who recently caused outcry by saying the leader of the German  Jewish community, Ignatz Bubis, was the country's worst inciter of hatred, is  a member of the European parliament.
The Republicans, Germany's strongest far-right party, are developing into  an extreme-right movement, according to the domestic intelligence service  which distinguishes between the far-right and the neo-Nazi extreme right.
The party claimed 23,000 members at the end of 1993 and has elected  representatives on several local councils and in the Baden Wuerttemberg  regional parliament as well as Schoenhuber in the Strasbourg assembly.
