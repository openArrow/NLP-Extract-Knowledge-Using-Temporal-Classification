The Societe Le Nickel (SLN) Thursday inaugurated a  new mine that is expected to help rank New Caledonia as one of the world's  largest nickel producers.
The Kopeto 2 mine, 250 kilometers (155 miles) outside of Noumea, is  expected to produce 17,000 tonnes of nickel per year for 15 years and to  supply one third of the requirements of the SLN's refinery in Noumea, the only  one in the territory.
The SLN currently produces 50,000 tonnes of nickel per year, or eight  percent of the nickel on the western market.
New Caledonia possesses 20 to 25 percent of the world's known nickel  reserves.
The other major nickel producers are Russia, Canada, Indonesia and  Australia.
