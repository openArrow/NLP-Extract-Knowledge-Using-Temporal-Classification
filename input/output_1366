Some 50 Russian airline pilots picketed the state  parliament Tuesday on the eve of a threatened strike to protest deteriorating  work conditions and to demand better safety regulations.
The pilots, who have threatened to go on strike from Wednesday, carried  banners reading: "Russian passengers, you are the most courageous in the  world."
Their union leaders said a final decision on whether to strike would be  taken overnight.
Russian Transport Minister Vitaly Yefimov meanwhile said at a press  conference he did not believe the strike call would be generally heeded as  "the air carriers would then risk losing a lot of money."
Yefimov also played down the pilots' fears over safety standards, fears  echoed by foreign experts. "The aviation security system remains under state  control, even though there are several companies," since the break-up of  Soviet carrier Aeroflot.
"Perhaps Russian pilots are afraid in the sky over Africa," Yefimov  continued, but they don't need to be afraid in Russian airspace."
But he conceded in documents published Tuesday that the number of deaths  per million passengers rose from 3.5 per million in 1992 to 5.5 in 1993. A  total of 212 people died in air accidents in Russia in 1992, with the figure  rising to 221 in 1993, the minister said.
