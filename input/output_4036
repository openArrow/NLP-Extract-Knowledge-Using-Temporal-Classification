Maxi Merit Cup headed the  Whitbread around-the-world fleet out of the Gulf Stream as it built on its  sixth-leg lead on Wednesday.
The Swiss entry, skippered by Pierre Fehlmann, carved out a 151 nautical  mile lead over arch-rival New Zealand Endeavour by 15.20 GMT, threatening the  Kiwi yacht's overall lead of 18 hours in the maxi class.
Merit Cup was recording a speed of 15.3 knots to Endeavour's 11.9.
Italian Whitbread 60, meanwhile, had forged 62 miles clear of nearest  challenger Galicia 93 Pescanova, with overall leader Yamaha another 64 miles  adrift.
The closest threat to Yamaha at the start of the leg, Instrum Justitia  skippered by Lawrie Smith, gained ground overnight despite dropping two  placings.
Yamaha skipper Ross Field predicted: "I reckon we could be in these Gulf  Stream conditions for up to another three days so I'm not concerned about  those boasts way out to the east.
"We've go the current with us and they haven't -- so we could well be  ahead of Brooksfield in a couple of days.
"But that doesn't concern up. We're covering Instrum Justitia and during  the last three hours we've put another mile on them."
