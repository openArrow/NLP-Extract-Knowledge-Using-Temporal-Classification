A controversial black Islamic  speaker and three other people were shot Sunday following a speech on a  California campus, authorities said.
Khallid Muhammad was not seriously injured according to police, who had to  pull the crowd off the gunman after he opened fire in the University of  California, Riverside, parking lot.
One of the three other people hit was in critical condition, according to  KTTV television, and two people were injured in a scuffle when the crowd began  beating the black gunman, shouting "He works for the Jews."
Muhammad, 43, was suspended from his duties as a senior aide to Nation of  Islam leader Louis Farrakhan after a speech in November in which he called  Jews "the bloodsuckers of the black nation and the black community."
Muhammad spoke Sunday in south-central Los Angeles, the site of violent  demonstrations in 1991 that erupted following the acquittal of white police  officers charged in the beating of black motorist Rodney King.
Muhammad warned the handful of white listeners that his speech would be "a  rough ride" and proceeded again to attack Jews.
"The black holocaust is 100 times worse than any other holocaust ever  recorded in the annals of time," he declared, adding that the Jews had  infiltrated the civil rights movement to pursue their own interests.
Farrakhan has denounced Muhammad as an anti-semite, as has President Bill  Clinton and Jewish leaders.
