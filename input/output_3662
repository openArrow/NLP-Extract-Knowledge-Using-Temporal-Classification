Japanese men and women come out tops for life  expectancy in the World Health Organisation's latest annual statistics for  last year, published Tuesday.
In 1993, Japanese women lived to an average 83 years, ahead of their  counterparts in France (82), Switzerland (81.7), Canada (81) and Australia  (80.8).
Japanese men had an average life expectancy of 76.3 years, against 75.1  for their counterparts in Israel, Sweden (74.9), Australia (74.8) and Greece  (74.7).
"The world health statistics annual presents detailed statistical  information useful in monitoring trends in health status and causes of death,"  explained Hubert Dixon of the WHO's division of epidemiological surveillance.
WHO spokesman Michel Barton said it was the third year running the  Japanese had topped the list for longevity.
For the first time the document also included data on the new independent  states of the former Soviet Union. Countries with populations of less than  500,000 were not included in the survey.
Japan also has the lowest rate of infant mortality -- just 4.5 per 1,000  children dying in infancy, according to the WHO. Finland was next best with a  rate of 5.2 per 1,000, followed by Singapore (5.4).
Brazil had the worst reported figure of 32.5 infant deaths per 1,000.
