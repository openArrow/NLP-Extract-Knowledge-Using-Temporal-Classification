Russian Patriarch Aleksy II arrived Tuesday in  Pale, capital of the Bosnian Serbs near Sarajevo, on a peace mission to unite  Bosnia's warring factions, the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA reported.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, whom the patriarch met on arrival,  said the visit was a "great day" for the Bosnian Serbs after Aleksy II arrived  from Belgrade, where he had Monday met Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
"If we can make some contribution to reinforcing peace in the region we  will be very satisfied," the Belgrade daily had earlier quoted Aleksy II as  saying.
But his mediation attempt was cold-shouldered by the leader of the Bosnian  Moslem community, Mustafa Ceric.
The Bosnian embassy in Zagreb said Ceric had rejected the partiarch's  invitation to attend peace talks with the leaders of the country's three  communities "because he does not wish to meet the head of a church which  supports aggression."
In contrast, the primate of the Catholic Church in Croatia, Cardinal  Franjo Kuharic, did accept the invitation to meet the patriarch at Sarajevo  airport.
Aleksy II was also scheduled to visit Russian UN troops based at Grbavica,  a Serb-held district of Sarajevo before returning to Belgrade in the evening.
The Russians have been traditional allies of the Serbs who are fellow  orthodox Christians and Slavs.
