Two German states Tuesday suspended for six  months the deportation of Kurdish asylum-seekers because of the volatile  situation in southeastern Turkey, officials said.
The decision, announced by the interior ministers of Schleswig-Holstein  and Rhineland-Palatinate, was the first such move to date and affects Kurds  from southeast Anatolia. But Schleswig-Holstein's Interior Minister Peter Bull  said it did not include those who had committed criminal offences.
His Rhineland-Palatinate colleague Walter Zuber said the move in  particular covered members of the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party, banned  in both Turkey and Germany.
Bull, whose state is governed by the Social Democrats, in opposition in  Bonn, called on other states to follow suit. He reminded them the situation in  Kurdish regions of Turkey remained very tense amid clashes between Kurdish  separatists and security forces.
He indicated Germany should introduce the long-term suspension of  deportations at the national level as the human rights situation in Anatolia  was unlikely to improve in the forseeable future.
However, state interior ministers refused to halt the expulsions at their  last meeting on May 6.
Several hundred Kurds face prosecution for violent demonstrations which  took place in Germany on March 21, when Kurds celebrated their new year.  Bavarian authorities have already said they intend to expel some 20 people  involved in those clashes.
