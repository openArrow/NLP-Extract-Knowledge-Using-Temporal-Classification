Northern troops on Monday captured the south's main  air base of Al-Anad which controls a key highway leading to the southern  stronghold of Aden, the official Yemeni news agency Saba said.
The agency, run by the north, said Saleh's troops were "mopping up the  last pockets of the rebel forces in Al-Anad base," around 60 kilometres (35  miles) north of the port city.
"A unit of the (south's) 22nd brigade and around 100 members of the  special guard of Ali Salem al-Baid surrendered to the forces of unity and  legality," it said, quoting military sources.
More than 20,000 soldiers loyal to Baid, the vice president and bitter  rival of President Ali Abdallah Saleh, were deployed in the base, according to  southern military officials.
