Four more seeds were blown away at the French Open  Tennis Championships here on Friday as wintry weather invaded the famous  Roland Garros Stadium to the west of the capital.
Two promising newcomers in the women's game emerged to upset the  establishment, Steffi Graf went to sleep and dropped a set, and French  teenager Mary Pierce was given a standing ovation as she continued to  steamroller her way through the draw.
Mary Joe Fernandez, last year's finalist and seeded tenth, was frogmarched  out of the event by Romania's 20-year-old Irina Spirlea.
And experienced 29-year-old Helena Sukova also made a third-round exit  when she went down in two tie-breaks to Ines Gorrochategui -- a girl nine  years her junior who is being hailed as the new Gabriela Sabatini.
In the men's singles, exciting 'serve-and-volley' player Patrick Rafter of  Australia played the best match of his life on clay to eliminate tough  Austrian eleventh-seed Thomas Muster in four sets.
And Swedish qualifier Mikael Tillstrom continued his fairy-tale run in his  first-ever Grand Slam appearance by beating sixteenth-seed Richard Krajicek.
Fernandez suffered her nightmare on the same centre-court where she had  taken a set off Graf in last year's final.
She said after a 70-minute 4-6, 1-6 humiliation by Spirlea: "She reminds  me a bit of Steffi Graf. She likes to run round her backhand and hit  forehands, and she is a very, very good athlete."
The fans will be able to judge for themselves in the next round.
The Romanian, who was making only her second appearance at the  Championships after a first-round defeat two years ago, now plays the German  for a place in the quarter-finals.
