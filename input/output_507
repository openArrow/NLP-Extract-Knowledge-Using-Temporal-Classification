American John David Jackson was stripped of his WBA  middleweight world crown here on Saturday for fighting a bout without official  permission.
WBA committee president Elias Cordova said the title was now vacant and  would go to the winner of a fight between American Beggie Johnson and Jorge  Castro of Argentina.
He claimed Jackson, who won the title on October 1 last year, fought a  10-round bout on May 6 against compatriot Jess Johnson without clearance.
