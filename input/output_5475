Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree on  Monday extending a state of emergency to the border area between the breakaway  republic of Chechnya and neighbouring Ingushetia.
Chechnya, a tiny Russian republic which declared its independence from  Moscow in 1991, warned on Thursday that any such move "will be considered by  Chechnya as an act of military aggression."
Authorities in the breakaway Caucasus republic earlier Monday accused the  Russian secret service of staging an assassination attempt last Friday on  President Dzhokhar Dudayev. Moscow denied the allegations.
