The main pilots' union here called on Russia's  40,000 pilots to observe a general strike from Wednesday to protest at  deteriorating safety standards and poor retirement benefits, the union's  leader said Monday.
Eduard Bychkov said the union had asked the government during its congress  in February to deal with its demands by May 18 or face a nationwide unlimited  strike.
The transport ministry, which has forwarded the pilots' demands to  parliament, is hoping to negotiate a last-minute deal to avert the strike, the  ministry's press office said.
The pilots plan to demonstrate in front of the parliament building Tuesday.
"As pilots responsible for safety, we have come to the limit of what is  acceptable," Valentin Presnyakov, a pilot, was quoted as saying in the Moscow  Times. "If things continue to deteriorate, we will personally be afraid to  fly."
Air crashes have been on the rise here since the demise of the Soviet  Union, and western experts have noted deteriorating safety procedures at  Aeroflot and other airlines now operating in the former Soviet Union.
The latest crash was on March 23 when an airliner came down in Siberia  killing 75 people.
Several transport officials have said that flight recorders showed that  the pilot's son had been at the plane's controls when it crashed.
