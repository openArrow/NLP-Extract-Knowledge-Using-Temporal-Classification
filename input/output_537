After collecting the Cup Bruce said: "This is a fantastic achievement by  the club. The players deserve credit and what can you say about our gaffer  Alex Ferguson? He has done everything. But I don't think we deserved to win  4-0. We didn't play that well."
Ferguson's thoughts in triumph immediately turned to Old Trafford  patriarch Sir Matt Busby, who died earlier this year. He said: "Sir Matt would  have been very proud of the players if he could have been here today.
"In the first half Chelsea caused us a lot of problems but at half-time we  spoke of the need to get Ryan Giggs and Andrei Kanchelskis operating from wide  positions and after the break we spread the game out."
Ferguson, asked if he was disappointed to miss out on an unprecedented  treble because of United's League Cup Final defeat, replied: "Disappointed? I  will be happy with the double every year."
United romped to victory after Chelsea had hit their crossbar, Eric  Cantona tucking away two penalties.
Chelsea player-boss Glenn Hoddle said: "It all turned on our shot against  the crossbar and then the penalties. We have seen all season that once  Manchester United go in front, they are virtually unstoppable.
"We are dejected. We don't like losing but I was pleased with the way we  played. Once United were ahead, we were always chasing the game and leaving  gaps at the back. United had too much skill to let us get away with that."
