Laura Tyson, President Bill Clinton's chief economic  adviser, was elected to chair the OECD's Economic Policy Committee (EPC) for  the next 12 months, on Thursday.
The committee, composed of top-level national policy-makers, elected the  vice minister of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, Tsutomu Tanaka, and British  Treasury chief economic adviser Alan Budd as vice chairmen.
The 25-nation panel meets twice annually to review economic trends and  their implications for national and international economic and monetary  policies, as part of a multilateral policy coordination process.
The committee elected another US official, Treasury Under Secretary for  International Affairs Larry Summers, as chairman of its secrecy-shrouded  Working Party No. 3 (WP3).
The 10-member WP3, which reviews the international payments adjustment  process and the coordination of monetary, fiscal and exchange rate policies,  normally meets at least three times a year and generally avoids any publicity  around its discussions.
The EPC reelected top Norwegian finance ministry official Thorvald Moe as  chairman of its Working Party No. 1, which concentrates on medium-term  macro-economic and structural issues, and picked R. Shogren, a senior  Australian treasury official, as its vice-chairman.
The WP1 has in the past two years been deeply involved in work on an  in-depth OECD study of employment and unemployment, and policies needed to get  the jobless back to work. The study, ordered by the OECD's 1992 annual  ministerial meeting, is to be presented to this year's ministerial, scheduled  for June 7-8.
