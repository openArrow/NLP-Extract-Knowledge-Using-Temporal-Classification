The French Atomic Energy Comission (CEA) on Monday  announced a breakthrough in physics with the discovery of the fifth and  heaviest of the so-called "double magic nuclei", an isotope of tin.
The isotope, known as tin 100, contains 50 protons and 50 neutrons, which  makes it an unusually stable element.
Only four previous "magic" isotopes with equal numbers of protons and  neutrons had been discovered: helium 4, oxygen 16, calcium 40 and nickel 56.
The breakthrough, at the national large accelerator of heavy ions -- known  by its French acronym GANIL -- in the western French town of Caen, came after  25 years of research and resulted from cooperation between teams from Belgium,  France, Germany, Poland, Romania and Russia.
The find, made between April 22 and 29, should help scientists to  determine the substance's properties and improve existing theoretical nuclear  models examining the nature of elements constituting the universe, the  research centre said in a statement.
