The European Union officially lifted its last  sanctions against South Africa on Friday, in particular its ban on arms trade  with the country, a statement said.
The move, which also includes a lifting of the ban on military  cooperation, comes after the election of Nelson Mandela as president in the  country's first all-race ballots.
The announcement comes after the UN Security Council voted unanimously  Wednesday to put an immediate end to the 17-year-old mandatory UN arms embargo  on South Africa.
