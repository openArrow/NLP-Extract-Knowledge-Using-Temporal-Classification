Former finance minister Hans Apel was named Sunday  to spearhead efforts to find a new partner for the giant eastern German EKO  Stahl steelworks, after an embarassing last-minute withdrawal by the Italian  industrial group Riva.
"We have a difficult road ahead of us," Birgit Breuel, president of the  Treuhand statea privatisation agency, admitted Sunday. "We need a solid  industrial partner and we are going to try to find one as soon as possible."
Breuel, speaking after a meeting of the company's management, unions and  regional and federal politicians, underlined the commitment of all parties "to  do everything to guarantee the company's profitability," including job cuts.
Riva announced Friday that it was cancelling plans to buy out EKO Stahl, a  key employer in the depressed eastern German region of Eisenhuettenstadt,  embarrassing the Kohl government ahead of October elections.
The deal, worth 1.1 billion German marks (700,000 dollars), would have  been one of the most ambitious privatisation projects in the former communist  east.
Apel was at the centre of a dispute between Riva and and the powerful IG  Metall union which led to the pull-out, as the Italian company refused to  accept him as a neutral member of the company's supervisory council.
The deal also came unstuck over the pace of job cuts, which would bring  staffing down from 3,000 to 2,300, and union questions about Riva's soundness.
On Sunday evening, regional premier Manfred Stolpe said Riva's pull-out  was prompted by domestic "Italian reasons", as the company wanted to buy two  steel works in Italy.
