Steffi Graf will meet Brenda Schultz in the final  of the German Open on Sunday after both players enjoyed straight set victories  in glorious sunshine.
Top seed Graf, who has won the event in seven of the last eight years,  defeated third seed Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic 6-2 6-3, while Schultz  of Holland reached her second final of the year with a 7-6 (8/6) 6-3 upset  over seventh seed Anke Huber.
Germany's Graf looked far more positive than she had against Julie Halard  in the quarter-finals. She mixed up her game, confusing Novotna with a  selection of dropshots, lobs, driving forehands and sliced backhands.
Novotna, who received treatment for an ankle injury in the fourth game,  had plenty of good ideas of her own, but failed to execute them with the same  efficiency.
She often underhit the ball or was passed as she came in, and was also  forced into errors when Graf added pace to the ball.
Graf set the tone by breaking serve for 2-1, and Novotna netted a forehand  to go down 4-1. Graf then held three set points at 5-1, but Novotna escaped  first with a backhand pass and then two Graf errors.
Graf finally took the 1st set with a crosscourt forehand, but fell behind  0-2 in the 2nd set as Novotna staged a brief revival. But Graf broke back in  the next game and always looked comfortable from that point on.
Novotna gave full credit to Graf, but blamed a slippery court for most of  her problems.
"I played smartly, but it's very hard to do something when you're slipping  and sliding all over the place" she moaned.
"If I needed to come in I had no grip. It's not my shoes. I think I have  the best shoes I can have. Everyone has complained about the court all week  but they did nothing. If you have ideas and can't get there because of the  court it's very upsetting."
