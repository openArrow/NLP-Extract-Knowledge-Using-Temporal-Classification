UN special envoy Iqbal Riza left the Rwandan  capital Kigali Thursday to meet with rebel leaders in their northern  stronghold of Mulindi, an official with the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda  (UNAMIR) said.
The official, reached by telephone from Nairobi, said the situation in  Kigali was relatively calm Thursday following fierce fighting on Wednesday  between the mainly Tutsi rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and mainly Hutu  government forces.
Riza on Wednesday met with members of the country's all-Hutu interim  government, which was proclaimed after the April 6 death of president Juvenal  Habyarimana unleashed a tide of ethnic slaughter in which up to 500,000  Rwandans, mostly minority Tutsis and Hutu opposition supporters, have been  butchered.
Earlier this week Riza also met with rebel leaders in their headquarters  in Mulindi and with government military officials in Kigali in an attempt to  broker a ceasefire that would allow the return of peacekeepers.
Riza is trying to persuade the rebels to drop their demand for the United  Nations to cut its planned 5,500-strong force to 2,500.
The rebels, who according to UN military officials are poised to flush  battered and demoralised government soldiers out of Kigali, seem concerned  that UN peacekeepers might arrive before they have had time to rout the army.
They have also complained that Riza's meeting with the government, which  has withdrawn to Gitarama, 40 kilometres (25 miles) southwest of Kigali, would  lend it legitimacy, but the United Nations stressed that the talks "do not  constitute recognition of the government."
