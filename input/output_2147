Monica Seles has demanded 10 million  dollars from the German Tennis Federation for losses caused by the knife  attack at a Hamburg tournament from which she has yet to return to pro tennis.
The German lawyer for Seles, the world number one at the time of the  attack on April 30, 1993, has written the federation citing examples of  inadequate security at the Citizen Cup event.
"We are not indicating insufficient security at sporting events in  general," lawyer Wilhelm Danelzik said in the letter, which was released by  Seles' agents International Management Group on Thursday.
"There was gross negligence on the part of the organizers of the Citizen  Cup, which resulted in the attack and serious injury on Miss Seles, and that  attack could have been prevented by adequate security measures."
Danelzik said his next step on behalf of Seles would depend on the respone  of the German Tennis Federation.
The amount demanded includes loss of prize money and loss of endorsement  earnings. Seles has won eight Grand Slam titles and earned 7.4 million dollars  in tournament prize money since she turned pro in February of 1989.
Seles, 20, also said she is appealing the sentence of her attacker,  Gunther Parche, who was released on probation without serving any time in jail.
She said his release was particularly upsetting to her as she tried to  come to grips with the emotional effects of the attack.
"I am trying very hard to overcome the impact of the stabbing," she said.  "I have always loved playing tennis, and it is very difficult for me not to be  able to live the life I always thought I would live."
Seles' father and coach Karolj added: "Monica has not been able to  overcome the emotional impact of the knife attack, which continues to be a  problem for her.
"Monica wishes she could have been playing on the tennis tour by now, but  she is unable to do so ... Unfortunately, Monica is not ready or able to go  back to tournament play at this time."
