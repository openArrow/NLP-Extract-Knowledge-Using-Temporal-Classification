Shanghai is set to record its second consecutive  year of negative population growth, the Xinhua news agency said Monday,  attributing the trend to changing social priorities.
China's most populous city, Shanghai became the first to record a negative  population growth last year with a birth rate of 6.5 per thousand and a death  rate of 7.5 per thousand.
The number of new-born babies is predicted to total 81,000 this year,  compared to 84,000 in 1993 -- the lowest in the eastern city's history.
Shanghai's population stands at 13.49 million, according to a recent  survey by the municipal statistical bureau.
The average marrying age for Shanghainese is 28.8 for men and 26.8 for  women -- three years later in both cases compared to a decade ago -- while  many couples are delaying starting a family to concentrate on their work.
Attitudes towards child-rearing have also changed markedly, with 85  percent of couples supporting China's strict one-child policy, and one-third  of them not caring whether they have a boy or a girl.
Some 92 percent of Shanghai couples use contraception, compared to the  national figure of 72 percent.
According to one 36-year-old dentist quoted by the survey, the new  pressures of China's market economy simply do not leave time for a family.
"My home is far fom the work place and I feel tired after a day's work,"  the dentist said.
"I cannot spare the time for raising a child."
