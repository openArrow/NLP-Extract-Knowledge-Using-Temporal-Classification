Palestinian gunmen shot dead two Israelis and  seriously wounded another in an ambush south of the West Bank town of Hebron  on Tuesday, military officials said.
The killers lay in wait by the roadside near the Jewish settlement of  Haggai, south of Hebron, and opened fire on a passing car.
A man and a woman died and another man was injured. It was not immediately  clear if the casualties were settlers.
The army closed off the area and began a manhunt.
It was the first killing of Israelis since Israel and the PLO signed an  agreeement on May 4 to implement autonomy in the Gaza Strip on the West Bank  town of Jericho.
Avi Mar Yosef, secretary at Haggai, said: "The attack took place just 100  metres south of the settlement."
The casualties were taken to a Jerusalem hospital by helicopter, he told  Israel state radio.
Seventeen Palestinians were wounded in clashes with Israeli settlers and  troops on Monday in Hebron, which has remained a flashpoint since the February   25 massacre of 30 Moslems by a Jewish colonist.
There have been several attacks on Israelis on the Gaza Strip in recent  days and a Jewish lorry driver was seriously wounded near the settlement of  Morag on Thursday when Islamic fundamentalists opened fire.
The fundamentalists of the Islamic Resistance Movement HAMAS have vowed to  fight on against Israeli occupation despite the autonomy deal.
The last killing of an Israeli dated back to April 21 when a soldier's  dead body was found in East Jerusalem.
The latest deaths brought to 224 the number of Israelis murdered by  Palestinians since the start of the intifada or uprising in December 1987,  according to an AFP toll.
