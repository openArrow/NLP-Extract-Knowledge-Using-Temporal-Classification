More than 50 armed riot police were deployed around  the Saudi embassy in Tehran on Wednesday amid a row between the two countries  over a ban on an anti-US rally in Mecca, an AFP correspondent reported.
A police officer at the scene told AFP that the move was taken at the  request of Saudi authorities to protect the embassy amid mounting tension  between the two countries.
The police took up positions around the embassy and set up road blocks on  streets leading to the building.
Iran called off an anti-US and anti-Israel demonstration, planned to be  held by Iranian pilgrims in Mecca on Tuesday, under the threat of force from  the Saudis.
