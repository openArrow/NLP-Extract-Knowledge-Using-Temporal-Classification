North Korea has decided not to take part in team  competitions in the Asian Games in Hiroshima this October, the organising  committee said Wednesday.
North Korea, absent from major international sporting events for a year,  has yet to decide whether to compete in individual events.
The hardline communist state, strapped for cash and isolated by its  suspected nuclear arms programme, boycotted the 1986 Asian Games held in the  South Korean capital of Seoul but went to the 1990 Games in Beijing.
