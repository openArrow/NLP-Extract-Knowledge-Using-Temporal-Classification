The Yemeni ambassador here locked himself inside his  embassy and shut out staff after he was recalled to Sanaa for supporting  southern forces in the country's civil war, a diplomat said.
Ambassador Abdel Galil Ghailan "refused to go back and retaliated by  shutting out all the staff and asking Egyptian security forces to protect  him," Mohammad Qaed, a northerner, said.
Qaed said all the embassy personnel were "loyal to the legitimate  government (in Sanaa) and reject the ambassador's authority." They were  waiting outside the building to go back to work, he added.
Ghailan's residence is located inside the embassy, and it was not possible  to reach him for comment.
A diplomatic attache told the Egyptian news agency MENA that Ghailan had  locked the embassy after grabbing the keys from a guard and throwing him out  of the building before staff returned from a four-day holiday.
A northerner, Abd-al-Malik, was named as Ghailan's replacement, according  to MENA monitored by the BBC. Ghailan was appointed ambassador to Egypt soon  after the merger of the former South and North Yemen in May 1990.
Civil war broke out on May 5 between southern forces loyal to Vice  President Ali Salem al-Baid and those backing President Ali Abdallah Saleh.  Baid was named president of an independent state proclaimed in the south on  Saturday.
