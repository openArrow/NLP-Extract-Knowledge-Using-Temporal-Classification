Haiti's caretaker prime minister, Robert  Malval, urged government employees Monday to resist the authority of a  military-backed president sworn in last week.
"The outgoing government which represents constitutional legality is  hereby informing you that any instruction coming from him is null and that you  have the right and even the duty to ignore it," said Malval in a press  conference at his home here.
Malval also urged army chief, General Raoul Cedras, to resign. Cedras led  the September, 1991 coup that ousted president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Malval  was sworn in as a compromise prime minister as part of an agreement to bring  Aristide back.
Provisional president Emile Jonaissaint, formerly a Supreme Court justice,  named a government Monday
"The only legitimate government is my government until my constitutional  successor is named by president Jean-Bertrand Aristide and ratified by a  legitimate legislature," Malval said in a press conference at his home.
