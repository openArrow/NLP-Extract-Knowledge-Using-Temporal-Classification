Millions of locusts have descended on at least two  towns near Manila damaging agricultural crops and grounding air force planes  at a military base, officials said Wednesday.
Bureau of Plant Industry official Cecilio Diloy blamed the swarms on the  1991 eruption of Pinatubo volcano, which he said rendered large areas of  agricultural areas useless and encouraged breeding.
Officials at the Basa Air Base in Floridablanca town said air force jets  could not fly because of the risk of accidents by locusts being sucked into  their engines.
