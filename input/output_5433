Russia retargeted its missiles away from the United  States and Britain on Monday, in line with agreements signed earlier this year  with the two countries, the commander of Russian strategic rocket forces said.
General Igor Sergeyev was quoted by Interfax as saying that the nuclear  weapons were "de-targeted" and would not be aimed at any place on earth.
He added that the move would increase nuclear safety and would prevent an  unauthorised launch as the strategic missiles would not take off without a  flight program.
US President Bill Clinton signed the agreement on retargeting the missiles  with Russian President Boris Yeltsin during a summit meeting in January.
Britain joined the agreement on detargeting missiles on the territory of  the two countries in February.
Meanwhile, Russian Defence Minister General Pavel Grachev was quoted by  Interfax as saying that he wrote a letter to Yeltsin on May 25 in which he  informed him that the missiles were no longer targeted at the US and Britain.
The date of May 30 coincided with the timetable outlined in the bilateral  agreements on retargeting the missiles.
In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry said that "control over  nuclear forces by the Russian side would be based on the fact that the United  States and Britain are no longer enemies of Russia."
"This step reinforces international and bilateral security and is in line  with the new strategic partnership relations between the two countries and  their practical cooperation in the military and political fields."
