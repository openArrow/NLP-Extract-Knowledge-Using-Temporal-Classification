Hungary's former communists won an absolute  majority Sunday in run-off elections after four years of conservative rule,  the national election centre said.
Restyled as the Hungarian Socialist Party and led by Gyula Horn, the  foreign minister in the communist regime that fell in 1989, the former  communists were certain of getting 197 seats out of 386, with 99.92 percent of  the vote in, the centre said. An absolute majority is 194 seats.
It was the country's second democratic election since the fall of  communism.
The first one, held in March and April 1990, resulted in a coalition led  by the conservative Democratic Forum.
Hungary thus appears set to join Poland in shifting back to the left in  what is seen as a backlash against the pain of market-oriented economic reform.
Former communists dominated general elections in Poland in September of  last year.
