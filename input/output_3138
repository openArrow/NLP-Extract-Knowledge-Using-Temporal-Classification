Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller headed to the  United States on Monday for a private visit during which she plans to meet  with various American financial groups, Anatolia news agency reported.
Ciller, accompanied by her top advisor, Volkan Vural, and the deputy  governor of the Turkish Central Bank, Bilsel Alisbah, plans to travel to  Boston to meet with business leaders and to attend her son's graduation  Saturday from Mount Ida College.
Turkey is in the grip of a severe financial crisis -- the Turkish lira has  suffered a 150 percent depreciation against the dollar since January and the  12-month inflation rate to April hit 125 percent.
The government has adopted austerity measures and recently met with a  delegation from the International Monetary Fund in hopes of receiving about  450 million dollars in loans.
