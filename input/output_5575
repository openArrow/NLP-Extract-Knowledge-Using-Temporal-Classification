China is one of the biggest arms exporters  to the developing world and continues to spend billions on weapons despite its  own pressing social needs, according to a report published Wednesday.
"The arms business is one of the most reprehensible sectors of  international trade," said the Human Development Report 1994 prepared for the  UN Development Program.
"Arms traders have no compunction about making profits out of poverty --  selling sophisicated jet fighters or nuclear submarines to countries where  millions of people lack the most basic means of survival," said the report.
In addition to China, major suppliers to countries at war in the Third  World included Syria, Libya, Brazil and Egypt, according to the report.
The independent researchers who prepared the report noted that the top  five exporting countries which sell 86 percent of the arms exports to the  developing world Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States are all  permanent members of the UN Security Council.
"These weapons have not just wrought havoc within the buying countries,"  said the report, "They have also on occasion been turned against the soldiers  from the supplying nations -- as in recent conflicts involving Iraq and  Somalia."
The report also lists China as one of the developing countries which  squanders scarce funds on weapons rather than social needs, along with India,  Iran, South Korea, Malaysia, Nigeria and Pakistan.
"China purchased 26 combat aircraft from Russia in a deal whose total cost  could have provided safe water for one year to 140 million of the 200 million  people now without safe water," it notes.
The report urges continued cuts in military spending worldwide and calls  for an end to defense assistance funds to developing countries.
