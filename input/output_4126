The ruble fell two points Thursday against the U.S.  dollar and was quoted at 1,901 on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange,  against 1,899 Wednesday.
Volume of trade totalled 8.35 million dollars with initial demand of 54.4  million dollars and offers of 50.75 million dollars.
The ruble tumble -- which moved the currency closer to the psychological  threshold of 2,000 rubles to the greenback -- came after President Boris  Yeltsin ordered a major overhaul of his economic reform program in bid to stop  a drastic plunge in production.
In a series of decrees, Yeltsin scrapped export quotas and licences,  ordered tax cuts and threatened to place mismanaged enterprises under rigid  state control.
Statistics from the economic ministry revealed a 24.7 percent drop in  production in the first quarter compared to last year.
