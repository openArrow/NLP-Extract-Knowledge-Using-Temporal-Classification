A German company which organises summer language  courses for young Germans has asked families putting them up not to serve beef  to their guests, a spokesman said Friday.
Europartner said it feared that parents, worried by the German  government's campaign against British beef imports, would refuse to send their  children to Britain.
Bonn is concerned because bovine spongiform encephalopathy, so-called "mad  cow" disease, can be transmitted to man. The majority of cases in cattle have  been detected in Britain.
Several hundred families who regularly welcome students into their homes  in the summer holidays have received a letter to that effect.
"There is a lot of media coverage about mad cow disease in Germany at the  moment and many people are very nervous about it. There was a real concern  that there may be a mass cancellation of bookings, and Europartner has to  remain competitive" spokeswoman Jennie Parsons said.
The German authorities have threatened to take unilateral measures to  drastically limit imports of British beef unless the European Union reaches an  agreement on the problem by the end of May.
