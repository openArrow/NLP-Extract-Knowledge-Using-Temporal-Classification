Denmark has protested to the United Nations  about a refusal to provide close air support for the Nordic battalion under  attack by Bosnian Serbs at Tuzla airport this week, Defence Minister Hans  Haekkerup said here Thursday.
Ritzau news agency said he complained about "excuses and reservations"  among the UN Protection Force command in Bosnia which had occurred many times  in recent months.
"It is not for the fun of it that the Danish commanding officer on the  ground asks for NATO planes to intervene," Haekkerup said. "He is within his  rights to have that backing when the life of his soldiers is in danger."
The minister announced the protest after the head of parliament's foreign  affairs committee Peter Duetoft called for such a move to protest lack of  protection for the UN force's Nordic contingents.
