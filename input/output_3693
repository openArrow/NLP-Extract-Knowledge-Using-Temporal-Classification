Somerset skipper Andy Hayhurst branded  Brian Lara's latest heroics as a "farce" here on Tuesday.
The Trinidadian left-hander braved awful weather to smash his fifth  century in a row on Monday to clinch a Warwickshire county championship  victory over Somerset.
But Hayhurst said: "Lara played magnificently, but it was a farce. I told  the umpires that conditions were unplayable in my opinion but they could see  nothing wrong.
"The outfield was saturated and the game should never have re-started.  Fielding was almost impossible and in places it was dangerous for the players."
Lara's match-winning 136 followed his world record Test score of 375  against England and consecutive county scores of 147, 106 and 120 not out.
Lara now needs to score a century in his next innings in the championship  match against Middlesex at Lord's, starting on Thursday, to join an elite band  of batsmen -- C B Fry (1901), Sir Donald Bradman (1938-39) and Mike Procter  (1970-71) -- who have all scored six successive first class tons.
