President Bill Clinton has asked Britain to  allow the US Coast Guard to use the Turks and Caicos Islands to process  thousands of Haitian refugees, The Washington Post said Wednesday.
Clinton made the request in a telephone conversation Monday with British  Prime Minister John Major, who told him he would give the matter careful  consideration, unnamed administration officials told the daily.
Bowing to pressure from human rights groups, Clinton on May 8 decided to  give fleeing Haitians immigration hearings before turning back those not  considered political refugees, reversing a two-year policy begun by his  predecessor Geoge Bush.
Clinton said he would seek the help of other countries to process the  refugees or hold the hearings on the high seas aboard ships.
A diplomatic source familiar with the telephone conversation told the  daily that Major "understood the importance of (Clinton's) request and would  consult with his governent and the government of the Turks and Caicos."
The officials said that if London consented to the arrangement, the  refugees could be processed not on land but aboard ships docked or anchored in  the islands.
The Turks and Caicos are some 30 islands southeast of the Bahamas, of  which only six are inhabited.
If no country offers its territory as a staging ground for the refugees,  contingency plans are being developed to do the processing aboard chartered  cruise liners, the officials said.
The number of Haitians willing to risk an ocean crossing to reach US  shores increased dramatically after democratically-elected president  Jean-Bertrand Aristide was forced into exile by a military coup September 1991.
