Almost one in two Europeans believes the European  parliament should be given more powers, according to a poll to be published  Wednesday.
But the survey by the Louis Harris polling institute, to be published in  seven European newspapers, indicates wide divergences from one country to the  other.
Overall, 46 percent of those polled said the parliament, to be renewed in  continent-wide elections in June, "does not have enough powers."
However support for the view varied widely -- from 20 percent in Portugal  to 60 percent in eastern Germany.
In between were Denmark (25 percent), Britain (36), Luxembourg (44),  Netherlands (47), Belgium (48), Ireland and Spain (50 percent), Greece and  France (54), Italy and western Germany (55).
Twenty percent of those polled said the parliament had too much power, 15  percent said it had enough and 19 percent did not know.
In other questions, 79 percent of those polled said they were in favour of  enlarging the European Union. The poll was conducted between May 11-26,  questioning about 500 people in each EU country.
