sharply higher then lower. The price of white sugar climbed at the  beginning of the week, influenced by a speculative wave which flooded the  coffee and cocoa markets, pushing prices up. Sugar prices reached their  highest levels since March.
The rise was magnified as news that the Cuban harvest had suffered from  massive rains. Once the speculative wave was over, prices were lower.
The firmness of prices was attributable to a persistant shortage in white  sugar in European ports. Dealers said the situation was unlikely to improve  before the autumn.
On Friday, India announced it was importing 850,000 tonnes of sugar to  avoid a shortage, which should also push the price up.
Elsewhere, the International Sugar Organisation (ISO) revised downwards  its world production deficit by 100,000 tonnes to 2.3 million tonnes for the  season 1993-1994 (October-September).
VEGETABLE OILS: lower. The price of nearly all the vegetable oils fell on  the Rotterdam market in a week shortened by the Pentecost holiday on Monday.
The price of soya fell, as the sharp rises on the Chicago market had  little influence on the Rotterdam market. Brazilian production is predicted to  reach a new record at 25.08 million tonnes in 1993-1994 (October-September),  according to official figures.
Palm oil fell, despite figures from Malaysia showing production had fallen  seven percent to 1.72 million tonnes during the first quarter, compared to the  same period a year earlier.
