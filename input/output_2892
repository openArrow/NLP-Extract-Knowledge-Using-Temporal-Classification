Iranian ground forces began a series of military  exercises across the country on Sunday to mark the 12th anniversary of the  liberation of a southern port city, the official news agency IRNA said.
The five-day manoeuvres, code-named Thunder-7, aim to "increase the army's  combat capability" and mark the May 1982 liberation of Khoramshahr, in  Khuzestan province, from Iraqi occupation during the 1980-1988 war.
Thousands of troops, using heavy weapons and sophisticated military  equipment, took part in manoeuvres in the Darengon region of Shiraz, in  southern Fars province, IRNA said.
Similar exercises are to be staged in the provinces of Khuzestan, Khorasan  and Terhan, it added.
