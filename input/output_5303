Two candidates of the Malawi Congress Party  (MCP), whose election to parliament was nullified because of alleged  irregularities, have petitioned the High Court to overturn the ruling, local  media reported Monday.
MCP vice-president Gwanda Chakuamba and Grace Chikweza, who won  parliamentary seats in Nsanje in the May 17 elections, say the poll was  declared free and fair by local and international observers.
Their victories were nullified by the Electoral Commission, headed by High  Court judge Anastazia Msosa, after it investigated complaints of  irregularities and by-elections were ordered to be held June 28.
The commission said it had discovered that at one polling station figures  kept by monitors did not tally with official figures and documents such as  ballot paper counterfoils had gone missing.
The MCP, the party of former president Kamuzu Banda, was beaten in the  elections by the United Democratic Front of newly-installed President Bakili  Muluzi.
