More than 15 percent of the joint ventures launched  since Vietnam opened its economy to outside investment in 1987 have failed or  are on the brink of bankruptcy, according to official statistics published  here Tuesday.
The army daily Quan Doi Nhan Dan complained that the failure rate is twice  that of other countries in the region.
In more recent years, the Vietnamese government has had to withdraw 16  percent of the permits it granted to joint ventures, even before some of them  began operations, because the projects were insolvent, according to figures  from the State Committee for Cooperation and Investment (SCCI).
The government has approved nearly 850 projects for foreign investment,  worth a total of 8.5 billion dollars, since the end of 1987.
By May, only 773 approved joint ventures were still operating, worth eight  billion in investment, the SCCI said.
The failure was basically due to foreign partners who failed to honor  their side of the bargain and provided too little money too late, the  Vietnamese authorities said.
The press is calling for the government to tighten regulation of foreign  companies investing in new projects.
Sectors that have attracted the most foreign investment since 1987 are  industry (3.5 billion dollars), tourism (1.5 billion dollars), oil (1.2  billion dollars), transportation and telecommunications (600 million dollars)  and trade and services (360 million dollars), Quan Doi Nhan Dan said.
