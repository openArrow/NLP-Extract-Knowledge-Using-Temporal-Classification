In a decision that could mark a turning  point in sexual abuse trials, a jury ruled therapists altered the memory of  their patient and falsely cultivated visions of her father raping her.
The Friday ruling challenges the strength in court of so-called recovered  memories and supports the right of third parties to sue therapists.
Recovered memories are the emergence in adulthood of childhood  recollections through psychological treatment. Supporters and opponents of the  theory kept a close eye on the case.
Winery executive Gary Ramona had sought eight million dollars from family  counselor Marche Isabella, psychiatrist Richard Rose and the Western Medical  Center in Anaheim, charging malpractice in treating his daughter, Holly, 23.
She reported flashbacks of childhood sexual abuse while being treated for  eating disorders and depression four years ago.
Gary Ramona accused Rose and Isabella of using "drugs and quackery" to  convince Holly that he raped and sexually molested her from age five until age  16.
Attorneys for Gary Ramona argued the flashbacks could have come from a  urinary tract examination Holly had at age six.
The jury awarded Gary Ramona 500,000 dollars. He had lost his  400,000-dollar-a-year job, and his wife divorced him, even though he was never  charged.
Experts split on the verdict's impact.
"It's going to intrude upon and jeopardize the ability of therapists to  provide good quality, competent therapy," said Mary Riemersma, executive  director of the California Association of Marriage and Family Therapists.
"People have to realize that engaging in activities that lead people to  create wild memories is hurting all of society," said Elizabeth Loftus, a  University of Washington psychologist who testified for Ramona.
