The Yemeni government on Monday sent envoys to New  York to take part in a UN Security Council debate on the country's civil war,  the official news agency SABA said.
Abdel Aziz Abdel Ghani, a member of the presidential council, said that he  and Justice Minister Abdallah Ahmad Ghanem would "expose the truth of what is  happening in Yemen."
The Yemeni people expect the Security Council, which is to meet on  Tuesday, to help "safeguard the country's unity and democracy," he said,  accusing the south of mounting an armed rebellion to tear Yemen apart.
Sanaa has said it opposes the UN debate because the north-south civil war  was a strictly internal matter, whereas the south has welcomed UN efforts to  bring about a ceasefire in the war which has raged since May 5.
Northern forces loyal to President Ali Abdallah Saleh's northern-based  government are fighting to crush a delaration of independence by the south,  led by his former vice president Ali Salem al-Baid.
