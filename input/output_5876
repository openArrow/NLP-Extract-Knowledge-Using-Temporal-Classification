Ukrainian officials and western nuclear experts  deadlocked Tuesday over the future of the Chernobyl nuclear power station,  Deputy Ukrainian Prime Minister Valery Chmarov said.
The experts from the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations met  their Ukrainian counterparts in Kiev but "were not agreed on the amount of  financial aid to provide Ukraine for the construction of a station destined to  replace the Chernobyl reactor," Chmarov said.
"The sum needed to cover all the works can be calculated in billions of  dollars," Chmarov told the ITAR-TASS news agency.
"For the shut-down (of Chernobyl) alone, you have to count at least four  billion dollars," he said.
"If you want to avert the danger, help us," he added.
Chmarov said further talks would take place with the G7 countries --  Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- but  did not give a timetable for the meetings.
The western experts are to prepare a report before the next G7 summit  meeting in Naples, Italy July 8-10, where the closure of Chernobyl and  providing Ukraine with financial aid are due to be discussed.
Last Friday, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravtchouk raised his estimate of  the cost of shutting Chernobyl down and building a replacement at 14 billion  dollars. The European Commission has estimated the closure costs at 1.5  million dollars.
Chenobyl was the site of the world's worst nuclear accident when on April  23, 1986 when its number four reactor exploded, releasing a huge radioactive  cloud that drifted over much of eastern and western Europe.
