Former East German leader Erich Honecker's health  has taken a turn for the worse, his Friends Committee here reported Monday.
Honecker, 81, is suffering from kidney cancer and has been living in Chile  since January 14, 1993, after a German court dropped charges against him in  the killings of East Germans who tried to escape over the Berlin Wall while  Honecker headed a communist government there.
"According to our information, the cancerous tumor has worsened," said  Carlos Arriagada, spokesman for the committee of Honecker's supporters.
His current condition "is quite delicate," Arriagada added.
Honecker's daughter has resided in Chile for several years.
