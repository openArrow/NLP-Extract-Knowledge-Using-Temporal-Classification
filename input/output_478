The media here blasted the British government  Saturday for refusing to comment on the alleged bugging of the Iranian embassy  in London, saying its silence acted as proof of the "act of espionage."
Tehran said Wednesday that a listening device had been found inside a wall  at the Iranian embassy in London about two weeks ago. Britain has refused to  comment on the affair.
The affair dominated media headlines Saturday with papers of every  political persuasion as well as the official agency IRNA criticising London.
Kayhan, a daily close to Islamic hardliners, called the discovery of the  device "a scandal" and criticised the British government for its "ambiguous  silence."
A conservative daily, Resalat, meanwhile urged the government to punish  Britain by reconsidering its political and economic ties.
"The Iranian nation cannot see Tehran have warm economic relations with a  country which conspires against it," it warned.
Iranian deputy foreign minister for European Affairs, Mahmud Vaezi has  said workers found the battery-charged device while tearing down a wall in  Iran's new embassy building.
But Iran decided not reveal the discovery pending further investigation,  he added.
He said Tehran had sought explanation from London, but stressed that the  discovery would "weaken relations with Britain.
Iranian president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani has charged the device's  discovery led Britain to "fabricate the baseless story" over alleged Iranian  links with the Irish Republican Army (IRA), to avoid embarrassment over the  issue.
In late April London accused Tehran of having contacts with the IRA and  summoned Iranian charge d'affairs Gholamreza Ansari to the Foreign Office to  demand that any contact with the provisionals should cease.
Tehran has called on Britain to provide proof of its allegations.
