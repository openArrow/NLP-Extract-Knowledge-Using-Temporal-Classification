The United Nations food agency warned on Wednesday  that a major humanitarian disaster was looming in southern Sudan as the  international community diverted relief aid to blood-soaked Rwanda.
The World Food Programme (WFP) said some two million people out of a  population of about 4.5 million in war- and famine-battered southern Sudan  depend on food aid.
But international relief efforts have been focused on Rwanda, where half a  million people have been slaughtered in six weeks.
"WFP fears that the emergency in Rwanda could overshadow the immense  humanitarian crisis peaking in southern Sudan," the agency said in a statement  released here.
WFP appealed for 60 million dollars earlier this year to transport nearly  200,000 tonnes of food to southern Sudan.
But so far the agency has received only 6.7 million dollars, or 11 percent  of the amount it needs, and less than half of the 69,000 tonnes of additional  food required.
Four to six children are starving to death daily around the southern town  of Wau, and displaced people are streaming into Wau in their thousands, most  severely malnourished.
"This is unacceptable given that almost 20,000 toones of food are  currently available in stores in Lokichoggio (northern Kenya) and Kampala  (Uganda's capital)," WFP said.
