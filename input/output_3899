The Los Angeles area was hit by another  aftershock early Tuesday but there were no immediate reports of any injuries  or damage.
The moderate temblor was measured at 4.5 on the open-ended Richter scale  with an epicenter some 23 miles (33 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles, said  Heather Lobasz of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
The quake was an aftershock to the Northridge earthquake in January which  killed 61 people, injured more than 9,000 and caused 20 billion dollars in  damage.
There have been more than 8,000 aftershocks since the January earthquake.
