The five permanent Security Council members  met but took no action Monday on North Korea amid mounting concerns about  Pyongyang's refusal to allow monitoring of the refueling of a nuclear reactor.
Diplomats said Monday's meeting, which followed a similar session  Saturday, was suspended after China balked at a resolution that included a  call for sanctions against North Korea.
The other four permanent members -- France, Britain, Russia and the United  States -- were believed to be in agreement on the wording of a resolution  calling for international experts to be present to ensure that plutonium is  not diverted from the Yongbyon nuclear reactor.
The International Atomic Energy Agency has said that without full  inspections it cannot guarantee that fuel is not being diverted to weapons  purposes.
Earlier Monday, South Korean President Kim Young-Sam said the standoff had  entered a "crucial" stage because of North Korea's refusal to allow monitoring  of the discharge of spent reactor fuel rods.
Washington suspects North Korea has diverted plutonium in past years, and  says outside checks are essential to determine if the isolated communist  regime has embarked on a nuclear weapons program. North Korea denies it has  produced any nuclear weapons.
France called for UN sanctions to be applied against North Korea if  Pyongyang should prove to have reneged on its commitments to give  international inspectors full access to the nuclear reactor.
