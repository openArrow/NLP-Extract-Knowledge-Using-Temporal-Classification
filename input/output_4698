Two British women Friday won an 11th hour reprieve  from an order extraditing them to the United States to face charges they  plotted to murder an assistant federal attorney in 1985.
Home Secretary Michael Howard earlier Friday had ordered Susan Hagan, 47,  and Sally Croft, 44, taken directly to London's Heathrow Airport and put on a  flight to the United States.
But their lawyer, Andrew McCooey, shortly afterward said the Home Office  had agreed to postpone extradition until next week.
"They have conceded that we should be able to make a fresh challenge by  way of judicial review to the Home Secretary's latest irrational decision," he  said.
The women are accused of conspiring to kill Charles Turner, a US attorney  for Oregon, when they were members of the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh religious  cult in that state in the US Pacific Northwest.
The alleged plot was never carried out.
They were indicted in Oregon in 1990 and have been fighting extradition  ever since.
The two deny the allegations, but say they face "trial by media" and  claimthey would not get a fair hearing because of the anti-Bhagwan feelings in  the state.
The women appeared shocked by the immediacy of Friday's order, which was  read in court by a representative of the Home Office who said she had learned  of it only a short time earlier.
"I cannot believe they are doing this so quickly," said Hagan. "I haven't  even got a toothbrush.
"I would have thought that after the support for us and the outrage about  this case in England, some glimmer of commonsense might have prevailed at some  point."
