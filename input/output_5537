The German Bundesbank "cannot be satisfied" with  a rate of inflation slightly in excess of 3 percent as is currently the case,  according to board member Otmar Issing.
Issing made the comment in a speech, issued here, to be pronounced at the  Norwegian Society of Financial Analysis in Oslo.
"With a rate of inflation, as measured by the cost-of-living index, of  still slightly over 3 percent at present in Germany, the Bundesbank cannot be  satisfied, even if the trend has been pointing in the right direction for some  time and even if we had a rate with a four before the decimal point for much  of last year," Issing said.
The fight against inflation remained one of the priorities for the  Bundesbank, he noted.
According to figures published last week by the central office of  statistics, inflation in western Germany was down last month to 2.9 percent in  annual terms, the first time in three years it has dropped below 3 percent.
In eastern Germany, inflation in April stood at an annual rate of 3.3.  percent.
Despite unification, there are still no official joint statistics for  consumer prices in both halves of Germany.
