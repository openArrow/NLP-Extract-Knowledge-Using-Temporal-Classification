England have called up Warren Barton, Wimbledon's  uncapped right back, for their friendly against Greece on Tuesday, after  Manchester United's Paul Parker was ruled out by an ankle injury.
Barton, 25, has proved to be a solid defender, helping the unfashionable  south London side to finish sixth in the Premiership.
He will be an understudy for Liverpool's Rob Jones for the Wembley  double-header against World Cup finalists Greece and Norway next Sunday.
