Defence ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty  Organisation gather here Tuesday for a twice-yearly security review expected  to be dominated by NATO's military links with Russia.
Towards the end of the meeting, Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev is  scheduled to present Moscow's terms for joining NATO's partnership-for-peace  programme of military cooperation with the countries of the former Soviet bloc.
Grachev said at the weekend that Russia wanted "more serious and deeper  relations with NATO than those envisaged in the partnership", which was  launched in January.
But other eastern European countries are fearful of Russian involvement in  NATO decision-making. NATO diplomats have said the alliance is ready to offer  Moscow an "intensified dialogue" but no special strategic relationship.
Grachev is also scheduled to present Russia's long-awaited new military  doctrine to replace Moscow's old Cold War security blue-print.
NATO diplomats say they are anxious to hear how the doctrine reflects  Russia's plans for dealing with its "near abroad" -- the other countries of  the former Soviet Union.
The NATO ministers were also due to debate peace efforts in  Bosnia-Hercegovina, nuclear non-proliferation and ways to prevent the  weakening of NATO force structures through defence budget cuts in member  countries.
