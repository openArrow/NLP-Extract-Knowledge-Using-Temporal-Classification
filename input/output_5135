Britain's Damon Hill drove his Williams Renault  to victory in the Spanish Grand Prix on Sunday to deny Michael Schumacher a  fifth straight win on the formula one circuit.
Schumacher, who lost the lead during a pit stop 20 laps from the end, came  home in second to stay comfortably at the top of the world championship  standings. The Benetton-Ford driver had won the first four races of the season.
Another Briton, Mark Blundell, was third in a Tyrrell-Yamaha.
Hill's win was the first for Williams since his victory in the Italian  Grand Prix at Monza last September.
After the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at San Marino  last month and the accident at Monte Carlo that left Austrian Karl Wendlinger  in a coma, organisers were relieved to see Sunday's race finish without  serious incident.
