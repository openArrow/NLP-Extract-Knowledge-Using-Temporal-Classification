A subsidiary of US firm Vaalco Energy Inc. flowed  oil in commercial quantities at an offshore drilling site in the western  Philippines, but the local unit of another US company, Anderman-Smith, struck  out at nearby Mindoro island, the energy department said Thursday.
Alcorn (Production) Philippines Inc. flowed the West Linapacan A-4  sidetrack well at the rate of 2,603 barrels per day (bpd) after failing on its  first attempt with the A-5 well, the department said in its drilling bulletin.
West Linapacan is the site of the Philippines' only commercially producing  oil wells, but water seepage has drastically reduced output to only 3,500 bpd  from 15,000 bpd last year.
Alcorn drilled the sidetrack wells in a bid to boost production. The  operator is continuing to conduct drillings to determine the stabilized flow  rate, the energy department said.
Meanwhile, Anderman Smith, Philippines Inc. is abandoning onshore prospect  Cambayan-1 on Mindoro Island south of here "after failing to encounter any  reservoir rock," the oil bulletin said.
The operator, which has Filipino partners, has plugged the first well  drilled, it added.
The energy department has authorized drilling of 20 wells in several  prospects in the Philippines this year. Oil exploration is attracting foreign  interest due to the vast amount of resources and technology needed in these  areas, which are mostly offshore.
