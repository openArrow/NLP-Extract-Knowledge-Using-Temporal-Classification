Breyer, a New Englander, studied law at Harvard University and became a  clerk for then-Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg. In the 1970s, he taught  antitrust and administrative law at Harvard Law School.
Building a reputation as a hardworking intellectual with an ability to  build consensus, Breyer was next named to a federal commission to set  sentencing guidelines.
The panel's decision to toughen some sentences has angered factions in the  judicial community who feel that the guidelines do not give judges enough  leeway.
Breyer was named to the 1st Circuit Court in December 1980 and became  chief judge 10 years later.
The retirement of Blackmun after 24 years on the court gave Clinton his  second nominee and a chance to help reshape the high court after it became  dominated by nominees of Republican presidents.
The court, headed by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, 69, named by Richard  Nixon, has taken a conservative tilt in recent years.
The other justices are Anthony Kennedy, a 57-year-old moderate  conservative named by Ronald Reagan; Sandra Day O'Connor, a 64-year-old  moderate conservative named by Reagan; Antonin Scalia, 58, another Reagan  appointee who is the leading conservative theorist on the court; David Souter,  54, a moderate conservative named by George Bush; John Paul Stevens, 73, a  Gerald Ford appointee who has wavered from liberal to conservative; Clarence  Thomas, 45, a conservative Bush appointee; and Ginsburg, 61, seen as a  moderate centrist.
