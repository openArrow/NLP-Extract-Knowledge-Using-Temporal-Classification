Japan's crude steel production in April dropped 5.7  percent from a year earlier to 7.961 million tonnes for the seventh straight  year-on-year decline, an industry association said Wednesday.
The decline was mostly a reaction to a large output in April last year  when there was a rush in Japan's steel exports to China, the Japan Iron and  Steel Federation said.
April output was up 2.8 percent on the preceding month, the federation  said.
Steel production at blast furnaces dropped 4.6 percent from a year earlier  to 5.444 million tonnes while electric arc output fell 7.8 percent to 2.517  million tonnes.
The output of ordinary steel fell 5.9 percent to 6.518 million tonnes and  that of speciality steel dropped 4.8 percent to 1.443 million tonnes.
