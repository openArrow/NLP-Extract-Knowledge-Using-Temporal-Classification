China's Xinhua news agency announced briefly  Tuesday the two prizes won by Zhang Yimou's film "To Live" at the Cannes film  festival.
But it made no commentary on the awards and radio and television remained  silent.
The movie shared the Grand Jury's award with Russian Nikita Milkhalkov's  "Burnt by the Sun" and its star Ge You won best actor award.
Ministry for film and television officials said they had no comment.
The Chinese authorities were angered because "To Live" was shown without  being approved by the official censor.  Zhang, 43, did not attend the festival  because his film had not received a censors' visa.
Last year Beijing was embarrassed because the Golden Palm award at Cannes  was won by Chen Kaige's "Farewell to my Concubine" which was unflattering to  communist China.
"To Live," co-produced with Taiwan money, tells the story of a Chinese  family from the 1940s through the Cultural Revolution and does not present the  glorious image of communist China the authorities prefer.
Zhang has had several movies censored by the authorities in the past. But  last year he was awarded China's two highest awards for his movie "The Story  of Qiu Jiu."
