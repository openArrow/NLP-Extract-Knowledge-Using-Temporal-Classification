Japan's Toshiba Corp. said Monday it had developed  an overwritable optical-disc drive system which allows 606 megabytes of data  including video pictures to be stored on a 3.5 inch (nine centimetre) disc.
The company said the system, described as the world's first high-capacity  optical-disc drive, was a "dramatic improvement" over conventional rewritable  magneto optical-disc systems requiring whole sections of data to be erased.
Toshiba said the system's ability to store and retrieve large volumes of  data at high speeds enabled it to play up to 20 minutes of moving pictures  based on the video-compression format known as MPEG-2.
The new system uses double-sided phase-change optical discs, where the  reading and writing of data is done by converting the recording layer of the  disc from an amorphous state to a crystalline state.
A Toshiba spokesman said the system, currently at the prototype stage,  needed to be standardised to gain wider market acceptance but refused to  predict when it might become commercially available.
