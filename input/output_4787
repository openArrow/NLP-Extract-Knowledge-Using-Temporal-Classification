Cleveland Indians relief pitcher Matt  Turner has been diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease and will start chemotherapy  in two weeks, the baseball team announced Friday.
Turner, 27, had surgery Tuesday to remove lymph nodes which proved  malignant.
Turner was 1-0 with a 2.13 earned run average in nine games this season.  He was optioned to the minor league Charlotte Knights on May 3, but the  Indians recalled him so he could be put on the 60-day disabled list.
During spring training, Indians relief pitcher Jerry DiPoto was diagnosed  as having thyroid cancer. He has not yet returned to the Indians bullpen.
