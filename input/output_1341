President Bill Clinton said Tuesday that  short-term interest rates could be raised without slowing down the US economy.
"There is clearly some room for short-term interest (rates) over the rate  of inflation that won't slow down our economic growth," Clinton told reporters  at the White House.
The president's comment came as most analysts were expecting the Federal  Reserve's policy-setting committee to boost short-term interest rates at its  closed-door meeting Tuesday.
Financial markets expected the Fed move to raise the federal funds rate --  the overnight interbank loan rate -- by as much as half a percentage point.  The Fed has raised the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point three  times since February 4, pushing it to 3.75 percent.
Clinton's remark, which showed he also expects a rate hike, was clearly  aimed at reassuring financial markets roiled by the Fed moves, which they fear  will throttle economic growth.
"First of all, if this happens, it's because we have growth," Clinton  said, referring to another rate increase.
"Let's get the fundamental facts here," he said. "We have more jobs, lower  inflation and a lower deficit, and expectations for high growth this year,  good growth."
"I make a policy generally not to comment on what the Fed does," he added,  prefacing his surprisingly exceptional remark that there was "room" for  another rate hike.
An hour earlier, White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers, recalling the  administration's traditional hands-off policy toward the independent agency,  said there were few signs of inflationary pressure, a veiled hint that a new  rate hike would not be justified.
Clinton also said that he spoke Monday with Budget Director Leon Panetta,  who assured him that the administration's deficit reduction plan was on target.
"We're well within our projections on deficit reduction," the president  said.
