Seven German soldiers from a battalion forming a  guard of honour to visiting heads of state yelled Nazi and racist slogans  while drunk, police said Tuesday.
The seven were off duty and in civilian dress when they began causing a  disturbance, shouting "gas the Jews" and "foreigners out" Thursday on a bus in  Siegburg, near Bonn. They also attacked a passenger.
The bus driver locked the vehicle's doors and called the police.
Bonn's public prosecutor confirmed an enquiry was under way into several  members of the armed forces for inciting racial hatred and assault.
At least three people were killed during 1992 by soldiers implicated in  extreme rightwing violence. Troops and non-commissioned officers have also  been involved in attacks on homes for asylum-seekers.
Despite what officials called "regrettable incidents," authorities do not  believe there is a hard core of ultra-right extremists in Germany's  370,000-strong armed forces.
