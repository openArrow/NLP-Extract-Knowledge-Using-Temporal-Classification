Some 4,000 people staged a silent march Saturday  through Solingen a year after five Turkish women and girls were killed in a  racist arson attack, as the press carried new allegations of police links to  the incident.
The marchers, both Germans and Turks, carried banners through the western  German town stating, "Don't forget, don't forgive," or "Solingen, humanity's  shame."
The quiet demonstration was in in sharp contrast to the violent street  protests by enraged members of the Turkish community that erupted for several  nights following the May 29, 1993, arson attack on the home of the Turkish  victims.
Four suspects, aged 16 to 24, said to be close to the extreme right, are  facing trial in Duesseldorf for the attack which triggered an international  outcry, amid a spate of xenopobic attacks in Germany.
Der Spiegel magazine, in its latest edition to appear Monday, meanwhile,  said the manager of a martial arts club where three of the four suspected  attackers worked out, was a registered informer on extreme-right circles for  Germany's domestic secret service.
The report, which cited internal secret service documents, said the owner,  Bernd Schmitt, had founded his club with the blessing of authorities in the  hopes that it would attract neo-Nazis and allow officials to keep track of  their movements.
The interior minister for North Rhine-Westphalia, Herbert Schnoor, who is  head of the secret service for the Solingen area, denied the report.
He said his office has no involvement "in founding and promoting  associations to observe people."
Police mobilized 4,000 police and anti-riot squads for weekend duty in  Solingen.
On Sunday, an official ceremony is to be held outside Solingen city hall  with the North Rhine-Westphalia state leader Johannes Rau scheduled to attend.
Ignatz Bubis, head of Germany's key Jewish group, the Central Jewish  Council of Germany, is to speak at the ceremony.
