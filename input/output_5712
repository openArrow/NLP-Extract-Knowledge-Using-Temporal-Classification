Liberia's collegiate presidency has called on  African peacekeeping troops to begin disarming the country's factions in line  with a peace pact signed by the main rivals in a three-year civil war.
In a statement broadcast late Monday, the head of the transitional State  Council, David Kpormakpor, also called on the heads of factions still fighting  to "immediately cease hostilities on all fronts."
The Nigerian-led ECOMOG peacekeepers should "start effective deployment  throught the country and disarm all fighters according to the mandate given to  them under the Cotonou accord," signed in the Beninese capital last July, the  statement said.
"Liberians are now tired with the war, tired of being killed and held  hostage, and they wanted to put their lives back together," Kpormakpor added.  "The widespread indiscriminate killings can not be justified and sustained  under any ground or reason."
The nationwide deployment of ECOMOG troops, who were first sent to Liberia  in 1990 by the Economic Community of West African States, and the disarmament  of factions should have begun on March 7, alongside the creation of  transitional institutions with members from all the parties to the war.
But the disarmament process has been rendered impossible by continuing  conflict.
In western Liberia, rival tribes in the United Liberation Movement (ULIMO)  are battling for control of the faction's headquarters town, Tubmanburg, and  over the number of seats each has been accorded in the transitional  administration.
In the southeast, the main faction, the National Patriotic Front (NPFL) is  under attack from the Liberia Peace Council (LPC), an armed movement that  emerged to fight it in September 1992, after the peace accord was signed.
