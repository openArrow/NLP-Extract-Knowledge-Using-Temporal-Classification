The signing of the humanitarian document had been expected to pave the way  for the opening of political negotiations later on Monday aimed at ending the  bloody conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced  millions of others since the SPLA took up arms in 1983 to end domination of  mainly Christian and animist south by the Arabised Moslem north.
Khartoum has taken advantage of a 1991 split in the rebel movement along  tribal lines to recapture a string of garrison towns it had lost to the SPLA  in the vast swamplands and savannah of the undeveloped south.
But a major government offensive launched at the end of last year seems to  have become bogged down in a virtual stalemate, though it has sent hundreds of  thousands of people fleeing towards Sudan's southern borders.
Previous peace initiatives by IGADD, which groups Kenya, Uganda, Sudan,  Eritrea, Ethiopia and Djibouti, have failed to end the war, though they have  produced agreements to allow in humanitarian aid.
