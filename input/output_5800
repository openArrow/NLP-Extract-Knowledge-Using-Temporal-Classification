French President Francois Mitterrand  closed a two-day Franco-German summit here Tuesday saying that a two-speed  Europe was inevitable until all candidates joined under the same conditions.
Mitterrand, speaking during a press conference with German Chancellor  Helmut Kohl, was responding to questions concerning a proposal made by French  right-wing European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure.
Mitterrand, a socialist, said that "Europe will advance at different  speeds until the day when all (European states) will be in the Union on the  same conditions."
Lamassoure, in an article in Le Monde Monday, said the EU should have "a  new founding contract" that would allow a hard core among the 12 member  countries to pursue a single currency and common defense and immigration  policies.
France fears that the expansion of the EU would render the Union little  more than a free-trade zone.
"It would be disastrous to get to the point of a Europe that is so  enlarged that it ceases to exist," Mitterrand said.
"There is no limit on the expansion of the European Union," he added.  "It's a continent. But before getting there there is much work to be done.
"We would be greatly at fault to turn the enlargement (of the EU) into a  competition between the partners, with each having his favorites," Mitterrand  said. "It is a problem we must commonly address... France and Germany must not  become involved in a competition that would be harmful to our interests."
Kohl added that it would be unacceptable for Europe to become little more  than a free-trade area as promoted by "one person" -- an apparent reference to  Britain's Margaret Thatcher.
"That is not our perception of Europe," he said.
Mitterrand, amused by Kohl's reference to Thatcher, added: "Without  lacking any due respect to that person, one can say that she nonetheless  created some followers."
