The Conservatives could be left with a derisory six  seats in the European parliament following the June 9 elections, according to  the latest Guardian/ICM poll published Thursday.
The opposition Labour party on 47 percent stands 21 points ahead of the  ruling Conservatives on 26 percent, while the Liberal Democrats, currently  Britain's third party, stand on 23 percent.
If these figures are projected on a national basis, Labour would win 65  seats against their current 36, the Conservatives 12 against 32, and the  Liberal Democrats six against none.
However, if they are projected on a region-by-region basis, Labour would  still win 65 seats, but this time the Liberal Democrats would take 12 and the  Conservatives six.
The ICM polling institute interviewed 1,420 adults face to face in 103  randomly-selected constituencies on Friday and Saturday.
