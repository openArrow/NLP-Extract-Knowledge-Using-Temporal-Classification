Wang Dan, a leading Chinese dissident, was  arrested Tuesday by police at his residence in the capital while being  interviewed by journalists, members of his family said.
Wang, 24, a prominent student leader during 1989 pro-democracy  demonstrations, was taken from the residence by about 10 police officers, they  said, adding that no reason was given for his arrest.
"The police told the journalists to leave the appartment since they did  not have official authorization to interview Wang Dan," a family member told  AFP by telephone.
The dissident was being interviewed by the United State's NBC television  network, he said.
Wang was arrested twice in March and was forced to leave Beijing just  before a visit by US Secretary of State Warren Christopher. He returned to the  capital after spending a few days in the countryside.
He spent four years in prison following the 1989 demonstrations, which  were ended with the bloody suppression of the movement at Tiananmen Square,  and was released in February 1993.
His arrest comes only two weeks before the fifth anniversary of the June 4  Tiananmen Square massacre and a decision by US President Bill Clinton on  whether to renew China's most favoured nation (MFN) trade status.
Washington has said China must make progress in human rights if it is to  benefit from renewed MFN which allows about 30 billion US dollars-worth of  Chinese goods to enter the American market at reduced customs tariffs.
