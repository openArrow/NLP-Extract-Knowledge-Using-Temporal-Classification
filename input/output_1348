Diaries kept by a top aide of the late Richard  Nixon show the former president suspicious of Jews, tired of blacks and  ruthless in dealing with the talkative wife of his attorney general.
The daily diaries kept by H.R. Haldeman, which were published Monday, tell  how Nixon believed there was "total Jewish domination of the media" and on  February 26, 1970 "really raged" about US Jews in front of his national  security advisor Henry Kissinger, who is Jewish. He then issued an order "not  to let any Jews see him about the Middle East."
The diaries also say that Nixon was "pretty fed up with blacks."
An entry dated June 26, 1972 -- nine days after the break-in at the  Watergate hotel that brought down Nixon's presidency -- discuss Martha  Mitchell, the wife of then-Attorney General John Mitchell who had a habit of  calling reporters late at night.
The president believed that "John's got to close her down somehow or lock  her up but he can't just leave her speaking out like this. It's going to  create a major national problem," Haldeman said.
The next day he told of how she had resisted when an FBI agent forcibly  removed her telephone.
"She had a monumental tantrum, started throwing things at him, demolishing  the room. They locked her in. She busted the window with her hand, cut herself  badly. They had to get a doctor, who had to throw her on the bed and give her  a shot in order to subdue her," wrote Haldeman, who died last year.
A former aide to Nixon, who died last month, said the excerpts reflect  political frustration, not racism or anti-Semitism.
"I had the privilege of serving him for 15 years and never heard him make  an anti-Semitic statement," said John Taylor, now director of the Nixon  Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda, California.
