A 34th neo-Nazi activist has been arrested in  connection with bomb attacks that left 19 people dead shortly before South  Africa's first all-race elections last month, police said Friday.
The latest suspect, a member of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB)  like the others, was arrested late Thursday in the Lichtenberg region of  Western Transvaal province, police spokesman Colonel Dave Bruce said.
Another member of the AWB was arrested in Orange Free State on Wednesday  in connection with the same wave on bomb attacks in Johannesburg, but freed on  bail like the 32 others detained on April 27.
The arrests in April, during the elections that gave Nelson Mandela's  African National Congress (ANC) most seats in a newly formed government of  national unity, put an end to the attacks that begun on April 24 when a car  bomb explosion killed nine people in central Johannesburg.
