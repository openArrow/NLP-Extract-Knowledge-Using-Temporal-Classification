lower. Oil prices did not benefit from rises in the other  commodities. The price of Brent crude North Sea oil fell during the week, from  16.50 dollars per barrel at the beginning of the week to almost 16 dollars  before lifting slightly on Friday.
The market generally believes that the supply of North Sea oil is  relatively plentiful. British production rose a further one percent during the  month to around 2.45 million barrels per day, the Royal Bank of Scotland said.
Norwegian production, however, fell two percent in April to around 2.49  million barrels per day, figures at the GNI trade house showed.
Elsewhere, GNI belives that the death of several pilgrims on the way to  Mecca could poisen already difficult relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia,  threatening the stability of the region.
But "this sould not affect the politics of OPEC in the short term," GNI  said.
RUBBER: lower. Rubber prices declined as an increase in rubber supplies  appeared on the Indonesian and Malaysian markets, said Andrew Trevatt, a  trader with Lewis and Peat.
The wintering period, during which the latex from the trees runs slower,  is now over and the production has picked up in south-east Asia, he said.
In addition, European demand is slightly depressed as it is every year at  this time. The rubber now bought in Asia will arrive in Europe in July, when  most of the factories are shut for the annual holidays.
