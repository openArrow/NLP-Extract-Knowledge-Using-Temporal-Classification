Iraqi Vice Prime Minister Terek Aziz  lobbied UN members in New York Thursday to lift the oil embargo against his  country.
Next week the Security Council is to review the sanctions imposed against  Baghdad following the invasion of Kuwait, and western diplomats are predicting  that the four-year-old embargo will remain in force.
Aziz said the council should acknowledge that Iraq has complied with UN  resolutions and that conditions for lifting the sanctions have been met.
Some members of the council refuse to recognize the progress Baghdad has  made toward meeting the UN demands, Aziz said following a meeting with  Nigeria's Ibrahim Gambari, who holds the council's rotating presidency.
Iraq is particularly keen on getting rid of the oil embargo in return for  its agreement to meet UN disarmament requirements and has argued that the  allied nations had not kept up their end of the bargain.
Aziz said the United States and Britain should "decide if they are in  compliance with the resolutions they themselves voted or are using those  resolutions to reach special, unilateral, political objectives."
The vice-prime minister is to meet with several Security Council members  before Tuesday's session to review the embargo as well as with the head of the  UN commission to oversee Iraq's disarmament, Rolf Ekeus.
The commission is currently working on a system for monitoring Iraq's  weapons capabilities long-term which diplomats said could be operational by  July.
A six-month probationary period would be required before the commission  could verify Baghdad's compliance with all the conditions to the Security  Council, which would then consider lifting the sanctions, sources said.
