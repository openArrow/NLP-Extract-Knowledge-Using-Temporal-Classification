At least 13 people were killed and hundreds  injured as ethnic riots flared in the north-eastern frontier state of Assam  between native Assamese and Bodo tribespeople, news reports said Saturday.
Bodo arsonists torched 10 villages as the rioting broke out Friday in the  countryside centred on the district of Kokrajhar, the Press Trust of India  (PTI) said, adding that the death toll was expected to increase.
"Some of the villages were burning throughout the night," it quoted  officials in Guwahati, Assam's principal city, as saying.
Most victims were reported to be non-tribal natives of Assam, an oil- and  mineral-rich state of 22 million bordering Bangladesh hit by periodic  outbreaks of ethnic trouble.
The latest rioting followed Bodo demands that non-tribal settlers leave  Bodo-dominated villages in Kokrajhar, where 50 people were killed in ethnic  violence last October, PTI said.
A militant section of the Bodos have been campaigning for their own tribal  homeland to be carved out of Assam, which is also the site of an insurgency  led by Assamese militants fighting for secession from India.
