Denny's restaurant chain has agreed to pay 46  million dollars to thousands of discriminated black patrons around the  country, in the biggest out-of-court settlement of its kind.
The 1,500-strong chain announced Tuesday it would settle 4,300 complaints  of racial bias, pay more than 8.7 million dollars in lawyers' fees for the  plaintiffs, retrain its employees and conduct random checks of its premises.
The Justice Department determined that some black clients at Denny's were  refused service while others were asked to pay a cover charge, pay in advance  or meet other conditions not requiered of white patrons.
The lawsuits stemmed from complaints filed by six black Secret Service  agents assigned to President Bill Clinton, who on April 1 of last year were  not served for 55 minutes at a Denny's in Annapolis, Maryland, while 15 white  colleagues of theirs in the same time had second and third helpings.
Another client in California complained that his daughter in 1991 was  refused a free dinner on her 13th birthday as the chain had advertised,  despite having presented two documents certifying her age.
The Annapolis case spawned 1,300 bias complaints in 49 states. Denny's has  agreed to pay the six agents 35,000 dollars each and divide 17.3 million among  other victims.
The California incident led to 3,000 other complaints, which Denny's has  settled agreeing to make 25,000-dollar payments to 40 plaintiffs, with another  27 million dollars to be divided among other victims.
Another 450,000 dollars will be paid to the 132-member Martin Luther King  Jr. Choir who were denied service at two Virginia restaurants last year.
"We have no policy and no practice to discriminate against anyone...If  there were situations where there was (discrimination), we apologize for  that,"
Jerome Richardson, chairman of Flagstar Companies Inc., Denny's parent  company, said at a press conference Tuesday.
