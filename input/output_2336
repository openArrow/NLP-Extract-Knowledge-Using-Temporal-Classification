Five patients may have become infected with the  hepatitis-C virus by general anaesthetic during surgery at a hospital here,  health authorities said Friday.
A preliminary health department report said it was believed to be the  first instance of patient-to-patient transmission of hepatitis-C via  anaesthetic in the western world.
The report found the virus was possibly transmitted through tubes used to  supply anaesthetic gas to patients and not through surgical instruments.
The investigation was ordered after the outbreak was detected in five  patients of the MacArthur Private Hospital in suburban Campbelltown earlier  this month.
Hepatitis-C is a serious viral infection of the liver.
New South Wales's state health minister, Ron Phillips, said later he was  confident the health department was addressing infection control issues  following confirmation of the infection.
