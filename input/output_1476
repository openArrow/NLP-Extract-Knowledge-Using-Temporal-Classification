The last of Israel's soldiers left  their positions in Gaza City early Wednesday, completing the pull-out from the  autonomous Palestinian territories of the Gaza Strip and Jericho, an AFP  correspondent said.
The soldiers left firing teargas at taunting Palestinian youths outside  the police station, military headquarters and the Hof military camp, where the  feared Israeli border guards were stationed.
