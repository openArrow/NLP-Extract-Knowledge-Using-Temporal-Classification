Nine Japanese warships left Tuesday to participate  in the RIMPAC military drills to be held in the south Pacific Ocean amid  increasing tension on the Korean peninsula, officials said.
The vessels of the Maritime Self-Defense Force left Yokosuka port,  southwest of Tokyo, and headed for waters around Hawaii to join warships from  the United States, Canada, Australia and South Korea, the defense officials  said.
The eighth biennial RIMPAC exercise from May 24 to July 7, with the  participation of some 200 warships, 200 aircraft and 25,000 soldiers from the  five countries, is expected to pressure North Korea, suspected of developing  nuclear weapons.
North Korea has repeatedly criticized the RIMPAC (Rim of the Pacific  Exercise).
The United Nations Security Council issued a statement Monday, urging  North Korea to suspend its unilateral removal of fuel rods at an experimental  nuclear plant in Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang, and hold talks with the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
