Young leftwing demonstrators jeered "Nazis out!" and  threw eggs and tomatoes at the two main speakers at a Bonn city centre  European election rally Tuesday by the anti-Maastricht Federation of Free  Citizens.
Riot police stood on the platform to protect federation leader Manfred  Brunner and the Austrian rightwing nationalist Joerg Haider from the missiles  with their shields or lent shields to party stewards.
The 1,000 or so demonstrators, including Young Socialist or Greens Party  activists, were kept well back from the plaftorm by barriers and a strong  police presence but virtually drowned out the speeches with whistles and  cat-calls.
The main object of the protestors' indignation was Haider, head of the  Austrian Freedom Party, who called on German voters' support for Brunner's  list in the June 12 elections to the European Parliament.
"One Austrian was enough," said a banner borne by the demonstrators in an  allusion to Adolf Hitler, and counter-speakers called for a fight against the  extreme right to prevent it ever gaining power again in Germany.
Brunner, who spoke out against a centralised Europe and in favour of  national parliaments, accused the opposition Social Democrat Party of impeding  free speech in having called the demonstration.
The Austrian nationalist leader said Germany had paid much more into the  European Union than it got in return, and also appeared to hint that  foreigners or immigrants deprived Germans of jobs.
He and Brunner met with a similarly rowdy reception at a meeting they  staged Monday in Hamburg, and Brunner, a former European Commission official,  seemed to still have a lot of red paint on his coat from that earlier occasion.
At the end of the short meeting, the two speakers were hustled away in a  police van amid pushing and shoving between police and demonstrators, and  there was one arrest. Only a small handful of supporters were in evidence.
