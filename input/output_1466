The Security Council decided Tuesday to  keep in place the strict trade and diplomatic embargo slapped on Iraq in 1990,  diplomats said.
Ibrahim Gambari, the Nigerian ambassador presiding over the council this  month, said that in the absence of a consensus, council members decided not to  change the embargo imposed following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
Baghdad has pressed unsuccessfully for at least a partial lifting of the  embargo to allow the resumption of oil exports, the major source of hard  currency for Iraq. The Security Council reviews the sanctions' status every 60  days.
James Rubin, a spokesman for the US mission to the United Nations, said it  was unlikely that sanctions would be lifted this year.
A British diplomat said a decision on modifying the embargo may come  toward the end of 1994.
France, China and Russia have suggested that the sanctions be eased to  recognize Baghdad's progress in complying with UN resolutions, particularly in  the area of disarmament.
