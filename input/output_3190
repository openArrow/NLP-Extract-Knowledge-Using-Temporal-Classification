Andrie Kanchelskis will not be turning out for  Russia after all in next month's World Cup.
The Russian team managent, who only a week ago were confident of including  the Manchester United right winger in their squad, disclosed here Monday that  he had declined selection.
Kanchelskis recently renewed his contract with Manchester for another five  years.
