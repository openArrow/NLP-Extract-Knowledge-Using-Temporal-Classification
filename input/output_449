US President Bill Clinton is to meet visiting Irish  Prime Minister Albert Reynolds in Indianapolis on Saturday afternoon to  discuss Northern Ireland, officials in Dublin announced.
Reynolds, who arrived in the United States on Friday, had not been  scheduled to meet any members of the US administration during his trip, which  is essentially concerned with trade, until he received the last-minute  invitation from Clinton.
Reynolds met businessmen in Chicago on Friday and was to have been the  guest of an American university on Saturday.
He will make the trip to Indianapolis, but it was not known what time he  would meet Clinton or how long the meeting would last.
It will be the leaders' second meeting in less than two months. Clinton  invited Reynolds to Washington on March 17.
The Irish government on Friday transmitted a document to London detailing  demands for clarification of the Anglo-Irish joint declaration from Sinn Fein,  the political wing of the outlawed Irish Republican Army.
Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams on Friday urged the British government to  respond positively to the request, saying: "It is necessary that the replies  from London to our questions properly and honestly clarify these issues so  that the peace process can be advanced."
A statement issued by Northern Ireland Secretary Patrick Mayhew said the  British government would study and make public Sinn Fein's demands for  clarification.
Reynolds is due to fly back to Dublin on Sunday.
