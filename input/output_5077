More than 40 wounded civilians from southern  Yemen have been flown to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for treatment and more  will be brought here, hospital sources said on Sunday.
The wounded, some with serious injuries, have been sent to three  government hospitals in Abu Dhabi and the oasis city of Al-Ain.
"Some of them have been seriously injured while others are suffering from  permanent physical damage," a doctor told AFP. "All of them were brought from  the south four days ago."
Doctors said a state of emergency had been announced at those hospitals to  deal with more wounded. They had no idea how the injured were brought but  official sources said they were flown from the south by special aircraft.
Civil war has been raging between the south and rival for almost four  weeks but there have been no official or independent figures on total  casualties.
The UAE has been actively involved in Arab efforts to end the war,   triggered by political differences between president Ali Abdullah Saleh and    his southern rival Ali Salim al-Baid.
An envoy of Baid, Haidar Abu Baker al-Attas, is visiting the UAE as part  of an Arab tour following the declaration of a breakaway state in the south,  four years after the merger of the two.
