Georgian artillery pounded a valley east of the  separatist region of Abkhazia Wednesday injuring four separatist soldiers,  Abkhazian authorities in Moscow reported.
They said said some 250 mortars were fired Tuesday and Wednesday from the  town of Kapchar, located in a mountainous region east of Abkhazia.
Abkhazian authorities in recent weeks have reported several attacks by  Georgian troops against separatist positions, a charge the government in  Tbilisi has denied.
The two sides on May 14 signed a peace accord that has never gone into  effect.
The accord, brokered by Russia, calls for a ceasefire, the return of some  200,000 refugees, and the deployment of a peacekeeping force from the  Commonwealth of Independent States in a security zone the length of the Inguri  river.
Opposition members of the Georgian parliament say the accord amounts to a  "capitulation," while the separatists say it is a first step that should lead  to further negotiations for the independence of Abkhazia.
Abkhazian separatists declared the northwestern Georgian region  independent in July 1992, sparking an assault by government forces sent by  Tbilisi.
However, after 13 months of fighting which left more than 3,000 people  dead, the separatists routed Georgian troops and chased them from the regional  capital Sukhumi.
An estimated 200,000 Georgian civilians fled the embattled region after  the fall of Sukhumi.
