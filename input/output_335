Cuban wrestler Lazaro Reinoso, an Olympic  bronze medallist in 1992, defected in Miami as he traveled with the Cuban team  to a meet in the United States, a Cuban exile group said Friday.
The 24-year-old Reinoso apparently asked for political asylum while  clearing customs at Miami International airport on Thursday night.
"He said his biggest ambition was to come to the United States to be a  free man and to compete as a member of the US wrestling team," said Mario  Miranda, a spokesman for the Cuban American National Foundation.
Miranda said two other Cuban wrestlers, Jesus Wilson and Josvani Negret,  disappeared after leaving the plane.
"Nobody knows where the other two went," Miranda said. "They just walked  out of the airport."
Two Cuban rowers, Usbiel Himely Medina and Tatiana Valdez Sarria, have  arrived in Miami after coming into America through Texas earlier this week,  Miranda said. He said both plan to ask for asylum.
