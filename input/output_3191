US and Japanese negotiators went into a fifth  day of talks here Monday to try to break a three-month deadlock in bilateral  trade negotiations.
Sakayuki Hayashi, Japanese deputy foreign minister for economic affairs,  would say only that the talks were continuing as he entered the US Trade  Representative's Office here.
The talks, which began Thursday, were originally scheduled to last only  one day but the two sides are now meeting for the sixth time to try to resolve  their differences.
They are trying to agree on ground rules for resuming negotiations on ways  to open Japan's markets and reduce its 60 billion dollar trade surplus with  Washington. The talks collapsed in February in disagreement over how to  measure progress.
