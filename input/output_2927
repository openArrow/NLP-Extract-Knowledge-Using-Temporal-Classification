Michael Stitch followed his victory  over world number one Pete Sampras with a three-set win over Sergi Bruguera  here on Sunday.
Victory gave Germany a 1-0 lead over Spain in the World Team Cup.
Stitch turned in a fine exhibition of serve and volley to dispose of the  reigning French Open champion 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 in just over one and a half hours.
He said Saturday's victory over Sampras had given his confidence a timely  boost.
"But I also like playing Sergi because he can't hit me off the court," he  said.
"I served very well in the second and third sets, coming in more and  taking more risks. It was one of those days when everything worked well.
"That doesn't mean that I am one of the big favourites for the French  Open. It's a different city and different courts."
Bruguera said the loss would not undermine his confidence.
"I've been playing well, even in this match, and I've beaten some good  players this week," he said.
"I think I was playing much better last year at this time, but I'm still  playing well."
And he was not worried by Sampras being made favourite for the French  title.
"What people say about Pete doesn't bother me, so I feel no pressure in  defending my title," Bruguera said.
The German ace got off to a shaky start, due mainly to difficulties with  his return of service.
Even so, Bruguera had to survive two break points in the opening game  before bouncing back to break serve twice, for 3-1 and 6-2.
But Stitch immediately hit back for a decisive break of the Spaniard's  serve in the opening game of the second set that was sufficient to level the  match at 1-1.
The German quickly established control in the third set, breaking for a  3-2 lead when the elegant Bruguera hit a dropshot short.
