A plan by the commission of the European Union to  restructure the steel industry has been killed by problems in reducing  capacity, Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said here on Thursday.
The plan was well and truly dead because it had proved impossible to reach  a minimum figure for the reduction of productive capacity, he told a press  conference.
It would be impossible to achieve cuts of 19 million tonnes per year in  the capacity to produce rolled steels.
The plan had been launched by industry ministers from the 12 EU countries  in February 1993.
