Japan maintained the world's top position in  overseas net assets for the third consecutive year in fiscal 1993, posting 611  billion dollars, up 18.9 percent from the preceding year, the government said  Friday.
Net assets are the balance after liabilities are subtracted from assests  held in foreign countries.
Japan's assets overseas in fiscal 1994 ending in March totaled 2.181  trillion dollars, up 7.2 percent from the preceding year, while liabilities  rose 3.2 percent to 1.570 trillion dollars, the finance ministry said.
It said that a record high current account surplus of 131.4 billion  dollars contributed to the jump in the overseas net assets.
Japan's short and long-term capital accounts suffered deficits with a rise  in its securities investment overseas, the ministry said.
The latest available statistics show that Germany held overseas net assets  worth 257.6 billion dollars at the end of last June, ministry officials said.
Germany is believed to be the world's second largest holder of such  assets, they said.
In sharp contrast to Japan and Germany, the United States had net  liabilities worth 521.3 billion dollars at the end of 1992, the officials said.
