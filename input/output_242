Share prices gained ground on the Tokyo Stock  Exchange this week, supported by active buying by overseas investors following  a continued fall in the Japanese yen.
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues in the first section  increased 408.28 points or 2.1 percent this week to 20,270.75 points after  rising 137.22 points the previous week.
It was the first time since April 15 that the key indicator ended a week  above the psychologically important 20,000 mark.
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) of all issues in the  section rose 27.51 points to 1,643.20 following last week's 12.36 point rise.
First section turnover averaged 287.96 million shares up from 153.6  million shares traded last week. The average daily value of transactions  expanded from last week's 162.95 billion yen (1.6 billion dollars) to 279.15  billion yen.
After opening the week at 19,771.75 points, the Nikkei fell Monday as  investors failed to find fresh factors to stimultate the sluggish market  following last week's three-day national holiday.
But the key index rose for the rest of the week, as foreign investors, who  have been major players in the market during the year so far, actively joined  buying interest, brokers said.
They said most investors here weclomed the recent fall in the yen, which  would help export-oriented Japanese companies avoid unnecessary exchange  losses.
The dollar rose this week amid speculation that the United States was  acting together with Japan and European nations to save the US currency from  falling further.
The dollar, which almost fell below the 100 yen line two weeks ago, ended  here at 104.58 yen, up 1.48 yen from last week.
Brokers said investors were still waiting for earnings reports for the  year to March 31 to be issued in the coming weeks.
"The market is still in a good mood," a Tokyo-based broker said. "If  companies show better-than-expected profits in their annual reports, many  players, particularly corporate investors, will come back to the market  easily."
Car makers ended mixed this week. Toyota Motor remained unchanged at 1,980  yen, but Nissan Motor gained 16 yen to 875 yen. Honda Motor increased 60 yen  to 1,770 yen.
Many electronics makers gained ground on the depreciation of the yen. Sony  ended up 180 yen at 5,880 yen and Matsushita Electric Industrial rose 50 yen  to 1,710 yen. Sharp gained 40 yen to 1,700 yen.
Computer makers also enjoyed profits, with NEC rising 40 yen to 1,180 yen,  Fujitsu increasing 30 yen to 1,050 yen.
