A medical specialist said she destroyed  sensitive records showing brain damage in the case of failed business tycoon  Alan Bond because she had been threatened, the Sunday Times newspaper reported  here.
"My office was broken into at the hospital, and I received threatening  phone calls at my home,"  neuro-radiologist Lesley Cala was quoted as saying  after a court appearance dealing with Bond's questionable purchase of a rare  French painting.
"I thought it prudent for the client (Bond) that I destroy my records, so  if it happened again, there was going to be nothing for them to find," she  said. "I thought it would be wise for me to remove any information that could  be used by the wrong people."
Bond is charged in connection with his acquisition of French impressionist  Edouart Manet's oil painting La Promenade. The prosecution alleges Bond failed  to tell the former Bond Corporation, of which he was chief, in 1988 that it  was in a position to buy the 19th century work below the market value.
The prosecution claims Bond's family company, Dallhold Investments, later  bought the painting for less than two million Australian dollars (1.46 million  US) and sold it at auction a year later for 17 million Australian dollars.
Bond's lawyer's are attempting to delay the hearing on health grounds.  They asked Cala to testify earlier this week, showing records that Bond's  heart surgery last year had caused brain damage affecting his memory, speech  and personality.
Professor Cala told the court she was so disturbed by the break-in and  phone calls and that she reported them to police.
Her evidence about the destruction of documents stunned Bond's senior  lawyer, Tony Howard, and Crown prosecutor Brian Martin.
Her action came to light only when Martin asked her to produce Bond's  medical records.
"They(records) were totally destroyed. I incinerated them," she said.
The application to adjourn the preliminary hearing will now run over into  Monday.
