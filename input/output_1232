Malaysia unveiled Tuesday a blueprint for its  flagging telecommunication industry that would erode the monopoly of national  telecoms firm Telekom Malaysia, officials said.
"To achieve an effective telecoms network, huge investments are necessary  and this burden cannot be shouldered by a single firm," Prime Minister  Mahathir Mohamad said as he launched the National Telecommunication Policy.
Publicly-listed Telekom Malaysia took over almost the entire network of  telecommunications when it was set up under Malaysia's privatisation policy in  1987.
Following Mahathir's announcement, shares in Telekom Malaysia fell 90 sen  to 18.70 ringgit on the local bourse.
Only hours before, the government announced that Binariang, led by local  tycoon Ananda Krishnan, who is closely linked to Mahathir, would effectively  be the biggest competitor to Telekom Malaysia.
Binariang, entrusted with the task of launching Malaysia's maiden  communication satellite programme, would install the country's first fully  digital cellular telephone and state-of-the art fixed telephone networks,  officials said.
The blueprint for the telecoms industry, which is facing projected  development costs running into billions of dollars, was part of Mahathir's  "Vision 2020" to propel Malaysia to industrialised nation status within 26  years.
One of the goals of the government's industrialisation programme was to  have 45 telephones for every 100 people by 2020, up from 12 telephones per 100.
