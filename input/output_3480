A battle between two of the hottest Samoan  prospects for All Black jerseys this year is to end up before a disciplinary  committee.
At the first All Black trial last Sunday former Western Samoan  international scrumhalf Junior Tonu'u left the field with concussion,  apparently following a tackle by Filo Tiatia.
Tonu'u will be out of the game for three weeks and has complained about  being deliberately taken out.
"I'll keep in the back of my mind what happened to me," he said. "I don't  really remember it but I was told what really happened and how it was done. I  know who was involved."
The New Zealand Union's disciplinary commissioner David Howman and  complaints review officer Jock Hobbs have summoned forward Filo Tiatia for an  allegedly dangerous tackle.
Television replays of the incident did not clearly show what happened.
Tonu'u has a lot riding on getting the black jumper. His decision to quit  Manu Samoa and try for the All Blacks prompted an outcry and his family came  in for a lot of flak.
