Some 400 Libyan Moslems have arrived  on camel-back in Tabuk, northwest Saudi Arabia, for the annual pilgrimage to  Mecca, the Organisation of the Islamic Conference said here Sunday.
The caravan of 350 camels was welcomed at the Saudi border by Tabuk  leaders who helped to arrange the trip.
The pilgrims decided to travel to Islam's holiest sites by camel to  protest the UN air embargo on Libya imposed in April 1992 after Tripoli  refused to hand over suspects in bombings of US and French airliners that  killed 440 people.
They left Libya in April and crossed through Egypt and Jordan before  arriving in Saudi Arabia. From Tabuk, they left for Medina and Mecca, again by  camel.
Almost one million pilgrims from across the world have already arrived in  Mecca for the pilgrimage, the highpoint of which will be on Friday when they  climb Mount Arafat, the official Saudi agency SPA said Sunday.
Last year more than two million people took part in the pilgrimage.
