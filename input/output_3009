Vice President Al Gore denied Sunday that  Secretary of State Warren Christopher would soon leave his post and defended  the top US diplomat's record.
Time and US News and World Report, two weekly magazines, reported Walter  Mondale, former vice president under Jimmy Carter and the present US  ambassador to Japan, could possibly replace Christopher.
"I don't think there's any basis for any of those reports, really," Gore  said in an interview with CBS television.
Time cited a highly placed source speaking on condition of anonymity as  saying "the perception of ineptitude (in foreign affairs policy) is growing,"  and it is harming the popularity of President Bill Clinton.
Christopher, according to the weekly, could become special envoy in charge  of the Middle East peace process.
In addition to Mondale, Time listed possible replacements such as the  number-two man at the State Department, Strobe Talbott, National Security  Advisor Anthony Lake, Chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs  Committee Lee Hamilton and the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  Colin Powell.
U.S. News and World Report said Clinton has made no decisions yet, but  reported there might be a larger shuffle afoot. In the U.S. News version,  Christopher would become Chief of Staff for the President, and Mondale or  Thomas Foley, speaker of the House of Representatives, would head up the State  Department.
Talbott would replace Lake in advising the president on foreign affairs.
U.S. News said the reshuffle was meant to provide momentum for the  president as he begins the run up to a re-election bid.
