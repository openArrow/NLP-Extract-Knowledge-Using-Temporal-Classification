English Premiership side Arsenal on Friday shot  down rumours they were about to sign Benfica's Ukrainian-born striker Sergei  Yuran.
A spokeswoman said there was "no truth in the rumour."
Portuguese press reports claimed Yuran, who will play for Russia in next  month's World Cup finals, was set to join Swedish midfielder Stefan Schwarz,  signed from the Portuguese champions by the Gunners last week, at Highbury.
Benfica have not confirmed the transfer.
Yuran is currently in trouble at Benefica, after refusing to sit on the  substitutes' bench during a Portuguese league match two weeks ago.
