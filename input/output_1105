The car crash that landed Hungarian Socialist  Party (HSP) leader Imre Konya in hospital three days before the first round of  legislative elections could have been staged by the HSP, Hungary's Interior  Minister Imre Konya claimed Monday.
In an escalation of the row over the May 5 crash, which left Horn with  concussion, a broken neck vertebra and a broken wrist, Konya told the MTI news  agency that if prearranged, the accident could have been organised by Horn's  opponents inside the HSP, "all the more so as the HSP could gain an advantage  from the accident in the elections".
The HSP came out in front after the first round of elections on May 8.
But Konya added that the police had "no plausible information which would  support a theory of intent".
Horn had told party workers Sunday in his first public appearance since  leaving hospital: "I do not know how to qualify this accident, but the word  accident is, to say the least, an understatement of things which happened to  us in the car."
The HSP dismissed Konya's statement Monday as "absurd speculation" and  "unacceptable" and called on him to stay silent until after a full  investigation.
Police were investigating how Horn's car slammed into an unlit trailer  truck on the roadside.
