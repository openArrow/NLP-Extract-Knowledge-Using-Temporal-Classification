US scientists say they have  discovered a method of tracing the source of bullets while they are still in  the air.
The device, which could mean an end to the relative safety of a hidden  sniper or assassin, consists of a sensor that can be attached to a rifle and a  small computer that can retrace the bullet's path within seconds.
"The aggressor can no longer hide," said Tom Karr, head of the project at  the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California.
The laboratory, better known for designing nuclear weapons, says the  Lifeguard device could help soldiers and police hunt down gunmen and is  seeking a patent.
