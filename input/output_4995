Civil Guards have seized 4,567 kilograms  (10,047 pounds) of hashish in a trailer in this southern Spanish town and  arrested the driver, authorities announced Saturday.
The vehicle, which was on its way from Tanger in Morocco to Madrid, was  loaded with a shipment of 23 tonnes of oranges but civil guards discovered the  drugs hidden among the fruit during a search Friday.
