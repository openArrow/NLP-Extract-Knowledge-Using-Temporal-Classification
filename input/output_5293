China has ordered 191 firms along the Huaihe River  to clean up their act within seven months or be closed down, in a bid to end  catastrophic pollution of the country's fourth biggest waterway, China Daily  said Monday.
A task force backed by the State Council (cabinet), ordered the move at  the start of a campaign to clean up the river within three years, the official  English-language paper said.
Some 1,000 enterprises along the Huaihe discharge about seven million  tonnes of untreated industrial and domestic waste into the river and its  tributaries each day, the report said.
Much of water from the river, which flows through Henan, Anhui and Jaingsu  provinces, cannot be used for cooking or even agriculture production, it said.
Local grain output has fallen and some food by-products have been  seriously contaminated by farmers irrigating their fields from the river. The  variety and number of fish has been decimated and the health of thousands of  inhabitants endangered, it said.
Some enterprises would be shut down while others would be made to set up  waste water treatment plants and renovate the polluting plants, the paper  quoted the team a saying, adding that all riverside towns must build waste  water disposal facilities by 2000.
Rapid economic reform has taken a serious toll on China's environment, in  part because of lack of regulation of the thousands of small-scale rural  enterprises, which are operating with backward equipment.
