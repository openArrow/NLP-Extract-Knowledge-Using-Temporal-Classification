Roman Herzog, favourite in the race for president, is  is undeniably the most conservative of the four candidates.
Aged 60, with an imposing high-domed forehead and a glittering eye behind  metal-rimmed spectacles, he has the reputation of enjoying the good life and  and an ironic turn of phrase.
Herzog, a jurist by training, has been president of Germany's important  constitutional court since November 1987, which he joined as vice-president in  1983.
A member of the Christian Democrat Union (CDU) since 1970, he was born  April 5, 1934 at Landshut in Bavaria, the son of a museum curator, and is an  active protestant evangelist.
As education minister of Baden-Wuerttemberg, he distinguished himself by  taking the Latin matriculation examination anonymously to underline the  importance he attributes to study of the language, and passed brilliantly.
While in the region's interior ministry, he insisted that 300 student  demonstrators who occupied an American military intallation pay the 25,000  marks cost of the police operation to evacuate them.
He also introduced CS gas and rubber bullets for the regional police.
But despite the severity of his outlook, he has regard for the rules of  law, and the court he presides over has, for example, come out firmly in  favour of the right to demonstrate.
To questions of whether he is to the right or left, Herzog prefers to  reply with a riddle.
Asked his plans for the presidency, he invariably replies that his aim is  to be "a figure of unity" and "a champion of the citizen in the face of the  state and the parties".
Not the first choice of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and hesitant to throw his  hat in the ring when his name did come up as a late runner, he now looks the  perfect conservative candidate.
