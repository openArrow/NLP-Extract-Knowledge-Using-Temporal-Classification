World number one Miguel Indurain was given  an early shock in the Tour of Italy here on Sunday when Frenchman Armand de  las Cuevas won the opening day time trial.
De las Cuevas, 25, took the pink jersey by winning the 7km solo ride,  forcing Liege-Bastogne-Liege classic winner Russian Evgeni Berzin into second  by two seconds while race favourite Indurain lost five.
Italian big names Gianni Bugno and Claudio Chiappucci conceded 14secs and  28secs respectively.
Indurain, going for a hat-trick of Giro wins to match his Tour de France  successes, has based his major tour victories on time trial wins and was  expected to win here.
The morning stage was won by Endrio Leoni, who outsprinted fellow Italians  Giovanni Lombardi and Adriano Baffi to take the 86km run.
