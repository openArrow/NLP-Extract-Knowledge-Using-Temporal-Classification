Japan's NEC Corp. said Thursday it had returned to  the black with consolidated pre-tax earnings of 25.1 billion yen (244 million  dollars) for the year to March and a further rebound forecast for this year.
The country's top semiconductor maker, which suffered a pre-tax loss of  37.7 billion yen a year earlier, said global sales edged up 1.8 percent to  3,580 billion yen despite lower sales of computers and industrial electronic  systems.
NEC forecast a further improvement in worldwide earnings to 60 billion yen  in the current year with sales climbing to 3,720 billion yen.
"Although it is likely the Japanese economy will begin to recover in  fiscal 1995, the severe operating environment may continue owing to the  further rise of the yen and the acceleration of structural change in the  electronics market," the company said in a statement.
In the latest year, sales of industrial electronic items such as  computers, office equipment and communications equipment "showed overall  sluggishness, owing to reduce private-sector capital investment and weak  exports.
"In the electronic device sector, however, semiconductors such as memory  devices and colour liquid crystal displays saw favourable growth, but the good  results in this sector were dampened by reduced electronic component sales."
NEC said total sales of communications systems and equipment edged up 0.8  percent to 969 billion yen while sales of computers and industrial electronics  systems fell 0.4 percent to 1,782 billion yen.
Sales of electronic devices grew 10.8 percent to 656 billion yen and sales  of consumer electronics and other products rose 0.7 percent to 173 billion  yen. Overseas sales climbed 8.8 percent to 871 billion yen.
