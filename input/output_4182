The escudo came under heavy selling pressure on  Thursday and was quoted at 103.90 to the German mark from 103.523 at the close  on Wednesday.
The Bank of Portugal suspended its repurchase rate and its rate for  certificates of deposit.
The central bank made clear that it would make available 180 billion  escudos (about one billion dollars) to national banks. To manage this it set  up a tender arrangement to enable national banks to acquire funds at market  rates in exchange for treasury notes.
Market dealers said that this should avert an increase in interest rates  and they held that the overnight rate should remain at 12-15 percent.
The central bank had had to intervene four times on Wednesday to hold the  escudo at 103.5 to the mark in response to rumours, considered here to be  wild, of a political-financial scandal.
These false rumours had upset the foreign exchange market, but one dealer  said that they were not the only factor behind speculation against the escudo.
Early on Wednesday several foreign banks had borrowed escudos at one and  three months and this had pushed up rates.
