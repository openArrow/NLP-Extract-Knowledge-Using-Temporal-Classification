The daughter of assassinated Sri Lankan president  Ranasinghe Premadasa on Sunday demanded a fresh probe into the killing,  accusing the government of failing to carry out a proper investigation.
Dulanjalee Jayakody raised doubts over the government version that the  separatist Liberation Tigerts of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) used a suicide bomber to  blow up Premadasa and 24 others at a May Day rally last year.
"No proper investigation has been done so far," she said. "It is the duty  of any government to find out who killed its head of state. We still don't  know who did it."
The ruling United National Party (UNP) general secretary Gamini Wijesekera   confirmed that Jayakody had asked for a presidential commission to  investigation the assassination.
He said he had seen Premadasa's widow, Hema, and her children Dulanjalee  and Sajith, last week to discuss how the family could help the UNP in  November's presidential election.
The UNP, after its humiliating defeat at a recent local election, has been  wooing the Premadasa family and attempted to resurrect the former leader's  populist policies to win back votes.
"They realise they cannot win without the Premadasa image. No one other  than the members of the family can portray the Premadasa image... We are the  trustees of the Premadasa policies," Sajith said in an interview earlier this  month.
"No other section or faction can vouch for the continuation of these  policies," he added.
