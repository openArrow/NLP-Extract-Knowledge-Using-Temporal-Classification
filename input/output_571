The Moslem-dominated Bosnian army has captured a  strategic hill northwest of Tuzla after a three-day battle against Serb  forces, the Nordic Battalion of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) reported  Saturday.
The situation was calm Saturday, Major Thomas Aersson told AFP from Tuzla,  a major government-held town in the north. He said the hill was near Mount  Ozren.
Radio Sarajevo reported that government troops captured five villages in  the region Thursday, near Gracanica, about 30 kilometres (20 miles) northwest  of Tuzla.
Serb forces meanwhile closed the main road between Sarajevo airport and  the centre of the capital Saturday afternoon after one of their men was  seriously wounded by a sniper at a checkpoint on the road, an UNPROFOR officer  said.
The airport, which is under the control of the French Foreign Legion, can  also be reached via the suburb of Dobrinja but the UN forces avoid that route  because it entails their armoured cars snaking through winding, densely  populated streets.
France's ambassador to Bosnia-Hercegovina, Henri Jacolin, paid a visit  Saturday to 11 French aid workers under arrest by Bosnian Serbs since April 8  on charges of smuggling weapons to the government forces.
He told AFP he had taken "food, newspapers and clothes" to the 11, held by  Serb troops in Lukavica, an outlying suburb of Sarajevo.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said earlier this week he would find  a legal formula to allow the men to be freed, but Jacolin said he had been  unable to obtain any new details on when they might be released.
