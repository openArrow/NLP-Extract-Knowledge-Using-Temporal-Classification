The employers' organisation the Confederation of  British Industry (CBI) Friday upwardly revised its growth projections for  Britain for this year and next.
In its tri-monthly report, the CBI predicted 2.4 percent growth in 1994  and 2.5 percent in 1995, one tenth of a percentage point up on figures it  released in February.
Improved consumer demand and domestic investment lay behind the sunnier  outlook, despite tax increases in April, the CBI said.
Inflation would rise steadily, but within the government's one to four  percent guidelines, it said.
Leaving out house prices, annualised inflation would hit 2.9 percent by  the end of the year and 3.3 percent by the end of next year, the CBI said.
Interest rates would remain unchanged at 5.25 percent this year, rising to  six percent by the end of next.
Industrial production would rise by 2.7 percent this year and by 3.5  percent next year, while domestic spending would rise 2.5 percent this year  and 2.3 percent in 1995, the CBI forecast.
It also predicted a major leap in profits for industries outside the North  Sea oil and gas industries, with a 9.5 percent increase this year and  a 3.9  percent hike in profits next year.
