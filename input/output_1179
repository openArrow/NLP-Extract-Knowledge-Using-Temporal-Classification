Five persons working for the US television network  NBC were detained by police and questioned for two hours after the crew  interviewed dissident Wang Dan at his Beijing home, relatives of one of the  crew said.
The crew comprised an American, an Australian, a Filipino and a Chinese,  as well as a Tokyo-based Japanese who was the only one of the five without  Chinese accreditation, they said.
Relatives of Wang said about 10 police burst into his home at around 11:00  a.m. (0300 GMT) and asked the crew if they had official authorisation to carry  out the interview.
"As they did not have any, the police took them away, along with Wang  Dan," one said.
The NBC crew was taken to the central Beijing offices of a branch of the  police that is in charge of foreigners in China, and was released two hours  later.
Wang, held for an hour at a police station in his neighbourhood, said the  police wanted to know how the journalists had contacted him and what had been  said at the meeting.
He said the interview focussed on renewal of most-favoured-nation (MFN)  customs status by the United States, the state of human rights in China and  his private life.
