A watchdog panel has sniffed out wasteful  expenditure by the Indian government, which rented kennels for non-existent  police dogs, press reports said Monday.
The Comptroller and Auditor General of India found the government had  spent 550,000 rupees (18,500 dollars) on renting kennels sanctioned by a 1982  project, the Pioneer newspaper said.
But the kennels sited at airports in Madras and New Delhi had no canine  inmates, while in Calcutta two dogs deployed in May 1985 died the same year  and were not replaced, the newspaper said.
