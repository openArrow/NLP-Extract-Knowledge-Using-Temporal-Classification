The Israeli army sealed off the Gaza Strip from  Friday until May 29 following the killing of two soldiers, a military  spokesman announced Friday.
Chief of staff General Ehud Barak decided the measure, which stops  Palestinians but not Israelis from leaving the Strip, with the defence  ministry's authorization, the spokesman said.
Islamic gunmen shot the two sergeants dead at a roadblock near the main  Erez crossing point into Gaza before dawn.
The army said that on average 2,500 Palestinians had crossed daily to work  in Israel in the last week.
