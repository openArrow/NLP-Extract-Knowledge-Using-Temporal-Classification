Libya's foreign minister spent the weekend in Paris  on a private visit that infuriated relatives of people who died in a French  airliner bombing blamed on Tripoli, sources said.
It was not immediately known if the minister, Omar Al-Muntasser, met with  French government officials, the sources said.
Libya has been punished with UN trade sanctions in connection with the  French airliner bombing, the 1989 downing of an UTA jet over Chad that killed  170 people, and for the bombing of a PanAm jet over Lockerbie, Scotland in  1988 that claimed 270 lives.
The sanctions were first imposed in April 1992 and then tightened last  year.
The last time a Libyan foreign minister visited Paris was in 1991.
Francis Szpiner, a lawyer for relatives of the UTA bombing, protested the  minister's stay.
"This visit hits a raw nerve for relatives of victims of this terrorist  act," Szpiner told AFP. "If it was an official visit, it is scandalous. If it  was private, it should have been barred."
Libya has steafastly snubbed requests from France, Britain and the United  States to turn over Libyan suspects in the two airliner bombings.
