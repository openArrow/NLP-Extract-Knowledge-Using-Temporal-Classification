Two people were killed and three were  missing after a plane carrying out a medical evacuation crashed into the sea  off Tahiti early Friday, officials said here.
The Mitsubishi MU2B60 aircraft with a pilot, two doctors and two  Australian patients, crashed on its approach to Tahiti-Faaa airport after a  flight from Rarotonga, the capital of the Cook Islands, about 800 kilometers  (500 miles) West of here.
An air and sea search launched after the crash located the bodies of a  doctor and one of his patients, as well as the plane's fuselage, floating in  the water.
The twin-engined Air Oceania plane was taking the two Australians, who  were injured in a diving accident, to the region's only decompression chamber  in Papeete for treatment, airline officials said.
They were under the care of doctors Christophe Goube and Franck Chiche, of  the medical organisation, SOS Medicins, they added.
The cause of the crash is not clear, but an inquiry into the incident has  been launched by the authorities here.
The plane belonging to the two-year-old airline, was forced to make an  emergency landing on its belly at Tahiti Faaa several months ago, after the  undercarriage failed to lower, due to a fault in the hydraulic system. Ten  passengers were on board.
