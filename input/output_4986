Fifth-seeded Goran Ivanisevic staged a great escape  act worthy of Houdini on the Roland Garros centre-court here on Saturday to  beat up-and-coming Spaniard Alex Corretja and reach the last-sixteen of the  men's singles.
After several outbursts and racket-throwing, the volatile Croatian finally  clinched a dramatic 6-7 (3/7), 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-3 victory.
He now plays Italy's Andrea Gaudenzi who beat Arnaud Boetsch of France  after just ten games when the Frenchman was forced to retire with a groin  injury.
