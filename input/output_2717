Sampras said after his defeat: "I had him but let him go. I didn't make  him play the shots on the match points. I feel I played well enough to win but  I got a little mentally and physically tired after losing the second set.
"My serve wasn't there today, but it's difficult to serve in these  conditions, with heavy balls and damp clay. In Paris, I need to serve a much  higher percentage but I've had a good preparation and have played a lot of  matches and I think I'm ready."
Stich said: "It's a big thing to win against Pete but I'm not going to get  over-excited. Every win is good for the confidence but it doesn't mean I'm  going to win the French Open because I beat him.
"I played a very good match and stayed in there and didn't give up.
"For a long time Sampras made almost no mistakes and at the beginning he  put too much pressure on me because every ball came back with double speed.  But that changed in the second part of the match."
