A number of pilots and mechanics employed by the  French domestic Air Inter airline Monday called a 24-strike for Thursday, but  management said all flights would go ahead.
Unions claiming to represent 60 percent of Air Inter's pilots and  mechanics called for the June 2 strike to protest the planned deregulation of  Europe's airways which they fear will cut jobs.
Air Inter flights were grounded by a strike on May 17.
