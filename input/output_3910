President Francois Mitterrand on Wednesday insisted  he was opposed to any lifting of an arms embargo on ex-Yugoslavia, as pressure  groups lobbied in France for an end to the ban voted by the UN Security  Council.
Mitterrand, who spoke at a cabinet meeting, warned that allowing arms  deliveries could trigger an escalation of the Bosnian conflict that could "go  well beyond the Balkans," his spokesman Jean Musitelli said.
The French president, whose country Wednesday hosted peace talks by an  international contact group and the belligerents in the Bosnian war, also said  the "sole alternative to negotiation is war."
Mitterrand's own Socialist ally, Michel Rocard who heads the French  Socialist Party and the Socialist list for the June 12 European elections, has  publicly differed with the president, speaking out in favor of lifting the  embargo.
A group of French intellectuals has also threatened to present their own  list at the European elections if the mainstream lists do not call for  allowing arms deliveries to Bosnian Moslem government troops.
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic met with Rocard and other officials in  Paris Monday to plead this cause.
Rocard, a presidential hopeful, Wednesday urged that "negotiations still  be given a chance." But he said "elementary morality would imply that at least  if we cannot protect the Bosnians, we let them protect themselves."
The talks with the international contact group on Bosnia-Hercegovina took  place Wednesday in Talloires, a town in the French Alps just across the border  from Geneva.
The meeting aimed to reach an agreement on the future carve-up of  Bosnia-Hercegovina alongside a general four-month ceasefire, as a prelude to a  permanent peace.
Earlier Wednesday, Defense Minister Francois Leotard confirmed that the  French military contingent in former Yugoslavia would be dropped by 2,500 men  by the end of the year.
France, which forms the backbone of the UN force in ex-Yugoslavia, now has  6,800 troops there.
By the end of 1994, "we are going to drop the volume of our forces in  Bosnia and we are going to regroup them around Sarajevo," Leotard said on  French radio.
France, and later Britain, have both warned they would pull their forces  out of Bosnia if there is no breakthrough in the peace process. Britain has  about 3,000 troops in former Yugoslavia.
