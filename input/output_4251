Israel has delayed the release of hundreds of  Palestinian prisoners which had been expected on Thursday as part of this  month's agreement launching self-rule, military sources said.
But Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who is also defense minister, Chief of  Staff Ehud Barak and Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahak decided late Wednesday  to resume releases in about a week, the sources said.
Under the May 4 autonomy agreement signed in Cairo, Israel agreed to free  5,000 prisoners over five weeks. So far, 1,570 have been released, the sources  said.
They were freed in the two days following the accord, but a spokesman said  on May 6 that no more would be released until further order.
Before leaving jail, the prisoners are asked to sign a statement saying  they "support the Israeli-Palestinian peace proceess," and renounce all "acts  of violence and terrorism."
Some 700 have rejected the conditions and will not be set free, military  sources said.
According to an international humanitarian organization, 8,000  Palestinians still remain behind bars, including 700 held on criminal charges.
