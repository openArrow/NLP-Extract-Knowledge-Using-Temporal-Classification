The United States has expelled an Iraqi  diplomat for violating rules governing Iraqi diplomatic activities here, The  Washington Post said Thursday.
State Department officials quoted by the daily said that Adnan Malik, who  was reassigned here from the United Nations, was sending out news releases in  favor of lifting the UN economic embargo against his country, and hired and  fired staff members with no prior notification to US authorities.
The activities, which began within a week of Malik's transfer in February,  were in violation of rules set down by Washington after the 1991 Gulf War.
"He was attempting to function as a full-fledged diplomat," but was only  allowed to issue visas and renew passports, State Department spokesman Michale  McCurry told the daily.
Malik's wife and children have been allowed to remain in New York until  the end of the school year, a State Department official said.
