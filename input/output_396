The World Bank has approved loans for India  totaling 6.5 billion to seven billion dollars for the next three years,  officials said Friday.
The loans are less than the nine billion dollars approved for the previous  three-year period, but reflect the changing nature of the aid and improvements  in India's economy, said Heinz Vergin, the bank official in charge of India.
Bank officials noted that Indian economic growth reached 13 percent in  1992 and 1993. Inflation was 13 percent in 1993 and 5.3 percent in 1992.
Both economic growth and inflation are expected to be 10 percent next year.
The World Bank loans are no longer aimed at propping up India's currency  reserves, but financing specific economic projects, Vergin said.
In a related matter, the bank said its International Development  Association would provide a 117.8 million dollar credit to help fight  blindness in India.
The funds will allow some eight million Indians to undergo cataract  surgery between now and the year 2000, the bank said.
"This is the boldest effort yet to reduce blindness in a developing  country," said the bank's Donoso Clark. "The project's main focus will be on  restoring the sight of poor people, particularly women."
The bank said about one-third of the world's 35 million blind people live  in India, and that 40 percent of Indians blinded by cataracts were between 40  and 60 years old.
The World Bank has also funded programs to help reduce AIDS, leprosy,  tuberculosis and malaria in India, as well as several projects on child and  maternal health.
