sharply higher then lower. Cocoa rose higher on large-scale  speculative buying at the beginning of the week. On Tuesday, prices reached  their highest levels since February 1988, at 1,068 pounds per tonne.
Analysts predicted last week that cocoa would be the next market to be  touched by rises.
Prices then dropped lower, remaining around 1,000 pounds per tonne -- a  level that cocoa has not fallen through for five months.
The announcement of a drop in the world production deficit by analysts ED  and F Man, left the market cold. The deficit was predicted at around 150,000  tonnes compared with 164,000 tonnes previously.
COFFEE: peak and trough. Most dealers don't remember seeing a week of such  extreme highs and lows.
At the beginning of the week, massive speculative buying pushed prices up  to 2,350 dollars per tonne on Tuesday -- the highest level since the beginning  of 1987.
Prices then tumbled as quickly as they had risen as dealers indulged in  large-scale profit taking. Dealers said that if you considered that the price  of coffee has doubled in four months, there were massive profits to be made.
Coffee then dropped through the 2,000-dollar barrier on Friday, but  dealers said at this level, non-speculative buying by industrials should occur  and consolidate prices.
The general shortage of coffee, however, particularly of high-quality  robusta, continues to be felt on the market.
Dealers said the arrival of four million bags of coffee (at 60 kilograms  each) on the market, previously withheld by a retention plan, would have no  impact on the market for several months.
