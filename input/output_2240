Eight birdies and an eagle lifted Mark Brooks  to a 64 Thursday and the first-round lead in The Memorial golf tournament at  wind-whipped Muirfield Village Golf Club.
"It happens sometimes," he said. "When you have good greens and good  fairways, somebody is going to light it up. That's just the way it is out  here."
John Cook shared second place with Tom Lehman, the Masters runner-up, on  67.
Former US Open champion Scott Simpson was on 68, while a group on 69  included Australian Steve Elkington and South African David Frost.
Australian Greg Norman pitched in from 66 yards for an eagle to joine a  group on 70.
Tournament founder Jack Nicklaus bogeyed five holes in a row en route to a  75. England's Nick Faldo fared even worse, carding a 76.
Brooks, who has won three titles in 11 years on the tour, played the  par-five holes in five-under. He birdied five of his first eight to reach the  turn at 31.
"I got quite a bit ahead of the game," he said. "And after I got to  seven-under I was thinking I could get to nine- or ten-under."
A bogey at the 13th slowed his progress, but he briefly moved to  nine-under with an eagle three at the 15th, where he hit a two-iron to 35 feet  and made the putt.
He found another bunker at the 17th and took bogey to fall back to  eight-under.
Brooks said his 64 was predicted by the five-cent coin he used to mark his  ball -- minted in 1964. Does he plan to switch to a 1958 coin?
"No, but I sure try to stay away from anything marked 1980," he said.
