China warned Washington on Thursday against  attaching any conditions to the renewal of its preferential trading status  with the United States, stressing that such a move would be "unwise."
"The attaching of conditions will be unacceptable to the Chinese side,"  foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin told a weekly press briefing.
US President Bill Clinton is widely expected to renew China's  most-favoured-nation (MFN) status before the weekend but with limited  sanctions that could involve a ban on imports of weapons and ammunition made  by the Chinese military.
"The unilateral exertion of pressure and adoption of restrictive measures  with regard to trade ... is not in conformity with international practises,"  Wu said, adding that any decision to impose limited sanctions "would be  unwise."
"We hope that the US president will make a suitable decision," he said.
Wu refused to comment on what steps China would take should conditions be  attached to MFN.
Clinton warned last year that renewal of China's MFN status, which brings  the lowest available US tariffs on imports, depended on China showing "overall  significant progress" in human rights.
He outlined seven areas needing improvement before the June 3 deadline for  deciding on whether to maintain China's MFN status for another year, and asked  US Secretary of State Warren Christopher to make a report.
Clinton officials said Christopher found China had met the minimum  requirements in two areas: cooperation in ending the export of prison-made  goods and allowing relatives of some dissidents to leave the country.
Reacting to reports that Clinton might also seek to set up a US commission  to monitor China's progress on human rights, Wu said dialogue "can be  conducted with regard to the difference over the issue of human rights between  China and the United States."
However, he reiterated that China was opposed to any interference in its  intenal affairs.
China has repeatedly protested the linking of MFN renewal with the human  rights issue.
