Rescuers struggled late Saturday to  salvage a cargo of dangerous acids from the English Channel lost from a  sinking container vessel after it collided with another ship, maritime  officials said.
The Ming Fortune, of Taiwan, lost several of its containers overboard  after colliding with the refrigeration vessel Ariake, the French maritime  emergency centre here reported.
The ship was transporting dangerous substances including acids.
Rescuers were seeking to recover as many of the containers as possible  before nightfall, the centre said, adding that the operation would resume  Sunday with the help of French and British helicopters.
Earlier Saturday helicopters winched the 21 crew members of the Taiwanese  container vessel to the nearby Maltese cargo ship Steersman, which took them  to England.
The centre said the Ming Fortune was sinking after being badly holed in  the collision, adding that its captain and chief engineer had remained on  board to try to save the vessel and guide French and British salvage teams.
British coastguards said all members of both ships' crews had been  accounted for.
The Ariake, carrying a cargo of fruit, was taken under tow by the merchant  vessel Aberthauw toward Britain.
The collision between the Ming Fortune and the Ariake, which was variously  described as Japanese- and Panamanian-registered, occurred Saturday afternoon  in thick fog inside waters for which France has responsibility.
The French centre said the circumstances of the collision were unclear,  but added that human error was almost certainly a factor. A probe into the  incident has been launched.
It was the fifth such accident in the Channel or North Sea in five years.
