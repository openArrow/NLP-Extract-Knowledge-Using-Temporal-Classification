African National Congress secretary general  Cyril Ramaphosa was Tuesday elected to chair South Africa's Constitutional  Assembly -- the body that will give final shape to the new basic law.
The Constitutional Assembly consists of the 400-member National Assembly  and the 90-member Senate and it is charged with completing the new  constitution within the five year term of the government of national unity.
Ramaphosa was the ANC's chief negotiator in the arduous and complicated  democracy negotiations that wrote South Africa's current interim basic law,  which came into effect with last month's historic all-race election.
The deputy chair went to the National Party's former manpower minister  Leon Wessels, and both he and Ramaphosa were unopposed for their positions.
The high-profile Ramaphosa, 40, had chosen to remain outside Mandela's  national unity government when he lost out the coveted post of first deputy  president to ANC national chairman and international department head Thabo  Mbeki.
Ramaphosa said the first sitting of the Constitutional Assembly was the  "culmination of the many bitter struggles waged for democratic rule and the  embodiment of the vision shown by many that the final constitution should be  drafted by an elected body."
