Karl Wendlinger, who crashed in  practice at the Monaco Grand Prix last Thursday, was being brought out of his  coma, his formula one team Sauber Mercedes said here Wednesday.
"The process that started yesterday of bringing Karl Wendlinger slowly out  of his controlled deep sleep progresses as planned," a spokesman said.
Doctors at the Saint Roch hospital at Nice in France had kept Wendlinger  in an artifical coma to relieve pressure on his brain.
However, doctors were still reluctant to say if he would recover  completely.
His crash, following the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger in  Italy two weeks previously, caused motor racing authorities to bring in a  series of changes to formula one car designs to improve safety.
