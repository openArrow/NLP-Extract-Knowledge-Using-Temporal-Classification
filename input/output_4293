English double winners Manchester United were  poised to sign Blackburn Rovers defender David May on Thursday to strengthen  next season's European Cup challenge.
May, who has had talks with United manager Alex Feguson, is out of  contract with the Ewood Park club and has been unhappy with the new deal  offered to him by Rovers boss Kenny Dalglish.
The 23-year-old full-back, who supported United as a boy, was born in  Oldham and would therefore qualify as an Englishman in European Cup matches.
United, unexpectedly eliminated by Turkish champions Galatasaray in this  season's European Cup, have been hampered in such matches by the rule limiting  the number of foreign players.
Rovers, runners-up to United in the Premiership last season, are likely to  be looking for upwards of 1.5 million pounds for May, but if a fee could not  be agreed it would be decided by a tribunal.
United assistant manager Brian Kidd has agreed a new three-year contract  with the club.
Kidd, a star of United's 1968 European Cup winning side, said he had  received offers from rival clubs.
He had reportedly been targeted by former United captain Bryan Robson,  newly installed as manager at First Division Midlesbrough.
Manchester City mangager Brian Horton has made his Republic of Ireland  stars Terry Phelan and Alan Kernaghan, both 27, available for transfer.
Manchester-born Phelan joined City from Wimbledon for what was then a  British record transfer fee for a full-back of 2.5 million pounds.
Yorkshireman Kernaghan, Horton's first signing as a manager, cost the club  1.6 million pounds from Middlesbrough last September.
Former England captain Ray Wilkins, 37, has joined newly promoted Crystal  Palace as player coach.
Wilkins, given a free transfer by London Premiership rivals Queens Park  Rangers last week, had also been chased by Coventry City.
