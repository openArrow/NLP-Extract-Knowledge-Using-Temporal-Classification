Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii denied  Friday a news report that a "secret accord" to stop the dollar's fall had been  reached late April at a meeting of central bankers and finance ministers from  the Group of Seven (G7).
"There was no such accord," Fujii told a scheduled press conference.
Quoting unidentified international financial sources, the Mainichi  newspaper said Friday that the G7 agreed at the meeting in Washington to  maintain the dollar above the "psychologically important" 100-yen line against  the yen.
They decided to take action together to defend the dollar, partly in  response to a strong US request, the daily said.
Commenting on the currently stable dollar-yen exchange, Fujii said it  "reflected a basic idea of G7 nations closely contacting each other, based on  a view that sharp movements in one country's currency is undesirable."
The dollar opened at 104.15 yen in Tokyo on Friday, up 0.05 yen from the  previous day's finish of 104.10 yen.
The opening rate was slightly below New York's late Thursday quote of  104.22 yen.
The Group of Seven comprises Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,  Japan and the United States.
