Four members of two Liberian armed factions were  killed and 12 civilians injured when the lorry they were riding on ran over a  mine north of the port town of Buchanan, the defense ministry said Wednesday.
Those killed were a colonel of the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) and three  guerrillas in a recently emerged faction, the Liberian Peace Council (LPC),  ministry spokesman Arthur Dennis said.
The presence of an AFL general staff officer in the company of LPC  fighters has stirred up new suspicions that the AFL helped form the new armed  movement last September in a bid indirectly to pursue a conflict with  Liberia's main armed faction, the National Patriotic Front (NPFL).
But Dennis said "it is not the AFL that sent (the colonel) to the  territory. He went to the LPC-controlled area on his own."
The LPC, which currently controls the region on Liberia's central  coastline where the truck hit the mine, has declared that the NPFL is its  avowed enemy. It is not a party to a peace pact signed in July last year among  the NPFL, the AFL and a third faction, the United Liberation Movement (ULIMO).
Dennis said that 10 of the civilians travelling with the fighters when the  mine blast occurred Sunday had been taken to hospital in serious condition.
