Burma's National Convention, charged  with drafting a new constitution for the country, is a "farce" aimed at  keeping the ruling military junta in power, a top convention delegate said  Thursday.
"I have lost all faith in the National Convention," said Daniel Aung, who  has defected to the opposition, at a press conference in this opposition  stronghold near the Thai border, about 700 kilometres (420 miles) northwest of  Bangkok.
The press conference was held to mark the anniversary of Burma's 1990  elections, in which the opposition won a landslide victory against the  military junta, which then refused to recognize the election results.
Until last month, Aung was one of five leaders of a group of political  parties -- consisting of 99 deputies elected in the 1990 polls -- at the  convention.
He is the second delegate to the convention -- which has 750 members, 500  of whom are appointed by the ruling junta -- to have defected to the  opposition since work on the constitution began in January 1993.
Aung conceded delegates were able to speak freely during debates at the  convention, but said that the country's military leaders, who chair the  proceedings, paid no attention to the deliberations.
"The SLORC (State Law and Order Restoration Council) simply went ahead and  adopted the principles of its own choice," Aung said. "They just don't care."
Aung criticised the method for electing the country's next president which  were devised to "only allow the military to permanently monopolize executive  power."
The former party leader also warned visitors of forming false impressions  of Burma.
"Some foreign visitors in Rangoon might have the illusions that things in  Burma are improving," he said.
"On the surface, in Rangoon, it might be true ... however, nobody dares to  speak and it is because the whole population is still under the terror of  guns," Aung said.
He also criticised the policy of "constructive engagement" adopted by the  six member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  which calls for a rejection of western sanctions against the junta, or SLORC.
Backing Aung was General Bo Mya of the rebel Karen National Union, the  oldest and most powerful armed opposition group fighting against the SLORC.
The 67-year-old general, who is also president of the Democratic Alliance  of Burma -- comprised of rebel ethnic minority opposition groups -- denounced  the junta's call for a ceasefire with all rebel movements and rejected "any  political solution."
The SLORC has signed official ceasefire agreements with 10 of the  country's 12 rebel ethnic movements.
Bo Mya has demanded that the government recognise the rights of minorities.
The mainly Christian Karens, who are Burma's largest ethnic minority and  among the few groups that do not deal in opium, have adopted a defensive  strategy in dealing with the military junta, aimed at retaining their zones of  control.
