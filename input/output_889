About 50 members of an organization made up of the  mothers of soldiers who have died during their military service demonstrated  in central Moscow Monday to denounce "inhuman conditions" in the armed froces.
The organization, which has a membership of 10,000, said it would maintain   its protest campaign until June 15, the deadline for spring military  conscripts.
Students, who have so far been exempt from military service until the end  of their studies, are expected to be forced to fulfill their obligation this  year.
The mothers of soldiers have repeatedly asked the government to  investigate the deaths of several conscripts and want an increase in benefits  paid to their families. They are also seeking to abolish the mandatory service  or otherwise want the minimum 18-year-old age of conscripts to be raised.
"I am well aware of our movement's weakness up against the powerful  military-industrial sector but we no longer want to sacrifice our sons," said  Lubov Lymar, the head of the movement.
Members plan to demonstrate next week in front of the parliament building.  They have vowed to go on hunger strike unless the government responds to their  demands.
