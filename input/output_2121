Copper soared again on the London Metals Exchange  on Thursday, rising to a 17-month high as dealers anticipated another major  drawdown in stocks on Friday.
Copper jumped 50.5 dollars to close at 2,252.5 dollars per tonne -- a high  since December 1992.
Kevin Norrish, an analyst at the Commodities Research Unit, said the  market was anticipating a stocks' drawdown on Friday of between 10,000 and  15,000 tonnes, and that this had caused the immediate jump in prices.
He said that although Thursday's high's were speculative, copper had very  firm fundamentals with regular drawdowns in stocks and expected increases in  demand in Europe and the US.
On Tuesday, the red metal closed 43 dollars up at a high since February  1993 after a further massive draw-down in stocks.
Elsewhere, the metals remained largely unchanged, as Norrish said they did  not share the same fundamentals and had followed copper generally as high as  they dared.
Aluminium closed half a dollar higher at 1,379 dollars per tonne, nickel  was unchanged at 6,350 dollars per tonne and tin was 30 dollars lower at 5,650  dollars per tonne.
Lead fell two dollars to 494 dollars per tonne and zinc was down four  dollars at 989 dollars per tonne.
