The dollar was under pressure shortly after noon  here Tuesday in the absence of a Federal Reserve move to raise short-term  interest rates expected in the morning.
Paul Farrell, an executive at Chase Manhattan Bank, said traders were  seeking to push the dollar lower after 11:30 a.m. (1530 GMT), the time when  the Fed usually announces its monetary interventions.
"Right now the dollar is holding at 1.6620 DM," Farrell said.                    He added that operators were now expecting the Fed to tighten credit at  about 2:00 or 3:00 p.m.
Most traders predicted between a quarter to a half percentage point  increase in the federal funds rate -- the overnight interbank loan rate -- and  a half point rise in the discount rate, said a trader with a major European  bank in New York.
Gold, meanwhile, edged up to 383.50 dollars an ounce, up 50 cents from  late Monday.
At about 12:45 p.m. (1645 GMT), the dollar traded at 1.6645 German marks,  down from 1.6700 in the morning and 1.6735 late Monday.
Against the yen, it was quoted at 104.20, down from 104.45 in early  trading and 104.75 last night.
The greenback also lost ground against other major European currencies,  falling to 5.7065 French francs from 5.7370 late Monday, to 1.4152 Swiss  francs (1.4265) and to 0.6638 pound sterling (0.6653).
The Fed's Open-Market Committee, which sets US monetary policy for weeks  to come, began a closed-door meeting in Washington at 9:00 a.m. (1300 GMT).
