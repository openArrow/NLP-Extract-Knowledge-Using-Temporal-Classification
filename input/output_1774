Italian Senators Wednesday started a key vote on  whether to confirm in office the government of new Prime Minister Silvio  Berlusconi.
The poll which began at 8:30 p.m. (1830 GMT) was expected to last about an  hour.
During the voting procedure all 326 members (Eds: correct) of Italy's  upper house were being called by name in alphabetical order.
Berlusconi's rightist Forza Italia and his allies of the neo-fascist  National Alliance and federalist Northern League have no absolute majority in  the Senate but defectors from other centrist parties were expected to vote for  the government.
Berlusconi, a media magnate-turned politician, Wednesday rejected calls  from conservative and centrist senators to get rid of the five members of the  neo-fascist National Alliance in his government.
If Berlusconi fails to muster the needed votes, his government would  collapse, forcing President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to ask him either to form a  new cabinet or call new elections that could plunge the country into crisis.
But analysts and the Italian media said that scenario was unlikely as  Italy's former Christian Democrat leaders who hold the deciding Senate votes  would not want to be blamed for such an outcome.
They said Berlusconi's best chance of winning the vote was if several of  the opposing senators from the Italian Popular Party (PPI), the former  Christian Democrats, simply walk out of the room, as several have hinted they  may do.
Forza Italia and its coalition partners hold an absolute majority in the  lower chamber of parliament which must also vote in the government.
