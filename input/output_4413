"This will help assure that businesses can continue to advance these  causes by employing Chinese citizens in good, well-paying jobs, affording them  a higher standard of living and exposing them to American practices and  values."
In renewing China's MFN status for another year, Clinton also slapped a  ban on imports of Chinese munitions and called for US firms doing business in  China to develop a "voluntary set of principles" regarding human rights.
But the Chamber of Commerce rejected the need for a code of conduct,  saying "by their behavior US companies have demonstrated consistently that  they are part of the human rights solution, not the problem."
Human rights activists felt let down that Clinton had backtracked from his  tough talk of a year ago when he pledged that China's trade privileges would  not be renewed without "significant progress" on human rights.
"I'm disappointed with the president's position. The president has missed  an historic opportunity to bring about fundamental change in China and Tibet,"  said Lodi Gyari, president of the International Campaign for Tibet.
Gyari added that he was pleased Clinton acknowledged Beijing had made no  progress on Tibet, which China annexed in 1951.
He said he was willing to give the administration the benefit of the doubt  on its promises to continue to demand that China improve its rights record.
"I hope that this is just a change of tactics and not a change of policy,"  Gyari said.
