The army lifted a week-long closure  of the Gaza Strip on Friday after the Palestinian police set up new  checkpoints to process Arab workers travelling into Israel.
The army sealed off the Strip after two soldiers were killed at a  checkpoint by Palestinian gunmen last Friday.
It said the new Palestinian police had to prevent gunmen reaching the  Israeli side of the boundary.
Some 2,000 Palestinians passed through the new police checkpoints on  Friday morning and no incidents were reported.
