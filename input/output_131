A member of Israel's proxy militia was  killed and two others were wounded Friday in a remote-controlled bomb attack  in Israel's security zone in south Lebanon, the South Lebanon Army (SLA) said.
The bomb was detonated as their patrol drove along a road on the edge of  the zone, the militia said.
SLA gunners retaliated by pounding the Kfarhune village facing the zone,  where Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas are entrenched.
Guerrillas fired a surface-to-air SAM-7 missile Wednesday at an Israeli  helicopter as it circled over Kfarhune, but missed.
