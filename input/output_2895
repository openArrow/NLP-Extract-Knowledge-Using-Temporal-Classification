Endrio Leoni outsprinted fellow Italians  Giovanni Lombardi and Adriano Baffi to take the leader's pink jersey in the  Tour of Italy here Sunday after the 86km first section of the opening stage.
The riders have a 7km time-trial later in the day when Spain's Miguel  Indurain will start his challenge for a third Giro triumph to equal his Tour  de France hat-trick.
