South Korea launched its fourth submarine Saturday,  a domestically-built, diesel-powered vessel which the navy said had the  capacity to travel twice as fast as those operated by North Korea.
The national Yonhap news agency said the 1,200 tonne "Pakwi-Ham" built by  Daewoo Shipyard and designed by Germany's HDW, was commissioned at a  traditional ceremony on Koje Island.
The submarine, which carries a crew of 30, torpedoes and mines, is capable  of a maximum speed of 22 knots, and can operate independently for two months,  Yonhap quoted naval officials as saying.
The other three submrines operated by South Korea are all diesel-powered,  built with HWD technology.
North Korea is believed to have 26 submarines in its eastern and western  fleets.
