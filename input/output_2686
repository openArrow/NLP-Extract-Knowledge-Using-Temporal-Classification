Heavy rain looked set to wash out the second one  day international match between England and New Zealand at Lord's on Saturday.
No play was possible in the morning and umpires have decided on a further  inspection at 13.00h GMT.
However, with more rain forecast throughout the afternoon, it seems more  likely the match will be rescheduled for Sunday.
Side strain victim Darren Gough, 23, who took two key wickets amid a fine  debut display of swing bowling in England's 42-run victory in the first  international at Birmingham on Thursday, will definitely be missing from the  home side when play gets under way.
