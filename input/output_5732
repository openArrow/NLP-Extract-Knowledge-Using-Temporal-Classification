Wigan's expensive All Black import  Va'aiga Tuigamala has been left on the reserves bench for Wednesday night's  world club rugby league championship match with the Brisbane Broncos.
The 120kilo winger, who defected from New Zealand rugby union last year,  has made way for youngster Jason Robinson as the league world's top two clubs  vie for the 400,000 dollars (288,000 US) winner-take-all stake.
Robinson, who played in Wigan's premiership final win less than a  fortnight ago and who was voted England's young player of the year in 1992,  held his spot ahead of Tuigamala, who has trained in the forwards this week.
Wigan coach Graeme West is expected to use Tuigamala's massive frame as an  extra forward at some stage on Wednesday night.
Wigan team-mates Sam Panapa and Bill McGinty will be hoping to leave the  glamour English club as big winners after already sharing in three major  victories back home this year.
The Regal Trophy was the only piece of rugby league silverware to elude  the Cherry and Whites this year.
Both will play their last games for the champion English club with New  Zealander Panapa set to join Salford next season and McGinty returning to  Warrington.
