Bosnian Serb forces Wednesday carried out  intensive bombardments of Bihac, a Moslem pocket in northwest  Bosnia-Hercegovina, UN Protection Force spokesman Major Rob Annink said here.
The bombing of Bihac and Cazin, further north, killed one person and  wounded several others, Radio Sarajevo said.
Major Annink said the Serbs had launched some 300 to 500 shells from  positions on the Grabez plateau, east of the mainly Moslem town of Bihac.
The Bihac region is strategically important, situated at the crossroads of  rail routes from the Serb-controlled Krajina region of Croatia through to  Serb-held western Bosnia.
Radio Sarajevo said the Serbs continued their shelling of Moslem  frontlines on the Grabez and Grmusa plateaux. They also launched an infantry  attack which was repulsed, the radio said.
In Talloires, France, Wednesday, Bosnian government and Croat leaders at  all-party Bosnia peace talks agreed to negotiate dividing up the  Bosnia-Hercogovina republic on the basis of percentages set by their French  hosts, a Croat source said.
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, Vice President Ejup Ganic, and  Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir Zubak agreed to base further discussions on the  51 percent of territory earmarked for their federation by the international  contact group hosting the talks, said the source.
The source was a member of the Croat press contingent who said he had  gained access to the closed-door meeting.
There was no official comment late Wednesday from the Moslem-Croat camp on  the state of negotiations, which resume Thursday for their second and final  day.
To date, the Moslem-Croat federation, which presently controls 30 percent  of Bosnia, has held out for 58 percent.
The contact group has set aside the remaining 49 percent for the Bosnian  Serbs, who currently occupy more than 70 percent and who are represented at  the meeting by the leader of their self-proclaimed parliament, Momcilo  Krajisnik.
