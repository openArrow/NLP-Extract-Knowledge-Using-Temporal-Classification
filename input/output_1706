A first-time US filmmaker brought the glitz  of Cannes down to earth Wednesday, presenting his debut at the world's biggest  filmfest among the food shelves at a local supermarket.
"Clerks" by 23-year-old Kevin Smith is in the running for the Golden  Camera competion for first-timers here.
Presenting the black and white film, about a New Jersey convenience store  and the exploits, sexual and otherwise, of its clientele, Smith said he had  been interested in bargains since working in a small grocery store himself.
Hosting a press conference from the cash till at Monoprix, he said that  even if his first offering brought in offers of greater things he would  "always try to keep the budget as low as possible."
The film is among the bargains in more ways than one: whereas many of the  movies shown on the Croisette cost millions of dollars to make, "Clerks" had a  budget of just 27,000 dollars.
