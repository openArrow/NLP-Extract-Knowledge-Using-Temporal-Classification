President Bill Clinton on Friday selected  Stephen Breyer, a Massachusetts federal judge, as his nominee to the US  Supreme Court.
Breyer, 55, seen as a moderate consensus-builder, had been favored by  Clinton last year before he named Ruth Ginsburg. He heads the federal appeals  court in Boston.
Clinton said Breyer represents "excellence in knowldge, excellence in  judgement" and added, "Without dispute he is one of the outstanding jurists of  our age."
Clinton's decision ended days of speculation over the nominee to replace  85-year-old Justice Harry Blackmun, who is retiring from the highest US court  -- one of the three centers of power under the US constitution.
Named for life, the nine Supreme Court justices have a huge role in  determining the course of American society.
In recent decades, the court has ended segregation, given blacks political  power, legalized abortion and restored the death pena, rulings which will have  a lasting impact on the country.
