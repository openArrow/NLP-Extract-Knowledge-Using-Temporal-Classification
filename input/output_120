Japan will send its top trade negotiators to the  United States as early as next week in a bid to break the impasse in stalled  talks, International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata said Friday.
The announcement followed reports that the United States had softened its  tough stance in the talks, which collapsed in February.
Asked if this was the case, Hata told a news conference: "Rather than  softening, it's better to think that the atmosphere is such that both sides  must do their best."
The negotiators going to Washington were named as Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice  minister for international affairs at the international trade and industry  ministry, and Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy foreign minister for economic affairs.
Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told a separate news conference the  government had decided to accelerate moves toward an early resumption of the  talks.
The decision came during his meeting earlier Friday with Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumazai, he said.
But Kakizawa said Washington had requested that Tokyo avoid discussing  details of the negotiations in public for the time being.
"The American side asked us not to make disclosure until the resumption of  the talks," he said.
