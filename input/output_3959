Steffi Graf and Pete Sampras didn't play their best  tennis but they still won their second-round matches without dropping a set as  the French Open Tennis Championships held their annual "Children's Day' on  Wednesday.
Sampras, 22 and bidding for a mid-season 'Grand Slam' after his triumphs  at last year's Wimbledon and United States Open and this year's Australian  Open, was forced to shift up a gear when he faced world junior champion  Marcelo Rios of Chile.
The quiet American, who has never won at Roland Garros, finally clinched a  7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (7/4), 6-4 victory in two and a half hours on a centre-court  which needed protection from morning rain but which was basking in fierce  sunshine by late afternoon.
He was made to work hard by the 18-year-old Rios who joined the senior  tour just two months ago and who had to qualify to make the main draw in Paris.
"You have to give him a lot of credit," said the world number-one, adding:  "He wasn't nervous or intimidated and he certainly had a good first serve and  backhand. He had nothing to lose and he came out swinging -- and that's the  way it should be."
"I didn't play that great. I wasn't hitting deep enough and it took a  while to get used to the way he plays.
Sampras said that the morning rain and damp which delayed the start of  play by an hour, had left the court heavier and slower than on the first day.  It was much slower than at Rome.
"But I hung in there and got the job done."
Asked if he had been distracted by the thousands of children who invade  the famous stadium on the first Wednesday of the tournament, Sampras shook his  head.
"It's a great idea. I wish other tournaments had a day like this. There's  a bit more waiting around because they get excited and we need to wait for  silence. And the Wednesday in Paris is a long day. But I'm all for attracting  kids to watch tennis.
"Mind you," he reflected, "the New York kids might be even noisier than  the French kids."
