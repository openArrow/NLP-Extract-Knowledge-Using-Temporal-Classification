Under the constitution, the popular Weizsaecker, 74, must <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="must">retire</EVENT> by <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE">June  30</TIMEX3> after <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">serving</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION">two five-year</TIMEX3> terms, and five candidates are <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">vying</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">succeed</EVENT>  him in what promises to be a close vote.&#13;
The winner, who will be the first president <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">elected</EVENT> by representatives of  the reunited Germany, and the seventh head of state of post-war, federal  Germany, <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">takes</EVENT> office on <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE">July 1</TIMEX3> in a crucial <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE">political year</TIMEX3>.&#13;
A largely honorific post, it is nevertheless being hotly <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">contested</EVENT> by the  political parties, as its outcome will be <EVENT eid="e12" class="PERCEPTION" tense="FUTURE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">seen</EVENT> as a pointer for federal  legislative elections on <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE">October 16</TIMEX3>.&#13;
Strict security was in force around the Reichstag in Berlin where the  assembly was <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">taking</EVENT> place, with the historic building <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">sealed</EVENT> off by hundreds  of police.&#13;
Members of the <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION">one-day</TIMEX3> assembly, <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">consisting</EVENT> of the 662 members of the  federal parliament and an equal number of party-nominated delegates of the 16  regional parliaments, were <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">casting</EVENT> their secret ballots in up to three rounds.&#13;
Five candidates are in the running, with the late entry of the far-right  Republicans party, but the race is <EVENT eid="e17" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">expected</EVENT> to be between the <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">ruling</EVENT> party's  Roman Herzog and the opposition's Johannes Rau.&#13;
Herzog, 60, the candidate of the Christian Union parties <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">led</EVENT> by Chancellor  Helmut Kohl, is the favourite and chairman of the constitutional court.&#13;
Rau, 63, of the Social Democrats, is premier of the important state of  North Rhine-Westphalia and a regional party baron.&#13;
<EVENT eid="e20" class="REPORTING" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">According</EVENT> to opinion polls, Rau rather than Herzog would <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="would">win</EVENT> if the  president were <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">elected</EVENT> by universal suffrage.&#13;
But the outcome is <EVENT eid="e23" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">expected</EVENT> to be <EVENT eid="e24" class="I_ACTION" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">determined</EVENT> by the minority Free  Democrats, who have their own candidate, Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher, 73. Their  votes could <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="could">split</EVENT> if and when she is <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">obliged</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">withdraw</EVENT>.&#13;
In the first two rounds of voting, an absolute majority is <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">required</EVENT>, but  on the third a simple majority will <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="FUTURE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">suffice</EVENT>, and the Christian Union parties  have more votes at their disposal than the Social Democrats.&#13;
There is also an independent from former East Germany standing with the  support of the Greens party, Jens Reich, 55, but he is an outsider.&#13;
In <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">presenting</EVENT> their no-hoper Hans Hirzel, 69, the far-right Republicans,  who <EVENT eid="e31" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">need</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">counter</EVENT> their extreme racist image, have <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">chosen</EVENT> a man reputed to  have been in the anti-Nazi resistance.&#13;
The Reps, as they are <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">known</EVENT>, are <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">led</EVENT> by former Waffen SS officer Franz  Schoenhuber.&#13;
The vote is difficult to <EVENT eid="e36" class="I_ACTION" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">predict</EVENT>. The Christian Democratic Union-Christian  Social Union has 619 of the 1,324 votes at their disposal, the Social  Democrats 502 and the Free Democrats 111.&#13;
The Alliance90/Greens grouping has 43 votes and the ex-communist  Democratic Socialists 33. The Republicans have eight votes and there are also  eight miscellaneous.&#13;
Although the ballot is a secret and slow process, with each participant  being <EVENT eid="e37" class="I_ACTION" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">called</EVENT> by name to <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">cast</EVENT> his or her ballot, party choices are <EVENT eid="e39" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">expected</EVENT> to  be <EVENT eid="e40" class="I_ACTION" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">determined</EVENT> by horse-trading on the sidelines.&#13;
But the regional delegates, while party-chosen <EVENT eid="e41" class="REPORTING" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">according</EVENT> to regional  parliament strength, are not necessarily political figures. They include, for  example, Olympic ski champion Katja Seizinger, as well as an astronaut and a  classical trumpeter.&#13;
