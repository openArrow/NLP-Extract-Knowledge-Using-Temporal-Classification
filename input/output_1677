Pilots from three UN aircraft refused Wednesday  to run the gauntlet of Serb gunners at Tuzla airport, shelled a day earlier by  Serb forces, as NATO warplanes kept watch over the besieged Bosnian enclave.
The UN Protection Force had scheduled three flights to ferry in radar  equipment into the Moslem city in northeastern Bosnia, but a UN spokesman said  the pilots refused to take off from Zagreb after the Serbs shelled the  airstrip Tuesday just as a UN plane landed.
The pilots "refused to take off because of the danger," UNPROFOR spokesman  Major Rob Annink in Sarajevo said. He added the pilots were "civilians hired  by UNPROFOR" while the planes were Ukrainian Ilyushin-76s.
He said it was very likely no United Nations plane would land at Tuzla  during the day because the "latest time for take-off is 1700" (15H00 GMT).
The three UN planes had been expected to bring in five pieces of US-made  radar equipment radar to provide more detailed information about how many  shells landed and where they were fired from.
Annink refused to say whether NATO warplanes would take retaliatory action  if there were more Serb shelling, saying: "To use close air support is a big  step."
"The international community has not allowed it yet," he added.
When Tuesday's shooting occurred, a NATO plane was at hand and procedures  to scramble it were put in motion, Major Annink said.
But Lieutenant General Michael Rose, UNPROFOR military chief in Bosnia,  and Yasushi Akashi, special envoy of UN secretary-general Boutros  Boutros-Ghali "made the decision not to request air support," Annink added.
The Bosnian Serbs, whose forces surround the airport, said they had  received no advance notice of the UN plane's arrival at Tuzla.
