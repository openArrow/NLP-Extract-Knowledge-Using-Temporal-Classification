A man jumped off a balcony onto the floor of the  Iranian parliament on Tuesday after he was denied a meeting with speaker Ali  Akbar Nategh Nuri.
The man, 24, was slightly injured and taken to hospital after he made the  five to six meter (20 feet) jump during a session of parliament.
Speaking to journalists after the incident, Nategh Nuri said the man "is  not normal and has apparently psychiatric problems."
"He started shouting that he wanted to see me and talk to me. Then he  threatened to throw himself off the balcony if I did not let him. I asked him  to wait for the end of the session, then he jumped," he said.
