Most of Egypt's 180,000 lawyers went on strike  Sunday to protest the death of a jailed lawyer who was allegedly tortured.
Abdel Hareth Madani died the day after being arrested on April 26 on  charges that he had acted as a go-between for imprisoned members of the  Islamic militant group Jamaa Islamiyya group and those abroad.
The Egyptian lawyers, who normally work on Sundays, also plan a protest  march on a palace of President Hosni Mubarak on Tuesday.
They have demanded the release of 34 lawyers held without charge and to  take part in an inquiry into Madani's death.
The prosecutor's office said Thursday that an initial autopsy showed the  lawyer had died after being tortured.
But the interior ministry said two days later that Madani had died from an  asthma attack before even being questioned.
It said his asthma attack had started at his home where he had been taken  by security services and that Madani was immediately brought to hospital where  he later died.
But his family was only told of his death on May 6.
The ministry said Madani had been a "terrorist leader" of Jamaa, which has  waged a two-year-long campaign of violence against the government, and that it  had documents to prove the allegation.
Mukhtar Nuh, a member of the bar association, rejected the explanation  that Madani had died of natural causes, saying if that were true "the security  services would not have waited nine days to inform his family."
"Even if he was accused of belonging to an armed group, that doesn't give  the state the right to kill him," added Nuh, whose association is dominated by  the Moslem Brotherhood.
