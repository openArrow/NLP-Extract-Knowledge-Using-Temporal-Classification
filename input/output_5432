Brimming with confidence after a strong showing  in parliamentary by-elections, India's ruling Congress (I) party on Monday  ruled out an early general election.
"There is no question of early general elections," party spokesman Vithal  Gadgil said, describing the outcome of the May 26 by-elections as "a renewed  vote of confidence in the leadership of (Prime Minister) P.V. Narasimha Rao."
"We are grateful to the electorate for backing the Congress," he added.
The Congress won five of the eight seats in parliament and five of the 10  state assembly seats which were at stake in by-elections seen as a popularity  test ahead of elections due in 10 Indian states in late 1994 and early 1995.
State assembly elections are to be held in Rao's home state of Andhra  Pradesh and Goa, Karnataka and Sikkim by November, and in Gujarat,  Maharashtra, Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Manipur and Orissa by March next year.
The May 26 poll boosted the Congress tally in the 545-seat parliament to  269. Rao is not required to call a general election until 1996.
