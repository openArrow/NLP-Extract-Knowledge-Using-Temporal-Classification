Ukrainian deputies began a two-day debate in  parliament Tuesday to elect a speaker, with a centrist and a socialist said to  be the favored candidates.
The deputies are considering a list of nine candidates, among them  centrist deputy Vassily Durdinets and socialist deputy Alexandre Moroz, both  of whom enjoy the backing of various groups in parliament.
Moroz is supported by moderate reformers close to Leonid Kuchma, who  stands a good chance of winning the presidential poll in June and is in favour  of closer relations with Russia.
Other candidates for the speakers' post include a communist, two  nationalists and a member of an extremist organisation.
The full parliament has 450 seats but only 336 deputies were elected  during elections in March and July. The remainder are to be chosen during  elections in July.
