Matthias Sammer and Stefan Effenberg will occupy the holding spots in  midfield to allow Moller to get forward. Buchwald, who moves to Japan's Urawa  Red Diamonds next season, could also be pushed into the midfield to add much  needed grit and steel.
Vogts also has a dilemma over keepers Andreas Kopke and Bodo Illgner.  Kopke, Vogts original number one choice, is being threatened by the often more  impressive Illgner, who played in Italy but lost his place after a poor 1992  European championships.
The German coach is under no illusions about how difficult his task is and  has even tipped Brazil as likely winners.
"For me, the Brazilians are the top dogs and favourites," he said. "I am  not that arrogant to claim that we are the world's best."
For all their problems, nobody will be writing the Germans off. With three  World Cup wins and three runners-up spots they are they most succesful nation  in World Cup history and few would bet against them making at least the last  four.
As champions, Germany kick off the World Cup in Chicago's 67,000-capacity  Soldier Field Stadium against Bolivia. Group C matches against Spain and South  Korea follow and should see them comfortably into the second round.
