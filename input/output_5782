Moslems held special mass prayers for rains as a  water crisis gripped the Pakistani capital and the death toll from a heat wave  sweeping the country rose Tuesday to 26.
Hundreds of residents joined the prayers at the International Islamic  University compound here, while the authorities marshalled a fleet of tankers  to deliver potable water to homes.
The normal supply of piped water to the capital's 300,000 people has been  disrupted by the virtual drying up of a nearby dam reservoir because of a  prolonged drought.
During a demonstration triggered by the water shortage here Sunday, one  man was killed and dozens injured in a clash with police. Earlier, two people  were reportedly shot dead by police during a similar protest in Karachi.
Reports said 10 people have died from heat at Shorkot and Bachal Shah  Miani in southern Sind province, where temperatures exceeded 45 degree Celsius  (113 F) at several places, with the city of Jacobabad recording 47.7 degree  Celsius (117 F).
Sixteen deaths from the scorching heat spell have been reported from the  most populous province of Punjab.
