They "may be required to take action in self-defence against persons or  groups who threaten protected sites and populations, United Nations or other  humanitarian personnel or the means of delivery and distribution of  humanitarian relief," according to a resolution adopted by the Security  Council on Tuesday.
But the UN, still reeling from its failure to end anarchy in Somalia and  facing US reluctance to embark on another hazardous mission in Africa, did not  empower the Rwanda force to launch Somalia-style offensive "peacemaking"  operations.
Kabia said that if the new force had been in place, it could have  prevented the massacre of 10 children and a Rwandan woman working for the UN  Children's Fund (UNICEF).
UN officials found their dismembered bodies in the woman's central Kigali  house Tuesday. Five of the victims were her children, while she was sheltering  the others, Kabia said.
"Civilians armed with guns, grenades and machetes entered the house and  hacked the victims to death," Kabia said.
He said he did not know whether the dead were from the minority Tutsi  tribe that has borne the brunt of six weeks of the bloodletting unleashed when  Habyarimana died in what his followers said was a rocket attack on his plane  by the predominantly Tutsi rebels.
Extremist militias from the majority Hutu tribe which dominates the  government have been blamed for much of the killing.
But the rebels, who advanced on Kigali as militia death squads rampaged  through the tiny central African country bludgeoning and hacking to death  Tutsis and Hutu opposition supporters, have also been accused of wanton  slaughter by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
