Japanese carmaker Daihatsu Motor Corp. Ltd.  announced Friday a pre-tax profit of 2.4 billion yen (23 million dollars) for  the year to March, reversing a loss of 4.4 billion yen a year earlier.
The minicar affiliate of Toyota Motor Corp. said the return to the black  mainly reflected cost-cutting measures. Sales, adversely affected by the  stronger yen, fell 6.8 percent to 731 billion yen.
Daihatsu forecast higher earings of four billion yen in the current year  with revenue edging down to 730 billion yen.
