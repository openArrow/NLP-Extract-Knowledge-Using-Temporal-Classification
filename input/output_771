Venice and Sarajevo became twin cities  Sunday.
"Venice wanted this twinning to express the deep bitterness of our  country, and I hope of all Europe, over what is happening in the entire Balkan  region, and the unacceptability of current European impotence," said Venice  mayor Massimo Cacciari after a signing ceremony here.
Said Bosnian consul to Milan Mohamed Kreseulyakovic, a former Sarajevo  mayor: "Don't be fooled by the television cover of Sarajevo over the past few  weeks; the situation is still dramatic and shooting is continuing."
Venice has already offered scholarships to Sarajevo students to study at  its university.
