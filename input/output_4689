Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said  Friday that the US economy showed no signs of an inflation problem.
Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Greenspan said the economy  did not present "widespread indications" of resurging inflation.
"To date, underlying cost increases have been absorbed with little  evidence that they have yet passed through into prices for final products," he  said.
"If we are successful in our current endeavor there will not be an  increase in overall inflation," he said, referring to the Fed's four interest  rates hikes since February to ward off inflationary pressures.
