Israeli undercover troops shot  dead two wanted Moslem fundamentalists just north of Jerusalem on Tuesday,  witnesses and military officials said.
The officials said two senior members of the Islamic Resistance Movement  HAMAS died in a military operation on the West Bank.
Palestinian witnesses described a cold-blooded killing of apparently  unarmed men.
As they got off a bus in the Ar-Ram district, a Ford transit van bearing  an Israeli flag pulled up close-by, Palestinian witnesses told AFP.
Two Israeli soldiers in jeans and T-shirts jumped out of the van, hailed  the Palestinians and opened fire as they turned round.
The Israelis climbed back into the van where three colleagues waited and  sped off, the witnesses said.
"The van drove off towards an Israeli military base," said eye-witness  Adel Abu Sniya, 34 ans.
Uniformed Israeli troops carried off the two corpses before ambulances  arrived.
"A few minutes later soldiers and border police in jeeps arrived. They  took the bodies and quickly cleaned up before pulling out."
However an AFP reporter watched Palestinians picking through pieces of  flesh and skull as well as bullet casings and white surgical gloves which were  strewn around.
The dead men were not known in the district, the witnesses said.
Their deaths brought to 1,275 the number of Palestinians shot by Israeli  bullets since the uprising against Israeli rule began in December 1987.
Meanwhile on the Gaza Strip, Palestinians opened fire on an Israeli army  post near the settlement of Ganei Tal, Palestinian sources said.
No one was reported injured.
The gunmen drove off into Khan Yunes, which is under Palestinian police  control.
