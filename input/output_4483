Taiwan's economy was showing signs of steady  growth, with the government's key economic barometer flashing an encouraging  "green light" for April, a government agency said in a report Friday.
"The economy in April remained promising and registered a fifth  consecutive green light, with the composite rating advancing to 26 points from  24 points in March," the Council for Economic Planing and Development (CEPD)  said.
The point system, designed by the CEPD, measures the economy based on nine  major indicators -- export value, stock prices, check default rate, export  orders, money supply, industrial production index, banking lending, factory  inventories and non-farming employment.
A green light, which requires a minimum score of 23, means robust economy  activity. Red means the economy is overheated. Yellow-red signals brisk  economic growth, yellow-blue shows economic slowdown, and blue means recession.
The CEPD attributed the economic upswing in April mainly to increased  export orders and improved factory inventories.
Taiwan chalked up 7.8 billion US dollars worth of overseas business orders  in April, a 9.03 percent jump over the corresponding period last year.
According to a survey by the CEPD, 63 percent of local firms expect the  business climate to remain the same for the next three months, 24 percent  predict the economy will be better, while a 13 percent said it would get worse.
