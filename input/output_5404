Malawi's new President Bakili Muluzi on Tuesday  begins a four-nation "solidarity" visit to Botswana, Mozambique, Zambia and  Zimbabwe, the External Affairs ministry said Monday.
The visit, Muluzi's first outside the country since being sworn-in as  president last week after Malawi's first multi-party elections, is expected to  end Thursday.
The four countries, plus Angola, Lesotho, Namibia, Malawi, Swaziland and  Tanzania, form a regional economic grouping, the Southern African Development  Community (SADC).
