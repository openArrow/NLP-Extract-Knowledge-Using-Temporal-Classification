Vietnam said Saturday it was pleased US President  Bill Clinton had decided to separate the issues of trade and human rights when  agreeing to renew China's most-favoured-nation trading status.
A foreign ministry spokesman said the decision Thursday to renew China's  status "was realistic and conforms with current norms in international  relations.
"World opinion has for a long time vigorously argued against linking  economic relations with human rights," he added.
Hanoi has agreed to discuss human rights in Vietnam with Washington and  held a first round of talks in March in New York, but has repeatedly refused  to allow any "interference in internal affairs," which it considers human  rights to be.
Vietnam and the United States agreed this week to open official liaison  offices in each other's capitals, the first step in normalising relations  after nearly 20 years.
