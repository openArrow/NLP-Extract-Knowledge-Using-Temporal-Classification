Sunburned, poisoned, drowned, slaughtered and  starved, the world's sea mammals face extinction by the end of the 21st  century unless they are better protected, an environmental group warned  Tuesday.
"Under Fire," a survey by the London-based Environmental Investigation  Agency (EIA), says human-induced factors spell doom for the earth's whales,  dolphins and porpoises.
They are being scorched by ultra-violet radiation burning through the  widening hole in Earth's ozone layer.
The are being poisoned by toxic wastes dumped in the oceans.
They are starving as global warming plays havoc with delicate aquatic  eco-systems and over-fishing decimates their food supply. They are drowning in  fish nets and are being systematically slaughtered in direct kills, said EIA.
Despite growing pressure to protect the cetaceans, said EIA, "Japan and  Norway have orchestrated a powerful international lobby calling for the  resumption of commercial whaling.
"These countries," it said, "aim to force the International Whaling  Commission to agree to a new management plan for whales -- the Revised  Management Procedure, which if agreed will almost certainly result in the  slaughter of thousands of whales."
The report called the procedure "wholly unacceptable as it is specifically  designed to facilitate the resumption of commercial whaling," it said.
"Moreover, it totally fails to take into account the impact of  environmental degradation which, if unchecked, will lead to the extinction of  all cetacean populations."
It said Japan "continues to kill thousands of protected whales, thousands  more highly endangered dolphins and porpoises and has established and funded  numerous illegal 'pirate whaling' operations world-wide," said the EIA.
"Norway has also continued to whale in defiance of IWC resolutions."
