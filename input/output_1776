Russia is to start destroying its chemical  weapons-producing factories, First Deputy Premier Oleg Soskovets said  Wednesday, but a leading chemist said the move would make no difference to the  country's modernised stockpiles.
Soskovets announced the decision on a visit to a chemicals factory in the  Volga region of central Russia, ITAR-TASS said. He said he had agreed with the  president of the Russian autonomous republic of Chuvash, Nikolai Fyodorov, to  come up with a programme by September aimed at the gradual close of the plants.
But chemist Vil Mirzayanov, who last month escaped prosecution for  "revealing state secrets" by accusing Russia of continuing to manufacture  chemical arms in violation of international agreements signed by the former  Soviet Union, told AFP the programme would only affect chemical weapons which  were already obsolete.
"Production of these weapons ceased anyway three or four years ago," he  said. "But the production of new binary arms does not require special  facilities," Mirzayanov added.
He explained the new weapons "can be produced in any factory," even an  agricultural plant, without those in charge of the enterprise even being  necessarily aware of it. Two possible such sites were Ufa near Moscow and   Khabarovsk, in far eastern Russia, the chemist said.
The Soviet Union signed international agreements before its 1991  dissolution saying it would not produce any more chemical weapons, while  Russia is due later this year to sign the Paris Convention on destroying such  arms.
