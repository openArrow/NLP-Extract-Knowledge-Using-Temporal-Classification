China is to lay a 4,000-kilometre (2,480-mile)  fibre-optic cable to ease the burden on the overtaxed telephone network in the  booming southeast, the China Daily Business Weekly said Sunday.
The 1.4 billion yuan (161 million dollar) cable, the longest in China,  will link Hangzhou in Zhejiang province with Fuzhou in Fujian and Nanchang in  Jiangxi, the report said.
The project, to begin in October and be completed by late 1995, is to be  funded in part by World Bank loans for imported sophisticated equipment,  Zhejiang telecommunications official Zhang Bichun was quoted as saying.
Zhang said the exact size of the loan had not been decided and gave no  details of other forms of financing.
