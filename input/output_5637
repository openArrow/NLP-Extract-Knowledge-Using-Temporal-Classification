Units of the Russian Pacific fleet based on the  Kamchtka peninsula in far east Russia have begun mining the area surrounding  their munitions depots, ITAR-TASS news agency reported Tuesday.
The agency, quoting the fleet's information service, said the move had  been taken to combat an increasing number of attempted thefts of weapons. It  said warning notices would be put up in the mined areas.
On May 14 one of the fleet's bomb depots 100 kilometres (60 miles) from  Vladivostok was destroyed by an explosion. Two soldiers were arrested on  suspicion of having caused the blast while handling a detonator.
