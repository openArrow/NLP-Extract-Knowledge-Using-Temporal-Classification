German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Chistian Democratic  Union and its Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union regained the  lead in opinion polls Sunday after trailing the opposition Social Democrats  (SPD) for several months.
Media reports quoted the Forsa, Wickert, Emnid and Basis Research polling  institutes as giving the CDU/CSU a lead of between one and three percent ahead  of Rudolf Scharping's SPD, although Scharping remained the more popular  candidate for chancellor.
Germany faces a general election on October 16.
According to Forsa, last Monday's election of Christian Democrat Roman  Herzog as president gave a boost to the ruling coalition, which includes the  liberal Free Democratic Party.
Both CDU and CSU members of the electoral college which voted for Herzog  gave him their solid support in a calculated demonstration of unity, although  some FDP members did not back him.
The FDP itself is also regaining ground after earlier forecasts showed it  might struggle to garner the five percent of the vote necessary to enter  parliament. The latest Wickert poll gives the junior coalition partner 7.7  percent.
The Greens are forecast to take about eight percent, while of the other  fringe parties, the former communist Party of Democratic Socialism and the  extreme-right Republicans look to have no chance of clearing the five percent  hurdle.
A swathe of commentators meanwhile asserted that government claims that  economic recovery is around the corner are starting to gain public credence.  Chancellor Kohl has in recent weeks taken advantage of encouraging economic  data to make the theme the centrepiece of his manifesto as he goes for a  fourth election win.
But unions still lambast him for the level of unemployment, hovering  around 8.4 percent in the west and still stuck above 16 percent in the east.
