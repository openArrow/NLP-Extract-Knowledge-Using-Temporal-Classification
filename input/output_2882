At least four people were killed and 88 wounded in   two-days of shootings to celebrate the Moslem festival of Eid Al-Adha,  hospital reports said here Sunday.
The warring factions' leaders had agreed on a four-day ceasefire to give  their people a chance to take a breath during the Eid festival.
Different kinds of weapons, including anti-tank Russian-made RPG-7  rockets, were used in all parts of the capital by all factions and neutral  civilians to celebrate Eid.
"Our war is a war and our feast is a war as well. Bullets are the only  means available for the Afghans to show their sorrow, anger, disagreement,  misfortune and happiness," said Doctor Fatima in Karti-sa hospital.
