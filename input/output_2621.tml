<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><TimeML><TIMEX3 tid="t0" functionInDocument="CREATION_TIME"/>Johannes Rau is the candidate the man and woman in  the street would <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="would">vote</EVENT> for if they could, <EVENT eid="e2" class="REPORTING" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="could">according</EVENT> to the opinion polls.&#13;
Prime minister of Germany's most important and densely-populated state of  North Rhine-Westphalia since <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE">1978</TIMEX3>, the avuncular Rau, aged 63, is popular in  the land at large as well as being well-liked within his Social Democrat Party  (SPD).&#13;
Rau <EVENT eid="e3" class="REPORTING" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">says</EVENT> he would "reconcile rather than divide". But the present balance  of party votes in the presidential electoral system is against him, so he is  unlikely to have the chance to <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">demonstrate</EVENT> such a capacity.&#13;
A veteran of the SPD, which he <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">joined</EVENT> in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE">1957</TIMEX3>, he is one of its most  senior figures. At the last party congress, he <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">won</EVENT> more votes than any other  to the party praesidum, of which he has been a member since <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE">1968</TIMEX3>.&#13;
Rau unsuccessfully <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">led</EVENT> the party in the <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE">1987</TIMEX3> federal legislative elections  as its candidate for chancellor.&#13;
Born <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE">January 16 1931</TIMEX3> in Wuppertal, he is the son of a protestant pastor  and has <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">earned</EVENT> the nickname of "Brother Johannes" for his knowledge of the  Bible and his inspired language.&#13;
Rau is also an acknowledged mediator of political and partisan strife.&#13;
To be <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">elected</EVENT> Germany's head of state, with its moral rather than  political weight, would <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="would">represent</EVENT> a crowning achievement in the career of  someone who has always <EVENT eid="e11" class="I_ACTION" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">sought</EVENT> to be "a man of the people".&#13;
