Durable goods orders rose a tiny 0.1 percent  for April, against a revised 0.7 percent increase in March, the Commerce  Department said Wednesday.
While the gain was the eighth in nine months, it was considerably smaller  than the one percent rise that analysts had expected and could point toward  slower growth for the US economy in the second quarter.
The increase for April was the smallest since a 1.8 percent drop in  February blamed on an unusually cold and icy month.
Factory orders for durable goods -- products such as refrigerators and  computers expected to last more than three years -- are considered a key  barometer of economic strength.
The most volatile sectors of the index -- defense and transport spending  -- were both down. Transport orders dropped 1.6 percent, with orders for  aircraft rising and for railroad equipment and cars and strucks falling.  Pentagon orders slipped 0.7 percent for the month.
Electrical and electronic equipment led the rise at 8.6 percent, but  metals dropped 6.6 percent following a six percent gain in March.
Unfilled orders were up 0.1 percent, signalling that manufacturers may  soon expand production by hiring workers or expanding facilities.
Factory orders for April totalled a seasonally adjusted 147 billion  dollars, up from 146.9 billion in March.
