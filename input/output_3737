Clashes between the army and suspected leftist rebels  in Peru's jungle northeast have claimed the lives of 17 people since Friday,  the army said Tuesday.
Sixteen of those killed between Friday and Monday in Leoncio Prado and  Tocache provinces were suspected Maoist Shining Path guerrillas, the army  said. One soldier was killed and one civilian was still missing Tuesday, it  added.
Army troops seized hand grenades, AKM rifles, pistols and other weapons as  well as communications equipment and medicine in an anti-subversive raid in  Puerto Maria, Monzon, on Monday.
The army launched a major offensive in the northeast in April to crack  down on alleged subversives and drug traffickers active in the largely  isolated area.
President Alberto Fujimori has pledged to wipe out the Shining Path before  his term ends in 1995.
