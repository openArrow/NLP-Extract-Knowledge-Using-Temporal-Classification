Three million children in the Philippines are  malnourished, and many others are victims of physical and sexual abuse,  President Fidel Ramos said Wednesday.
He told an annual convention of pediatricians here that "largely because  of poverty and ignorance, millions of Filipino children continue to suffer  hunger, disease, and various forms of abuse."
"Government, as the head of the national family, has placed a very high  priority on securing and improving the welfare of the Filipino child," he  added.
According to Ramos, 150 million of the 190 million malnourished children  in the world come from Asia. Of these, three million are Filipino children,  most of them younger than six years old.
"Seven out of ten Filipino children come from large families where the  parents are jobless or unemployed," while one out of 20 Filipino babies die  during its first year because of poor health or lack of access to health  services, he said.
He also added nearly five million Filipino children for the past two  decades have been exposed to armed conflict.
"Many are abused -- physically, sexually, economically, and it is no  secret -- indeed, it is a cause for national shame -- that the Philippines has  come to be known abroad as a center for child prostitution," he added.
"Our children must grow into, and within, an economy strong enough to  withstand the global business climate of the 21st century. For this our  children must be imbued with the values of excellence, competitiveness,  industry and perseverance," Ramos said.
