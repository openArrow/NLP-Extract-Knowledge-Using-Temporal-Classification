Northern forces denied having fired a missile at the  southern bastion of Aden, where four people were reported killed and nine  others wounded Sunday.
"Our forces did not fire any missile at Aden," a northern military  spokesman told the official news agency Saba. The north has "since the war  started avoided targetting civilians and economic facilities."
Southern security sources earlier charged that the casualties, all from  the same family, were caused by a northern missile that exploded near the  offices of the UN Relief and Works Agency for refugees in the southern port  city.
The northern spokesman accused southern forces loyal to Ali Salem al-Baid  of "being behind the explosions in Aden to turn the population against the  legal forces and deceive international public opinion."
He also dismissed as "baseless" the southern allegations that Iraqi pilots  were fighting with President Ali Abdallah Saleh's forces.
Baid on Saturday proclaimed an independant Yemeni Democratic Republic in  south Yemen, with Aden as its capital.
On Sunday he was named president of the breakaway state, four years  exactly after the south and north united.
