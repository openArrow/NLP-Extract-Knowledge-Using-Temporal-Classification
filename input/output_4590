The Bundesbank intends to mark time in its  process of reducing key interest rates but this does not apply to the  repurchase rate, the president of the Bundesbank Hans Tietmeyer said on Friday.
In an interview with Bavarian BR2 radio, he said that the bank did not  expect to cut its rates for the time being.
"I was referring to the discount rate and Lombard rate," Tietmeyer said in  what was seen as a reference to remarks he had made at the beginning of the  week implying that the bank would pause in its policy of easing rates.
The discount and Lombard rates are the two main, or key, interest rates.
"It is clear that money market rates vary freely within the margin of  fluctuation between these rates and that is also the case for the repurchase  rate," he said.
The weekly repurchase rate is seen unofficially as the third key rate and  today accounts for two thirds of banks' refinancing requirements.
The lowest repurchase rate arranged on Wednesday was 5.20 percent which  was three basis points less than the lowest rate the week before. Under the  last six repurchase arrangements the repurchase rate had been cut by 6-12  basis points.
The Bundesbank reduced its key rates by half a point on May 11, setting  the discount rate at 4.50 percent and the Lombard rate at six percent.
Tietmeyer then made several statements which were interpreted to mean that  the bank wanted to pause in its process of reducing rates.
This, together with concern about interest rates elsewhere, and  particularly in the United States, had been given by dealers on financial  markets as a reason for turbulence in bond trading and a decline of share  prices.
