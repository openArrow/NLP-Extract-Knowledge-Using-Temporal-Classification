German Chancellor Helmut Kohl does not want to  succeed Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission, when Delors  retires at the end of the year, German government spokesman Dieter Vogel said  Friday.
Kohl "takes this view once and for all," Vogel insisted.
The choice of Delors' successor was to be made by the heads of government  of the 12 European Union countries at a summit on the Greek island of Corfu on  June 24 and 25.
The new president takes over in January 1995.
However, European diplomatic souces said Friday that a delay was being  considered, putting the choice back until after German legislative elections  on October 16 in order to facilitate Kohl's candidacy for the job, should he  lose the German chancellorship.
The latest opinion polls show the opposition Social-Democrats as likely to  win the autumn polls in Germany, defeating Kohl's Christian Union alliance.
The names most frequently given as possible successors to Delors are  Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, outgoing Dutch Prime Minister Ruud  Lubbers and the British EU Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan.
The German government spokesman on Friday refused to comment on reports of  a possible delay in the decision until after the German elections.
