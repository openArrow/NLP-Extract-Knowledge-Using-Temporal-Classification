Ruud Gullit may have walked out on  Holland's World Cup squad because he could not get on with the Ajax players,  his father said Tuesday.
It was at first assumed Holland's best-known player had had a row with  coach Dick Advocaat over tactics.
But the player's father, who admitted there was a disagreement about how  the team should play, told a radio station the fact there were seven Ajax  Amsterdam players may have triggered off the sudden exit.
Advocaat refused to believe tactics could be the cause as they had not  really gone into detail about how they would play.
Ronald Koeman, the Barcelona defender, said he had asked Gullit if there  was a rift in the team.
"I told him we wanted him with us and asked if a solution couldn't be  worked out but he didn't want to say anything," Koeman said.
Johnny Bosman, who plays for Belgian champions Anderlecht, and Arnhem  striker Hans Gillhaus were the two forwards best placed to replace Gullit.
However, Advocaat will not name a replacement until after Wednesday's  friendly with Hungary at Eindhoven.
