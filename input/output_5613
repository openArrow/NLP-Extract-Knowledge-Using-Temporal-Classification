British ambassador to China Sir Robin McLaren  said Tuesday that negotiations with Beijing on financing Hong Kong's  multi-billion dollar new airport could be resolved soon.
McLaren, who arrived here Tuesday for a short visit in which he is  expected to meet Governor Chris Patten and other government officials, told  reporters that he was optimistic talks with China on financing the 20.3  billion US dollar airport "will be resolved before I leave" in July.
Despite the lack of Sino-British cooperation on political developments in  Hong Kong during the transition to China's takeover in 1997, McLaren, said  other "things are carrying on in a fairly normal fashion."
Meanwhile, Lu Ping, director of China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs  Office, told a visiting delegation of the Hong Kong general Chamber of  Commerce in Beijing on Monday that he hoped an agreement on airport financing  could be reached soon.
Frank Cheng, one of the delegation members, told journalists that "in Lu  Ping's opinion, discussions on the airport financing plans could come to a  satisfactory conclusion within the next couple of months."
The British side favors raising debt on international capital markets, but  China fears the amount involved could leave the post-1997 administration with  a heavy financial burden.
Lu's remarks were being seen as a significant gesture by China to improve  the atmosphere in talks on economic issues, despite the political stalemate.
