The former Stalanist state of Albania welcomed a  bastion of Western culture Thursday when President Sali Berisha inaugurated  the country's first Coca Cola factory.
The plant, costing 9.5 million dollars and with a bottling capacity of  6,000 litres (1,300 gallons) an hour, marks the first successful large-scale  foreign investment in a country where, under the hardline post-war  dictatorship of Enver Hoxha, Coca Cola was banned as a "dangerous and  decadent" substance.
The government, which owns the land on which the factory will stand, has a  six percent stake in the venture.
Studies show that Albania is already the second largest per-capita  consumer of the famous drink in eastern Europe.
