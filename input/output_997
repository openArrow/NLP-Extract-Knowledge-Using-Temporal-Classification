The world's largest automaker General  Motors said Monday that its subsidiary Electronic Data Systems (EDS) and the  telecommunications company Sprint were considering a merger.
In a separate joint press statement, EDS and Sprint, the third largest US  telecommunications company, also confirmed that merger talks were underway.
"We have an opportunity to create a single source for products and  services to meet the converging information and communications needs of  customers," EDS Chairman Lester Alberthal and Sprint Chairman William Esrey  said in the statement.
EDS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of General Motors and the auto giant  would have to give up its ownership if the merger were to go ahead.
