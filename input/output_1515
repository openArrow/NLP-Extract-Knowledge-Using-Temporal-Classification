Investment commitments in priority areas in the  Philippines rose 54 percent on an annual basis to 61.02 billion pesos (2.26  billion dollars) in the first four months of 1994, the government's Board of  Investments said Wednesday.
Planned investments in the manufacturing sector accounted for 57 percent  of the total, followed by the public utilities sector with 19 percent, the  board said.
Investments in priority areas get various incentives such as tax holidays  and reduced duties of capital equipment.
Board spokesmen said 90 percent of the total were commitments to invest  and not yet actual investments.
