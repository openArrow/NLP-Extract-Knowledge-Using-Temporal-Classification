Ukraine has dismantled its 46 intercontinental  missiles, Interfax news agency quoted President Leonid Kravchuk as saying  Friday.
The scrapping of the SS-24 missiles was part of an agreement signed in  Moscow January by Kravchuk, US President Bill Clinton and his Russian  counterpart Boris Yeltsin.
The agreement called for the complete denuclearization of the former  Soviet republic where a total of 176 missiles, including the 46  intercontinental missiles with a range of more than 10,000 kilometers (6,200  miles) had been deployed.
The report came as Ukraine agreed to adhere to guidelines for  nonproliferation of missile technology, according to the White House in  Washington.
US Vice President Al Gore and Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valeri  Shmarov signed a memorandum of understanding on the Missile Technology Control  Regime (MTCR), to which the United States and 24 other nations belong, the  White House said in a statement Friday.
