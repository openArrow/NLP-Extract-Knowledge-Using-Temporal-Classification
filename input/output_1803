Wall Street closed up Wednesday after  recovering early losses thanks to an afternoon buying wave.
The Dow Jones blue-chip index closed at 3,732.89 climbing 12.28 points  (0.33 percent). Trading was steady with 337 million shares changing hands.
Gains outpaced losses by two and a half times at 1,633 against 664  respectively. Some 532 stocks remained unchanged.
Investors were encouraged by the trend, in spite of profit taking at the  beginning of the session, said analysts.
Analysts remain cautiously optimistic that gains will continue despite the  tightening monetary policy announced Tuesday by the Federal Reserve.
The bond market remained calm. The interest rate on 30-year Treasury bonds  hardly budged, going to 7.27 percent from 7.26 percent.
While most of the market posted gains, petroleum and auto makers lost.
Chevron led petroleum losses, due to a revision lowering estimated  second-quarter results. Chevron lost 1-3/4 going to 86-3/8. Atlantic Richfield  7/8 to hit 101-1/2.
Automobiles fell on the belief that a hike in short-term interest rates  would have a negative effect on sales. Ford lost 5/8 hitting 58-7/8 and GM 1/4  going to 54-1/8.
Banks posted gains with JP Morgan and NationsBank going up a dollar each  to close at 65-7/8 and 55-1/2 respectively.
