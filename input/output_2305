Naga militants killed six members of the rival  Kuki tribe in Assam and five people died in violence elsewhere in the remote  state in India's far northeast, the Press Trust of India (PTI) said Friday.
The news agency said that militants from the outlawed National Socialist  Council of Nagaland (NSCN) stormed a Kuki village in Assam's Chachar hills on  Thursday, setting it ablaze and killing six villagers.
Indian troops had rushed to the Kuki settlement following the attack, PTI  said, and a hunt was on for the assailants.
A leading member of the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) was shot  dead meanwhile in a gun battle with police in Assam's Lakhimpur district on  Thursday, police told PTI. A police officer also died in the shootout.
The slain ULFA militant was identified as Bhaiti Dutta, a district  commander.
Three other militants from ULFA, which is seeking independence for Assam,  were killed in a battle with the security forces in Assam's Nagaon district,  PTI said.
The NSCN has been waging a bush war for the past four decades for an  independent Naga tribal homeland to be carved out of the states of Nagaland  and neighboring Manipur.
A bitter feud between the Nagas and members of the Kuki tribe, who have  raised their own armed force, has left hundreds dead in the past two years.
