Thailand's biggest conglomerate, Siam Cement Co.,  announced Thursday its first quarter net profit had more than doubled over the  same period a year earlier.
Siam Cement and its subsidiaries posted a net profit of 1,437 million baht  (57.48 million dollars) for the three months to March compared with 694  million baht in the first quarter of last year, president Chumpol NaLamlieng  said.
"The increased net profit of 107 percent was attributed to a 21 percent  increase in sales revenues due to better market conditions," Chumpol said.
"Moreover, operating expenditures had decreased due to lower interest  rates and the group also profitted from foreign exchange rates."
Siam Cement itself had a net profit of 1,074 million baht during the  quarter, up from 598 million baht during the first three months of last year,  he said.
The news sent the company's stock up 74 baht on the Stock Exchange of  Thailand to a close of 1,054 baht.
