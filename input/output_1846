AC Milan supporters danced in the streets into the  early hours after their team won the European Cup for a fifth time on  Wednesday.
As soon as the final whistle drew the curtain down on Milan's superb 4-0  victory over Spanish champions Barcelona in Athens, hundreds of cheering  supporters, who had watched the match on television, took to the streets and  flocked to the city centre.
And roads became blocked as cars, decked-out in Milan's famous 'red and  black' colours and hooting their horns, came to a standstill.
