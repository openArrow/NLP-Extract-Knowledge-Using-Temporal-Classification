The principal players have refused to say whether the Japanese did bring  such an offer, but one US trade official said that the Japanese side had  brought detailed proposals which the US side considered worth exploring.
Commerce Secretary Ron Brown repeated Saturday that the any results of  Japan's market being opened must be measurable and monitorable.
"I think that the Japanese now finally understand that we are serious  about that," said Brown on CNN's Evans and Novak.
Since the February collapse of the talks, Washington has said it will not  return to the negotiating table until Japan comes up with proposals that would  give a good chance of success.
The talks came amid news of a worsening of the trade imbalance, with Japan  announcing Friday that its trade surplus with the United States expanded 8.9  percent in April to 4.4 billion dollars.
The US government's March trade figures showing a 25.4 percent boost in  the trade deficit with Japan to 5.80 billion dollars.
