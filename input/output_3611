Formula One was hit by a new shock as  Lotus driver Pedro Lamy was flown to hospital after a high-speed crash here on  Tuesday.
The Portuguese driver, testing a new car, lost control at 200kmh (124mph)  and smashed against a wall. He was flown to hospital with leg and arm injuries.
The 22-year-old's car was fitted with new safety features ordered by world  governing body FIA, designed to cut down power and reduce aerodynamics,  following the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at Imola and the  Monaco accident that left Austrian Karl Wendlinger in a coma.
