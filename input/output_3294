The Golden Palm, one of the world cinema's  most coveted prizes, was awarded Monday to "Pulp Fiction" by US filmmaker  Quentin Tarantino, Cannes Film Festival jury president Clint Eastwood said.
The award for best actor went to China's Ge You, for his performance in  Zhang Yimou's "To Live," while Italy's Virna Lisi was named best actress for  her part in the French movie "La Reine Margot" (Queen Margot).
The prizes were announced at a ceremony, hosted by veteran French actress  Jeanne Moreau, marking the climax of the 47th Cannes International Film  Festival, one of the world's biggest movie fests.
Tarantino's two-and-a-half-hour movie, starring John Travolta, Bruce  Willis and Harvey Keitel, caused a furore when it was presented only two days  before the end of the festival Saturday.
Parodying various genres, notably Bonnie and Clyde and gangster movies,  the film is based on a complex structure in three parts, with apparently  unrelated characters coming together in a final tour de force climax.
Tarantino, the 31-year-old director of the cult film "Reservoir Dogs,"  only recently finished work on "Pulp Fiction," and saw it in its finished  version with an audience for the first time only at Cannes.
Also awarded during the ceremony were Best Director to Italian filmmaker  Nanni Moretti for his semi-autobiographical "Caro Diario" (Dear Diary), while  the Grand Jury prize went jointly to "To Live" and Nikita Mikhalkov's "Burnt  by the Sun."
