A recent report by a commission covering security in the Commonwealth of  Independent States found the risk of fatal accident in the former Soviet Union  was 10 times higher than elsewhere.
The drop in safety standards has become more marked with the break-up of  former Soviet carrier Aeroflot into 150 smaller companies all fighting to make  ends meet.
Transport Minister Vitaly Yefimov minimized the falling safety standards  Tuesday but acknowledged the death rate per million passengers had gone up  from 3.5 to 5.5 between since 1992.
Whereas pilots used to belong to a relatively privileged profession,  their work conditions have recently deteriorated.
One striking pilot earning 600,000 rubles a month (320 dollars) explained  he was still working at 65 in order to avoid receiving a mere 100.000 rubles  (53 dollars) in retirement pay.
