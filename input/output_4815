A doctor upset over a business  deal pulled out a gun and killed two people, wounding a third, at the office  of a court reporting company, witnesses said.
A man and a pregnant woman were killed and another man was in critical  condition with a gunshot wound to the abdomen.
Police declined to identify the gunman, who was arrested at the scene.
"He fired six shots, two into each person," said Bret Tannenbaum, owner of  the court reporting service. "He ran out. I ran out after him. I knocked him  down and held him until the police arrived."
Tannenbaum said he believed the gun was empty after six shots were fired,  but police told him the 15-bullet cartridge had jammed.
Witnesses said the bearded man who walked with a cane was arrested and led  into a police car.
Tannenbaum said the man was a doctor agitated over a business deal and was  attending a conference to take statements for legal purposes.
"Yesterday, when he was here, he was really upset," Tannenbaum said.  "During Fridya's deposition, he decided 15 minutes into the deposition that he  would pull out a gun."
