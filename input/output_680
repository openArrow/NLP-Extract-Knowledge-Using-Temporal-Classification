Several people were reported killed when Khmer  Rouge guerrillas attacked a bridge and an administrative building in Mongkol  Borey, northwest Cambodia, a western aid official said here Sunday.
A number of people were admitted to hospital following the attack on  Saturday. The number of deaths and casualties could not be confirmed by the  official, in contact with Mongkol Borey by radio.
A Cambodian government officer across the Thai border in Aranyaprathet,  said 50 guerrillas blew up a section of a bridge on a road connecting Mongkol  Borey to the strategic town of Sisophon, eight kilometers (five miles) to the  east.
The bridge on National Route 5, part of the government's supply route, had  been made impassable for larger vehicles, according to the officer with the  Cambodian Thai Coordination Office.
Government troops managed to drive off the guerrillas from the structure  and reinforcements had been sent in, he said.
