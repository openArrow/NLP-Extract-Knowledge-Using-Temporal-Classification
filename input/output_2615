An Argentine military patrol boat fired  cannon shot and machine guns Friday at a Taiwanese fishing boat allegedly  operating illegally in Argentina's waters, officials said.
The incident occurred when the navy corvette Spiro detected the Hin Van  Sing off Argentina's South Atlantic port of San Julian some 2,300 kilometers  (1,500 miles) south of Buenos Aires, not far from the Falklands Islands.
The Taiwanese vessel refused to respond to warnings from the patrol ship  and then abruptly turned toward the Argentine ship, said military officials.  The warship responded with cannon and machine gun fire.
A statement from the armed forces said the warship continued pursuit of  the fishing boat after nightfall, but did not say whether there were any  casualties.
The Taiwanese vessel was painted red and white as required for foreign  ships fishing in Argentine waters, but had an improper identification number,  a technique often used by illegal fishing boats, officials said.
