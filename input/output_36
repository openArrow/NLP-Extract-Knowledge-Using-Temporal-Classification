Gunmen burst into a house in north Belfast  Thursday and killed a man at close range, police said.
The outlawed loyalist organisation the Ulster Freedom Fighters said they  carried out the attack in a call to a local radio station.
According to a spokesman for Sinn Fein, the political wing of the outlawed  Irish Republican Army fighting British rule in Northern Ireland, the victim  was a Catholic aged around 20 but not a Sinn Fein member.
The killing brought to 24 the number of people killed in sectarian  violence in Northern Ireland since the start of the year.
