Birdies at 16 and 17 lifted Elaine  Crosby to victory in the Lady Keystone Open golf tournament, one shot in front  of newly-crowned LPGA Champion Laura Davies of England.
Crosby claimed the second victory over her 11-year career with a two-under  70 for a five-under total of 211.
Davies, who was gunning for her third LPGA Tour victory in a row after the  Sara Lee Classic and last week's LPGA Championship in Wilmington, Delaware,  fell prey to an erratic round.
But her runner's up cheque for 37,237 dollars made her the first player on  the LPGA Tour to surpass the 500,000-dollar mark in winnings this season.
Betsy King, who is seeking a 30th career title that would automatically  put her in the LPGA Hall of Fame, was tied for third with Val Skinner on 213.  King carded a closing 73 and Skinner a level-par 72.
