France reserves the right to resume nuclear testing,  Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said on Tuesday, opening a debate in  parliament on the country's military programme from 1995 until 2000.
Balladur said France was "not committed by any international constraint"  on nuclear testing," alluding to a dispute between his right-wing government  and socialist President Francois Mitterrand, who opposes a resumption of tests.
"I can assure you that this freedom of choice (to resume testing) will be  preserved," Balladur said.
France has observed a moratorium on nuclear testing since April 1992,  along with the United States, Russia and Britain. China carried out a nuclear  test on October 5 last year.
Mitterrand, who under the constitution has sole power to decide on  testing, said recently his successor would in any case be unable to order a  resumption because his hands would be tied by the 1995 renewal of the nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty, to be followed by a nuclear test ban treaty.
Mitterrand will step down in May 1995 and his successor is expected to be  a conservative.
Balladur told parliament that the military planning bill, which calls for  an increase in spending of 0.5 percent, urged "a major unprecedented effort"  to simulate and miniaturise the nuclear weapons of the future which would  guarantee "the credibility of our nuclear arsenal."
The Gaullist component of the ruling right-wing coalition, the Rally for  the Republic (RPR), has campaigned for a resumption of testing, but RPR  parliamentary leader Bernard Pons said Tuesday his government would vote for  the bill.
Nuclear test campaigner Jacques Baumel, vice-chairman of the National  Assembly's defence committee, would agree to withdraw an amendment calling for  a resumption of tests in 1995 to acquire simulation capacity, Pons said.
He said an overwhelming majority of RPR MPs favoured a resumption of  testing to develop a system of simulation, but that it would be up to the next  president to decide.
Defence Minister Francois Leotard told parliament Tuesday that in 2000,  France would have the second biggest defense budget in the west, after the  United States, and "the biggest force on the European continent."
He said there would be nearly 580,000 soldiers and civilians serving in the  armed forces.
