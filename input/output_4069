Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali  lamented the failure of the United Nations and the international community to  prevent what he called genocidal slaughter in Rwanda, here on Wednesday.
"Unfortunately, with great humility, I failed. It is a scandal," he told a  news conference at UN headquarters.
"Let's recognize that it is a failure not only for the UN but also for the  international community. All of us are responsible for this failure," he said.
He blamed "the great powers, the African powers, the NGOs  (non-governmental organizations), all the international community. It is a  genocide."
He said he still hoped that 5,500 UN troops would be able to land in the  war-ravaged African country.
More than 200,000 people have been killed in nearly two months of ethnic  warfare and massacres in Rwanda. Boutros-Ghali decried the fact that after so  much time and spilled blood "the international society is still discussing  what ought to be done."
Boutros-Ghali said Ethiopia, Ghana and Senegal had agreed to contribute a  total of 2,000 troops to the UN mission in Rwanda. He added he had been in  contact with Egypt, Nigeria and Zimbabwe, although there are problems in  finding transportation equipment.
"Unless we have the support of the member states, we will not be able to  obtain the troops which we need on the ground," he said.
Boutros-Ghali recommended deploying UN troops both inside the Rwandan  capital of Kigali and on the borders to protect the thousands of refugees.
He said UN members were tired of financing and participating in so many UN  missions at once, which have grown from about three being run at one time to  the current 17.
