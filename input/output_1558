Rwandan rebels have turned their attention away  from the capital Kigali and are advancing towards a town to the southwest  where the government fled last month, United Nations officials said Wednesday.
Sporadic mortar blasts and small arms fire rocked the blood-sodden capital  Wednesday as guerrillas of the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) fought  government soldiers.
But it was "relatively quiet" compared to recent fierce artillery battles,  said Abdul Kabia, executive director of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda  (UNAMIR).
"Taking Kigali is not for the time being the RPF's number one objective,"  Kabia told AFP by telephone from Kigali.
Heavy fighting raged in the northwestern town of Ruhengeri where the army  is holding out against a rebel onslaught, and south of Kigali where the RPF  have cut off the government from the capital.
The rebels have seized control of a stretch of road between Kigali and  Gitarama, 40 kilometres (25 miles) to the southwest, where the interim  government fled as ethnic killings and fighting between government and rebel  forces engulfed the capital, Kabia said.
His report, however, was denied by an army spokesman who said government  forces controlled the road between Gitarama and Kigali.
The interim government was proclaimed after the death of president Juvenal  Habyarimana when his plane was allegedly shot down on April 6.
The rebel movement, dominated by the minority Tutsi tribe, considers the  Hutu-led government illegitimate and has branded it "a clique of killers."
The RPF has refused to negotiate with the government, which it blames for  the bloodbath unleashed by Habyarimana's death in which more than 200,000  Rwandans, mainly Tutsis and Hutu opposition supporters, have been butchered.
The rebels have sealed off the capital on three sides. They are trying to  sever army supply lines and isolate the government from its forces and  possibly force them to flee a second time, UN military sources said.
