Former US Open champion Scott Simpson  played 36 holes in nine-under-par 131 here Friday for the early lead in the  unfinished second round of the Colonial golf tournament.
But the American doubted he would remain atop the leaderboard when the  second round was completed Saturday morning.
"Nine-under is pretty good, but I'm not sure that's going to be leading,"  he said after shooting rounds of 66 and 65.
Nearly half the 110-strong field were to play the second round Saturday  morning thanks to storms on Thursday.
Hale Irwin, who birdied three of the four holes he played Friday for a  first-round 64, was one of them.
Irwin, 48, said he would not have minded carrying on with his second round  on Friday.
"Today was the day to keep playing," he said. "The ball had eyes. It was  the kind of putting feel you'd like to continue, but I only got four holes."
Zimbabwe's Nick Price and South African David Frost, who both completed  65s on Friday, still had their second rounds to come.
Simpson and 55 other players will take Saturday morning off after playing  36 holes Friday.
"I can't even remember the last time I played 36 in a day," Simpson said.  "Most of the guys are in good shape, though, so it wasn't a big problem."
Rookie Guy Boros shot a second-round 64 and was level in the clubhouse on  133 with Steve Pate and Mike Reid. Gary Hallberg followed after two  consecutive 67s for 134.
The double shift made it a tough comeback for Phil Mickelson, playing his  first tournament since he broke both his legs in a skiing accident in March.
Still limping, he carded two 68s.
