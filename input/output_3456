Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliyev said Tuesday that  negotiations with western oil companies for a production-sharing agreement  would continue but that national interests would be protected.
He said the "preservation of Azerbaijan's interests" would remain  paramount in developing the multi-billion dollar project.
Aliyev also moved to reassure members of the western consortium hoping to  develop two offhore oil fields with estimated recoverable oil reserves of 4.4  billion barrels.
"We are taking very important and responsible steps in preserving the  interests of Azerbaijan but the western (oil) companies will also benefit,"  Aliyev said at the opening of the International Caspian Oil and Gas Exhibition  and conference in the Azerbaijani capital Baku.
A senior consortium source said Aliyev's speech was "very encouraging."
The western oil consortium headed by British Petroleum/Statoil with 36.7  percent also comprises Amoco (24.3 percent), Pennzoil Co/Ramco Oil Services  (17 percent), Unocal Corp (16 percent), McDermott (three percent) and the  Turkish Petroleum Company (3 percent).
The western consortium has been negotiating the production sharing  agreement with Azerbaijani state oil company SOCAR for over three years - an  unusually long time in normal oil negotiating terms. The last round of  negotiations in Istanbul wound up last week without result.
Negotiations will resume next month.
