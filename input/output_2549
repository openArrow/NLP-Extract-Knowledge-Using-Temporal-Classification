The Italian lower house passed a vote of confidence  in Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's government Friday, clearing the last  parliamentary hurdle to the implementation of the premier's radical  free-market economic program.
Irena Pivetti, speaker of the lower house, announced Berlusconi's  conservative government had won 366 votes in the ballot, compared to 245  against.
The result of the vote was a formality following the formation of a  coalition of Berlusconi's Forza Italy, the federalist Northern League and the  neo-fascist National Alliance after the March 27-28 general elections.
A total of 611 deputies attended Friday's vote. No one abstained.  Berlusconi needed to secure at least 306 votes to secure the vote.
The senate, Italy's upper house, approved a confidence motion in  Berlusconi's administration by a tiny one-vote margin Wednesday.
Berlusconi appeared before deputies in the two-day debate at underwent a  last-minute grilling by the opposition about his plans for the recovery of  Italy's heavily indebted economy.
A confident Berlusconi, revelling in his Senate win, took pains to shake  hands Thursday with one of the key opposition figures, former lower house  speaker Giorgio Napolitano, seemingly unperturbed by critics' barbs that his  economic program was "vague and empty."
Following the vote Berlusconi new enters a critical 100-day trial period  during which he has pledged to launch an ambitious economic package to create  one million new jobs by the end of 1996 and cut government spending.
Investors have adopted a wait-and-see attitude, warning that the slim  Senate win showed that government projects could easily run into Senate  opposition and may need drawn-out negotiations to pass.
Berlusconi could get around this by resorting to government decrees to  impose economic changes in line with a policy adopted by previous government.
