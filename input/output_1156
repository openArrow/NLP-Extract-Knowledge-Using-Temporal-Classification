The UN Security Council approved the phased  deployment of 5,500 peacekeepers to Rwanda and slapped an arms embargo on the  violence-torn African nation.
The vote came early Tuesday after near-record nine hours of debates and  consultations among the 15-member council.
Rwanda voted against the clause calling for an arms-embargo, but it did  not prevent the resolution from being adopted.
In response to a US proposal, the UN peacekeepers will be deployed in  different phases which will be submitted to ongoing reviews.
Washington's insistence that the peacekeepers be sent in stages had  delayed the vote on the resolution since it was first circulated Friday and  drew harsh criticism from several countries.
The resolution calls on UN Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali to  immediately send to Rwanda several dozen UN military observers who had been  evacuated to Nairobi last month after the fighting broke out.
The size of the peacekeeping mission to Rwanda was drastically reduced  from 2,700 to some 300 after UN troops were killed in the fighting which broke  out five weeks ago.
