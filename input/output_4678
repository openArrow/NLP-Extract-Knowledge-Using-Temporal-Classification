Turkish authorities are studying a request by the  leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), Jalal Talabani, to cross  Turkey from Syria to reach northern Iraq, a foreign ministry spokesman said  Friday.
Ferhat Ataman said Talabani, currently in Damascus, and the leader of the  rival Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) Massud Barzani could come to Turkey "if  they agree to meet."
Clashes between the two factions in the Kurdish-controlled area of  northern Iraq have left at least 100 people dead since the beginning of the  month.
"I don't think such a meeting is possible in the near future given the  existing conditions ... Turkey is in contact with the two parties in a bid to  end the hostilities," Ataman said.
He also revealed that Turkish and UN officials had held talks in Geneva on  the fate of thousands of Turkish Kurds who fled a Turkish army crackdown on  the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in southeast Anatolia, crossing the border  mountains into northern Iraq.
"They should not be classified as refugees," Ataman said, refusing to  reveal details of the talks.
Aid organisations reported earlier in May that around 4,300 Turkish Kurds  had fled across the border since March, and the refugee wave was continuing at  the rate of 20 families a day.
The head of the UN Commissioner for Refugees in northern Iraq Francesco  Ardisson said they would be treated as refugees and supplied with food, water,  sanitation and medical care.
Ataman said the armed conflict had held up the distribution of Turkish  humanitarian aid in the areas of Suleymanieh and Arbil.
Northern Iraq has been under Kurdish control and jointly run by the PUK  and KDP since the zone was set up with the backing of the US-led coalition  that drove Iraqi occupying forces out of Kuwait in February 1991.
Thursday the two groups and the pro-Iranian Kurdistan Islamic League urged  Iran to mediate an end to the fighting which has split the area into PUK and  KDP zones.
