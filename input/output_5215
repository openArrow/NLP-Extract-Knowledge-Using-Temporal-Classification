If Graf spent only 40 minutes playing singles, she was able to enjoy a  full three-sets of mixed doubles.
She joined up with Frenchman Henri Leconte on a packed outside court but  lost to Americans Meredith McGrath and Scott Melville 2-6, 6-1, 8-10 in the  second-round.
In the men's doubles experienced Australians Todd Woodbridge and Mark  Woodforde put out 13th seeds Luke and Murphy Jensen of the United States in  the third-round.
What had promised to be a closely-fought encounter turned out to be a damp  squib. The Australians dropped only three games to reach the quarter-finals.
