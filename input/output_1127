Hours before Malawi's first democratic elections  Tuesday, the veteran outgoing President Kamuzu Banda urged the country's 3.8  million registered voters not to be intimidated.
Speaking in a slow voice on state radio late Monday, he said: "I just  heard there has been some shooting in Nsanje."
He did not elaborate, but charged that "certain people were intimidating  others so that they are scared to go and vote".
"Everyone should be left to vote freely," he said, without naming the   supposed intimidators in the three-way presidential contest and general  elections.
He said both the police and army would ensure that there is no security  breakdown.
Banda, who has been preaching tolerance and unity during his election  campaign, called on all Malawians who registered to go and cast their vote.
"Voting in an election is not acquired privilege, it is essential human  right," he said.
He said Tuesday's poll was important because it will determine how Malawi  will be governed in the next five years.
Regardless of the outcome, Malawians should strive for a better country,  he said.
"Both losers and winners in the end must remember that all Malawians must  work together.
"We should emerge from the elections as all winners," he said, urging that  they prove to the world that "we are politically mature and we can behave like  ladies and gentlemen".
He also thanked the multi-party National Consultative Council for guiding  Malawi through a transitional period.
"You did a good job," he said.
