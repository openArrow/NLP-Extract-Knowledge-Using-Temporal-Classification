MANILA, May 26 (AFP) - About 50 American criminals are hiding out in the  Philippines and will be the main targets of a Manila-Washington extradition  treaty that is in the works, the US embassy here said Thursday.
Mission spokesman Frank Jenista told AFP the fugitives' offenses covered  "the whole range" of felonies under US law. The list includes drug  traffickers, murderers and swindlers, he added. No names were provided.
He said the Philippine government also had "a number of high-profile  cases" in which the principal suspects have fled to the United States.
The two governments are now evaluating the latest draft of their proposed  extradition and mutual legal assistance treaties and once approved, these will  be put before their respective senates for ratification, Jenista said.
