Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat for California and a leading figure  in the vocal Congressional minority which favors sanctions, said in a  television interview Thursday that Clinton had not yet made his decision.
"I think that we do have an opportunity to get sanctions that members of  Congress can join the president and rally around, and that will be of  sufficient pressure to impress the Chinese," Pelosi said.
But she warned that if Clinton was not tough enough, she and Senate  majority leader George Mitchell would be introducing legislation to revoke  China's MFN on products made by the Chinese military and some other easily  identifiable categories of products.
Such legislation introduced by members of his own party would be  particularly embarrassing for Clinton, who made much during his election  campaign of incumbent George Bush's "coddling" of a Chinese government guilty  of widespread human rights abuse.
Last year Clinton outlined seven areas needing improvement before the June  3 deadline for deciding on whether to maintain China's MFN status for another  year, and asked Christopher to submit a report.
Administration officials said Secretary of State Warren Christopher had  written in his report to Clinton that China had met the minimum requirements  in two areas: cooperation in ending the export of prison-made goods and  allowing relatives of some dissidents to leave the country.
Although mixed results were reported in the other five areas, the  officials added, the progress described by the secretary of state provided  narrow legal grounds for MFN renewal.
In recent weeks China has moved to ensure renewal of its MFN status by  granting visas to would-be emigres and releasing some political prisoners.
It also invited Washington to send a mission to Beijing to discuss  complaints over China's jamming of broadcasts by the Voice of America.
