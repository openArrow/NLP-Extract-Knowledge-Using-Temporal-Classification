Queen Elizabeth has accepted President Boris  Yeltsin's invitation to make her first visit to Russia at a date "to be agreed  on jointly," according to a letter British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd  delivered to Yeltsin Tuesday, ITAR-TASS said.
Yeltsin had invited the Queen of England to visit Russia when he was in  London in November 1992.
British Prime Minister John Major had announced during his own visit to  Russia last February that the Queen planned to accept the invitation.
The British royal family had refrained from making any visits to Russia  under the communist regime, following the 1918 assassination by the Bolsheviks  of Czar Nicholas II and his family, who were allies and relatives of the  British royalty.
Hurd, who has been on official visit since Sunday, said Tuesday he was  "extremely satisfied" with his talks with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin,  the agency said.
Hurd also gave Chernomyrdin an invitation from Major to visit Britain  before the start of next year.
The British foreign secretary, who has met British businessmen working in  Russia, is to leave Moscow for the Ukrainian capital Kiev Tuesday for talks  there with his counterpart, Anatoly Zlenko, and Ukraine President Leonid  Kravchuk, before heading back to London.
Hurd had said Monday that he planned to question Ukraine leaders about the  crisis with their secessionist pro-Russian republic of Crimea and whether Kiev  planned to take up the issue at the United Nations.
