Two mortar rounds, allegedly fired  by Khmer Rouge troops, struck the Cambodian market town of Poipet Monday  night, killing one villager and injuring 13 others, a Thai military official  said.
Five of the injured were brought to Thailand for emergency medical  treatment, he said.
It was the second time the Khmer Rouge had shelled the bordertown in as  many days.
On Sunday, a sloppy mortar attack by Khmer Rouge forces pounded both sides  of the Thai-Cambodian frontier, injuring five Poipet villagers and prompting  Thai border units in Sakaew province to fire back.
At a border committee meeting here Monday, the Thai side asked for  compensation from the Phnom Penh government for injuries and damage sustained  as a result of stray shells and banditry in Thai territory.
Thailand has periodically protested the spillover from  government-guerrilla battles in Cambodia.
Thai military observers said Monday the Khmer Rouge appeared to be  softening up Poipet defences by creating chaos among civilians and trying to  trigger a mass evacuation.
After Sunday's shelling, some 500 Poipet villagers fled for Thailand,  where they were turned back by Thai border units.
