Vietnam and the United States have exchanged  agreements on the opening of liaison offices in their capitals in the first  step towards the establishment of diplomatic relations, a foreign ministry  statement said Thursday.
US Assistant Secretary State Winston Lord and Vice Foreign Minister Le Mai  exchanged letters agreeing to the opening of liaison offices in Hanoi and  Washington, the statement said.
The US pulled its last diplomats out of Vietnam in April 1975, when  communist forces took the southern city of Saigon from the US-backed  government.
