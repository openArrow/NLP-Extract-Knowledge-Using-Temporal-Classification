Andrea Montermini was slightly concussed  and broke bones in both feet when he crashed here Saturday in qualifying for  the Spanish formula one Grand Prix.
"He will stay in observation in the emergency ward for 24 to 48 hours," a  spokesman at the General de San Cugat hospital said.
Montermini broke a toe on his right foot and a bone in his left foot which  may need an operation.
The Italian, in his first Grand Prix meeting as a replacement for Roland  Ratzenberger who was killed at San Marino, lost control of his Simtek-Ford  coming out of a bend.
He ran off into a gravel trap and was jacknifed through a barrier of tyres  into a low wall.
Marshalls pulled him out of his wrecked car but first took him to the  track medical centre before flying him to hospital.
Montermini was contracted for the Spanish and Canadian races, with French  driver Jean-Marc Gounon, 31, taking over for the French Grand Prix. The crash  may have put an end to his F1 career before it even started.
