His first lap was 225.722 mph (361.115 km/h), but his next three laps were  the day's fastest, peaking at 229.481 mph (367.169 km/h).
"That's the sign of a great race car," Unser said. "When I saw 225, I knew  I needed to get after it more than that."
Roberto Guerrero's 1992 Indy qualifying record of 232.482 mph (371.971  k/hr) was never threatened.
Brazil's Raul Boesel qualified second at 227.618 mph (364.188 km/h),  putting aside the disappointment of penalties that cost him a victory here  last year.
"We've worked hard to come back," Boesel said. "I'm looking forward, not  behind. I thought we had a shot at the pole. The car was close to perfect. We  accomplished what we set out to do."
Villeneuve became the fastest Indy rookie ever, qualifying at 226.259 mph  ((362.014 km/h) to complete the provisional front row.
"It feels great," he said. "I was flat out from the beginning."
The second row so far includes former Formula One driver Michael Andretti,  St. James and reigning Indy series champion Mansell. The British racer's run  of 224.041 mph (358.465 km/h) came just before a three-hour rain delay.
"The car was running slower," Mansell said. "As the front came in, there  was more humidity in the air and it slowed us down a bit. The wind was  swirling and I had a hard time down the straights. I'm just happy we got the  run in and we can concentrate on the race."
St. James was celebrating a starting spot nine places better than any  woman at Indy.
"It feels geat to be where I'm at," she said. "From here, anything's  possible."
Penske racer Paul Tracy, injured in a practice crash Friday, was released  from Methodist Hospital but not cleared to drive Saturday, ending his pole  bid.
