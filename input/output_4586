It was just like the old days for Jim Courier at the  French Open on Friday as the American powered towards a probable quarter-final  showdown with Pete Sampras.
Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman was led like a lamb to the slaughter as Courier,  whose final defeat here last year kick-started the most serious slump of his  career, raced to a 6-3, 6-1, 6-1 victory in just 1hour 48min.
With a comfortable 4th round tie against the winner of the all French  clash between Fabrice Santoro and Olivier Delaitre coming up, Courier should  have no trouble keeping his date with the world number one.
It was a classic piece of grinding by Courier that took him past the  Swede. A 4th game break gave him a closely-fought first set 6-3 and he  immediately turned the screw with a break at the start of the third.
The finest of drop shots and a bullet return of serve set up a second  break to put Courier 4-1 ahead. Another fierce return brought him a third  break and the set.
By the second game of the third, the Swede's confidence was in tatters. He  splayed an overhead smash at the net wide and then made two unforced backhand  errors to gift Courier his break.
From there it was one-way traffic and Courier wrapped things up with a  powerful mid-court volley.
