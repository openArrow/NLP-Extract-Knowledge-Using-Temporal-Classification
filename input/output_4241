The United States and Vietnam have reached  agreement to open diplomatic offices in their capitals although no date has  been set, the State Department confirmed Thursday.
"The United States and Vietnam have reached agreement on the legal  framework for the opening of liaison offices in Hanoi and Washington," State  Department spokesman Michael McCurry said in a written statement.
"The date for opening the offices will depend on implementation of an  agreement to return each country's diplomatic properties," McCurry added.
Hanoi had announced the diplomatic breakthrough earlier, saying it was "an  important step in the normalisation of relations providing both governments  with favorable conditions to continue the resolution of issues of common  concern."
US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Winston  Lord and Vietnamese Vice Foreign Minister Le Mai exchanged letters on May 20  and 21 agreeing to the opening of liaison offices in Hanoi and Washington,  McCurry said.
The two sides have been negotiating to open the offices since February,  when President Bill Clinton lifted a sweeping trade ban imposed on all of  Vietnam after the communist victory over the US-backed southern government in  1975.
McCurry said that both sides wanted the offices to be opened soon.
