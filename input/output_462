India's central bank on Saturday kept interest  rates unchanged but cut commercial banks' lendable resources, in a bid to  fight double-digit inflation.
"It is a tight monetary policy," Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor  Chakravarthy Rangarajan told reporters here after announcing monetary and  credit policy for the first half of fiscal 1994-95, which began in April.
"The paramount objective would be to ensure a sharp reduction in the  inflation rate by about four percentage points over the present level," he  said. Inflation is currently hovering at around 11 percent.
Rangarajan said the cash-reserve ratio, the amount of money commercial  banks are statutarily required to keep in reserve, had been raised from 14 to  15 percent. The lending and deposit rates were unchanged at 14 and 10 percent.
The RBI chief said high foreign capital inflows had fuelled the current  inflationary spiral, the worst since the 1991 hike to 17 percent before New  Delhi launched its market reforms.
"The present credit policy has been drawn up against the background of a  very difficult situation when both inflation and money supply are up," he said.
