Three people were killed and set  alight after being accused of practising witchcraft in a remote village in  South Africa's Northern Transvaal province, police said Friday.
The three were killed late Wednesday by villagers in GaMogano, according  to police, quoted by the domestic SAPA news agency.
The deaths bring to 67 the number of people murdered this year after being  accused of being witches in this superstitious tribal area, the news agency  said.
African National Congress premier for the province, Ngoako Ramathlodi,  said "harsher penalties" would be imposed on people guilty of killing people  they believed were are witches.
