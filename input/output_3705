Greece Tuesday rejected European Union charges that  it violated EU law by slapping a trade embargo against Macedonia.
The foreign ministry said it had sent "observations" to Luxembourg, where  the EU is suing Greece at the European Court of Justice starting June 14,  saying the lawsuit is "unfounded".
The European Commission, the EU executive body, began legal proceedings  against Greece on April 13 in an effort to force Athens to lift the trade  embargo it imposed in February.
The union said those sanctions, stemming from a dispute over Macedonia's  name, hamper the functioning of the EU single market and impinge on free trade  between other countries and Macedonia.
Greece responded Tuesday that it was not breaking EU law and insisted that  the union had failed to prove allegations that the embargo hindered trade.
Greece maintains that by calling itself Macedonia, the former Yugoslav  republic implies that it has territorial designs on the northern Greek  province of the same name.
