South African Ernie Els scored a  psychological blow over his rivals as he edged in front at the PGA  championship here on Friday.
In January Els, 24, opened the Dubai Desert Classic with an astonishing 11  under par 61, and was never caught all week.
This time the lead is only one stroke, but his six under par 66 betrayed  sparkling form and included birdies at the last two holes.
He eclipsed Masters champion Jose-Maria Olazabal, who pitched in from 70  yards at the last for a five under par 67.
Alongside Olazabal, just one behind, is Italian Ryder Cup player  Costantino Rocca.
England's Mark James, Ireland's Ronan Rafferty, Scot Sandy Lyle and  Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez, who have done next to nothing this year, all  returned 68s and defending champion Bernhard Langer a 69.
"This round does not compare to Dubai, but I felt comfortable and calm out  there," said Els, who in his short career has already had top eight finishes  in the Open (twice), US Open and US Masters.
Ian Wosnam and Seve Ballesteros are already five adrift after rounds of  73, while Nick Faldo three-putted for the fourth time at the last hole to end  with a level par 72.
Most unlucky player of the day was another Ryder Cup star, Ireland's  Eamonn Darcy, who had to quit after only four holes because of a trapped nerve  in his back.
It is the third tournament in a row that the 41-year-old has had to  withdraw and he has still to earn a penny from seven events in 1994.
