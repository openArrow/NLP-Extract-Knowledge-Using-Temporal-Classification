The field includes nine first-time Indy starters and 18 drivers with only  one or two races here. In addition, Michael Andretti missed last year while  strugglig through a failed F1 bid. He has not raced here since low infield  areas were converted to grass to discourage passing.
"I don't like it," he said. "There is a whole lot of follow-the-leader  racing, not much side to side, not much passing. It's too unstable. Traffic  will be the main concern."
"Starting position is very important. Pit stops during yellow flags are  really critical. A couple of seconds in the pits can drop you from first to  10th and if you are pushed back in the pack, you can't pass to get up front  very fast," he said.
"Passing is a lot more difficult, but it's also a lot safer," said Italy's  Teo Fabi, who starts in row eight.
Dutch racer Arie Luyendyk, a third-row starter between Mansell and Mario,  expects pit crews will play a key role in deciding a winner.
"Pit stops will be critical," he said. "You can come in ahead and all of a  sudden have to pass five cars. It will be more of a factor than last year."
A total of 14 non-US racers will start Sunday, including four from Brazil,  three Canadians and two from Japan. Fittipaldi and Luyendyk are the only  non-US winners here since 1966, but they have combined to win three of the  past five Indy 500s.
