In Paris, the developer of RU-486, Etienne Baulieu, said he was  disappointed that the company he had worked for for 30 years had given away  the US rights -- but pleased the drug would soon be available to women in the  United States.
"Roussel Uclaf leaders are afraid of trouble," he said. "They are men, not  very young, who do not see the interest in this product for women and do not  believe it will mean much revenue."
