Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk returned to  Beijing Wednesday to resume medical treatment for a cancer that has spread to  his bone marrow.
Although smiling and waving, King Sihanouk was cleary weak and had to be  helped down the steps from the airplane after his flight landed at Beijing's  international airport.
Citing "serious health problems" Sihanouk said last week that he needed to  return to Beijing from Cambodia two weeks ahead of schedule.
The king spoke for several minutes with Chinese officials among the  welcoming committee before being whisked away by limousine.
Sihanouk, 71, began chemotherapy and radiation treatment at a Beijing  hospital in October folowing the discovery of a tumour near his prostate  gland.
He has maintained homes in Beijing and the North Korean capital Pyongyang  for several years.
