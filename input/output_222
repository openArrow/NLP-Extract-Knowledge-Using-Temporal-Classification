A Palestinian stabbed a Jewish settler on Friday  near Tapuah settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, military officials  said.
The army launched a manhunt after the Palestinian fled. The settler was  taken to hospital for treatment but he was not in danger.
Earlier Friday, Palestinian police took control of the West Bank town of  Jericho ending 27 years of Israeli occupation, under the May 4 deal to launch  Palestinian self-rule.
