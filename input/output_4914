Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk said Saturday peace  talks in Pyongyang had agreed on forming a standing committee to solve issues  between the government and the Khmer Rouge, a press report said.
In a speech at a banquet, hosted by North Korean President Kim Il-Sung,  Sihanouk thanked him for helping arrange the talks which began Friday in the  North Korean capital bringing together Cambodian leaders, the Korean Central  News Agency said.
King Sihanouk said the assistance had made it possible "for the leaders of  the state of Cambodia and the Democratic Cambodia side (Khmer Rouge) to  achieve positive results of unanimous support" to certain principles, the  official news agency said.
The king said the principles were "a ceasefire, though the date is yet to  be designated, defending the national and territorial unity of the country"  and forming a committe made up of all the groups to solve "one by one the  pending issues" between the government and Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
The peace talks, expected to last until Monday, brought together King  Sihanouk, co-Premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, parliament  chairman Chea Sim and Khmer Rouge nominal leader Khieu Samphan.
