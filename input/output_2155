England's young guns felled New  Zealand after the tourists had got themselves into a potential winning  position in the first one-day international here on Thursday.
After New Zealand had pegged back England's batsmen's opening flourish,  restricting them to 224 off their 55 overs, the tourists survived the early  loss of Martin Crowe and at 78-1 looked to be in the driving seat.
But then debut boys Darren Gough and Shaun Udal got into gear and put  England on the way to their 42 run victory.
Paceman Gough, who had taken master batsman Crowe's wicket with his sixth  delivery and only two runs on the board, added that of fellow opener Bryan  Young with a magnificent swinging yorker.
That success ended a patient innings of 65, and effectively finished New  Zealand's hopes.
By then Udal had spun out Adam Parore and, crucially, removed Kiwi skipper  Ken Rutherford lbw for a duck, with an intelligent quicker ball.
England captain Mike Atherton played his part with a polished 81 and Chris  Lewis batted like a genuine all-rounder.
However the day belonged to England's newcomers, who will surely keep  their places for the second of the two one-day internationals at Lord's on  Saturday.
Gough's first over ended spectacularly. Having already rattled Crowe with  his pace, he had him cutting unconvincingly at a ball that flashed into Alec  Stewart's right hand at slip.
England could even afford to drop three catches after that. Lewis ripped  through the middle and lower order, Graeme Hick nipped in with two wickets and  the Kiwis needed a stand of 30 between last pair Matthew Hart and a hobbling  Danny Morrison to drag an already dead contest into the 53rd over.
