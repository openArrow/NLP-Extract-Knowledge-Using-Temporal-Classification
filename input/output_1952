At least 1,000 Ukrainian interior ministry  forces and national guard members were dispatched to the Ukraine's pro-Russian  Crimea republic overnight, Crimean acting interior minister Valery Kuznetsov  told the local parliament here Thursday.
Kuznetsov said troops were headed by Ukrainian deputy interior minister  General Netrigailo who presented him with a decree from President Leonid  Kravchuk ordering local forces to bow to the Kiev government.
Sources in Kiev said the move amounted to the introduction of presidential  rule in the Crimea which has been moving towards closer ties with Russia.
Kuznetsov said the forces landed at the military airports of Khersones and  Belbek, near the Crimean city of Sebastopol and home base of the Black Sea  fleet.
The ITAR-TASS news agency quoted sources close to the Black Sea fleet as  confirming the arrival of the forces, said to number between 1,000 and 1,300.
The news agency also said that a delegation from the Ukrainian security  ministry had arrived in Sebastopol.
Crimean parliamentary speaker Sergei Tsekov called for vesting Kuznestov  with the full powers of interior minister at the parliamentary session to ward  off the threat of a takeover from Kiev.
