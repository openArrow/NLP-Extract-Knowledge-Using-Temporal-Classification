The leading presidential candidate for the  October elections in Brazil said Tuesday he would bar what he called foreign  speculation in the country's financial markets if elected.
Workers Party candidate Luis Inacio "Lula" da Silva said foreign capital  would be "welcome" if it were aimed at generating jobs, but maintained,  "Brazil does not want them (investors) if they are coming to speculate."
Da Silva, who is far ahead of his rivals in opinion polls with between 36  to 42 percent of the vote, said, "Open borders are nice in speeches, but in  practice every country has mechnisms to defend its own markets and products."
Figures from Brazil's central bank showed that some 19.7 billion dollars  in foriegn capital came into Brazilian stock and financial markets between  1990 and 1993.
