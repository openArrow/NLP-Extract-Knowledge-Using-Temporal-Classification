If any golfer has had a chequered career it is  Germany's Alexander Cejka, the leader after the first round of the Italian  Open on Thursday.
After escaping with his father from the old communist Czechoslovakia as a  nine year old, he turned professional at 18 having started in the game by  caddying for his father and grandfather in his birthplace, Marienbad.
When he joined the circuit last year he promptly broke a finger in a motor  cycle accident and contracted hepatitis.
This year the 23-year-old from Munich who is now a German citizen has been  busy showing that he can be a force on the European Tour.
Cejka shot an eight under par 64 at the Marco Simone course on Thursday  for a one stroke advantage over England's Paul Eales, the winner of the  Extremadura Open in February.
Australian Peter O'Malley and Northern Ireland's Ronan Rafferty shared  third place on 67.
Cejka, who had his long hair tied in a poiny tail for his first 18 months  as a pro, explained his dramatic flight from eastern Europe.
"My father was an engineer and he was fed up with communism," he said. "We  were allowed to go to Yugoslavia for a holiday but once we were there we just  put on our rucksacks, walked out of the hotel, hitch hiked on foot and by  train through Italy and Switzerland to get to Germany."
They settled in Frankfurt, but the collapse of the Berlin Wall has seen  his father return to Marienbad and Cejka will return there later this year  when the European Tour stages one of their Ryder Cup qualifying events there.
Cejka has had six top 20 finishes so far this year and his career best  outing opens up the prospect of a 75,000 pounds title.
Eales is chasing the cash in a bid to snatch one of the two places in next  month's US Open available to the top two players on the European money list  after next week's British PGA championship at Wentworth.
