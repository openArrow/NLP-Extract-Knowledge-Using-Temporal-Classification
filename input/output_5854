Serbs from the self-proclaimed republic of Krajina  in Croatia Tuesday blocked UN aid convoys destined for the north-west Bosnian  pocket of Bihac, the spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees,  Peter Kessler, said.
The Krajina Serbs have for the past two weeks held up convoys destined for  the south of the Bihac pocket, which is controlled by the mainly-Moslem  Bosnian government army.
On Tuesday they extended the ban to convoys going to Velika Kladusa,  headquarters of the maverick Moslem leader Fikret Abdic whose forces are  fighting the Bosnian army.
Until the latest move, convoys for Velika Kladusa could leave Krajina  without authorisation. "The Serbs now want us to provide authorisation for  every convoy, one week in advance, from Knin," the headquarters of the Krajina  Serbs, Kessler said.
An estimated 230,000 people living in Bihac, surrounded by Krajina and  Bosnian Serbs, depend on the UN delivering around 2,900 tonnes of food per  month.
