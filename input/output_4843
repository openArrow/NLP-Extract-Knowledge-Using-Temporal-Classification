Heavy shelling, reportedly by Bosnian Serbs, of  the northern Bosnian town of Gradacac killed one civilian and injured two on  Friday, United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Major Dacre  Holloway said.
Around 130 artillery shells and mortars rained down on the region,  including 10 to 15 on the town itself, he said.
Gradacac, 25 kilometres (15 miles) west of Brcko, is an outpost of the  mainly-Moslem Bosnian army at the western entrance to a Serb-controlled  corridor linking western Bosnia with Serbia.
In Belgrade, the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA reported that Bosnian army  units launched an artillery and infantry assault against Serb-held areas in  northeastern Bosnia on Friday.
More than 100 tank shells fell on the Serb village of Priboj, wounding two  civilians and seriously damaging houses, the agency said.
Bosnian forces also shelled the Stolice television relay station as ground  troops attempted to breach Serb lines but were rebuffed by Serb defenders,  SRNA added. The station changed hands twice last week.
Government gunners in addition shelled the Serb-controlled town of Doboj,  around 80 kilometres (50 miles) north of Sarajevo, forcing civilians into  shelters, the Belgrade-based Tanjug news agency said.
Bosnian army shelling there Thursday wounded eight civilians, five  seriously, according to the agency said.
