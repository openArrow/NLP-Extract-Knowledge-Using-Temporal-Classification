Four tourists were among six people killed  Wednesday when their sightseeing plane crashed in northwestern British  Columbia, city authorities said Friday.
Police identified three of the dead as Fleur Pichon of London, Christine  McCarthy of Rotorua, New Zealand and Louis Couvillion of Los Angeles.
The identity of the fourth tourist was being withheld until authorities  were able to notify relatives.
The single-engine Piper Cherokee reportedly slammed into the Johnson  Mountain, near the Alaska border, during a whiteout Wednesday. Bad weather  blocked attempts to find the bodies and wreckage until Friday.
