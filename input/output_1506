South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-Joo on  Wednesday held out hopes for a negotiated solution to the nuclear standoff  with North Korea despite news Pyongyang had started refuelling a nuclear  reactor.
Han, now on a trip to Bangkok, told accompanying journalists it was  "improper" for North Korea to start the refuelling process without the  presence of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
"However, if the IAEA judges that the situation is not so serious, the  US-North Korea high-level talks will take place," he was quoted by Yonhap news  agency as telling reporters.
"The high-level talks could be held early next month," Han added.
He said North Korea must allow the IAEA to select samples from the used  fuel rods at the five-megawatt reactor to measure their radioactivity at a  later date and help determine whether fissile material was diverted for  weapons.
These are the minimum conditions for the US-North Korea talks to be held,  he said.
The talks would focus on the diplomatic recognition of North Korea and  economic aids by Western countries and the halt to the 1994 US-South Korea  joint military exercise, Team Spirit, scheduled for November.
North Korea earlier said it had to start replacing the fuel rods, but it  was not clear how far they had progessed.
Han's remarks came after North Korea reportedly informed the United States  that it would agree to store and seal off the fuel rods under surveillance by  IAEA inspectors now in North Korea.
Pyongyang has also said it would allow the testing of the rods when it  reached a "package deal" on the nuclear issue with Washington.
