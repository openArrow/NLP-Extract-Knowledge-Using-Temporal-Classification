Former opposition Labour cabinet minister Bryan  Gould, Monday night officially resigned as an MP to return to his native New  Zealand to take up an academic post.
Gould, 55, had announced his intention to resign three months ago. He   unsuccessfully fought the Labour leader John Smith, who died last Thursday,  for the leadership in 1992.
He later resigned from the shadow cabinet, but remained active in  parliament, persistently criticising John Smith for what he called his  apparent failure to promulgate any Labour policy.
Gould's resignation creates a by-election in Dagenham, a car-making town  in Essex, east of London, where Gould held a majority of more than 6,500. The  poll is likely to take place on June 9, the same day as European elections.
