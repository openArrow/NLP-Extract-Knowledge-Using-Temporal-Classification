A Danish railway worker at Copenhagen's main  station survived an electric shock of 25,000 volts in a railway tunnel, the  national railway company DSB said on Tuesday.
The 20-year-old worker accidentally touched an overhead power line with an  iron bar on Sunday night. He fell on the track in shock, but after a period of  unconsciousness managed to call for help.
He was badly burned on the hands and feet and taken to hospital.
"It's a miracle he is still alive," a DSB spokesman said, adding that the  man was standing on a ladder connected to the earth, which saved his life.
