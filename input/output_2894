The Duchess of York is considering starring in a  film as Boudicca (also known as Boadicea), who defended Britain against the  Romans, the Sunday Times reported.
The script contains a scene in which Boudicca is flogged, naked, by Roman  soldiers, the weekly said.
It reported that the estranged wife of Prince Andrew had been invited to  incarnate the first century warrior queen by controversial director Ken  Russell.
The paper quoted her office as saying she had read the script, regarded it  as "very good" and that a decision on whether she would take the part would be  made this week. It added that the main problem was finding time in the  duchess's busy schedule. The projected film would take 10 weeks to shoot.
Boudicca united the northern tribes of England against the invading Romans  after her daughters were raped. After initial victories, she was defeated by  Caius Paulinius Suetonius in 61 A.D. and took poison to end her life.
The Sunday Times noted that Boudicca is often portrayed as a redhead, like  the duchess, who is 34, a year younger than Boudicca when she died.
Co-producer Ken Rowles told the paper "It is a very serious role, largely  factual in terms of what we know about Boudicca. I understand the duchess is  taking it seriously."
The Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, separated from Prince Andrew, Queen  Elizabeth's second son, in June 1992. They have two daughters, the princesses  Beatrice, aged seven, and Eugenie, four.
