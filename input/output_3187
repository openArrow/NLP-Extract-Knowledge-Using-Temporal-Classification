Colombian Vice President Juan Manuel Santos  Monday pleaded for deeper global commitment to combat drug trafficking, and  expressed his country's determination to wipe out dangerous drug cartels.
"We have defeated so-called narco-terrorism, but to defeat drug  trafficking, a deeper commitment and cooperation of all nations of the world  is required," Santos said in his address to leaders of the Pacific business  community gathered here for a three-day meeting.
Santos, whose country is known for its massive problems with drug  trafficking and guerrilla warfare, Monday commended Malaysia's tough anti-drug  laws under which traffickers could be sent to the gallows.
"I cannot over-emphasise the importance of adopting a strong commitment  against organised crime," Santos said, referring to the warning of death  penalty for drug traffickers he saw on his arrival in Malaysia.
A mandatory death sentence is imposed on anyone found in possession of 15  grammes (0.53 ounces) or more of heroin, 200 grammes (7.05 ounces) of cannabis  or a kilo (2.2 pounds) of opium, and who is deemed a drug trafficker under  Malaysia's anti-drug law.
Malaysia has hanged some 100 people, at least 30 of them foreigners, since  the mandatory death penalty for trafficking was introduced in 1981.
To underline how Columbia has suffered under the drug scourge, Santos  said: "We have lost our most promising politicians, our most honest judges,  our most courageous police officers, our best journalists."
The huge sacrifice, he said, had only strengthened Colombia's  determination to continue this war, adding: "We are winning."
"Proof of this is in the defeat of the most powerful and dangerous drug  cartel, the Medellin Cartel, whose members are all either dead or in jail,"  Santos said.
