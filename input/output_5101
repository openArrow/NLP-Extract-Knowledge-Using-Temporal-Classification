Michael Lynagh later admitted that Ireland had "exposed a hole" in the  Queensland defensive pattern with its ability to keep the ball alive and had  used the ball intelligently.
Irish aggression distinguished this team from the one hammered 55-18 by  New South Wales in Sydney.
"They were certainly very aggressive towards us and next week's test is  going to be no different, I would think," Lynagh said.
Second rower John Eales turned in a man of the match performance at blind  side flanker to prove he's over his shoulder injury, which sidelined him all  of last season, and worthy of selection somewhere in the back five.
Wallaby flanker David Wilson was outstanding in the loose and was close  behind Eales as Queensland's most damaging forward.
