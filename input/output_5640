Mitsubishi Corp. plans to issue some 200 billion yen  (1.92 billion dollars) next year in five-year straight bonds, the largest  single bond issue of this kind ever to hit the Japanese domestic market, a  company official said Tuesday.
Five-year straight bonds in Japan were first allowed in November last  year. So far Tokyo Electric Power Co.'s 150 billion yen (1.4 billion dollars)  bond has been the biggest one, according to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun.
Mitsubishi's issue would boost the domestic bonds market, the official  said.
"Thanks to the current record-low long-term interest rates, we can offer  the large-scale bonds, because it should not cost a lot to raise funds," the  official said.
Mitsubishi's bond issue price is 99.90 yen per 100 yen (0.96 dollars) and  the coupon rate is 3.45 percent per annum, according to the official.
The bonds can be only offered to institutional investors through a  syndicate of 16 brokerages and Japan's Nikko Securities Co. serving as the  lead manager.
Straight bonds are normal bonds, unlike warrant or convertible bonds or  others that carry specific conditions.
