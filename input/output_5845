The 115km stage was headed for a big group finish when a fall split the  leading pack. Bugno was among a leading group of 12 who were able to escape  thanks to the disruption and finally finished 10th.
Berzin headed the second group to come home six seconds back in 13th  place. The Russian leads overall by 2min 16sec.
