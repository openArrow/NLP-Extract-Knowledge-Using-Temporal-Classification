Northern forces fired a missile on the key  southern Yemeni city of Aden on Sunday killing four people and injuring nine,  all from the same family, rescue workers and hospitals said.
They updated an earlier casualty toll of two dead and three wounded, and  added that several of the injured were in serious condition when the missile  crashed into the airport district.
It exploded near the offices of the UN Relief and Works Agency for  refugees (UNRWA), where windows were smashed and service vehicles damaged. Its  nine foreign employees moved into a seafront hotel guarded by mountains.
The missile was either a Totska or Luna, both of which are Soviet-made and  part of the northern army's arsenal, according to Western diplomats in this  port city and capital of the newly-declared Yemeni Democratic Republic.
Both sides have fired missiles at each other's main cities since a civil  war erupted on May 5.
