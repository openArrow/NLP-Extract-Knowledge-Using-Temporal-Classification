Southern troops suffered "heavy losses" when  northern forces recaptured the town of Al Musaymir, northwest of Aden, a  spokesman for the defense ministry announced overnight Friday.
The report came as northern leaders rejected as "nothing new" a  seven-point ceasefire plan put forward by their southern counterparts.
Northern troops advanced in the town of Daleh, 90 kilometers (55 miles)  north of Aden, which controls one of the main routes to the former southern  capital, SABA news agency quoted him as saying.
Reports on the developments at Daleh were contradictory Friday, with each  camp claiming control of the area.
The spokesman said southern forces also suffered heavy losses at Abyane  where large amounts of weapons and ammunition, including 18 tanks and four  armored vehicles, were seized.
The rival armies of former North and South Yemen have been locked in civil  war since May 5, shattering four years of uneasy union between the  conservative north and the Marxist south.
Arab League delegates carrying a message from the organization's Secretary  General Esmat Abdel Meguid calling for an immediate halt to the civil war were  due to meet with President Ali Abdallah Saleh on Saturday.
Friday's peace plan, proposed by the southern Yemen Socialist Party (YSP),  called for an immediate end to the nine-day war and the creation of a national  unity government.
But northern leaders repeated demands made at the beginning of the  conflict for southern leaders to surrender.
