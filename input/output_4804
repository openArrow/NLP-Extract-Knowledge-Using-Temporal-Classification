Less than 24 hours after Bill Clinton  approved Most-Favored-Nation trading status for China, major American fast  food chain Kentucky Fried Chicken announced Friday it will invest 200 million  dollars China.
KFC, a subsidy of Pepsico, said renewing MFN played a major role in its  decision to make the investment over the next four years.
The chain has 28 restaurants in nine Chinese cities. Most of the  restaurants are joint-ventures, but KFC directly owns two. KFC plans to have  200 restaurants in 45 Chinese cities by 1998.
The restaurants could employ more than 20,000 Chinese and could have sales  topping 350 million dollars, said the company.
KFC presently employs 3,000 workers in China and has already made an  investment of 30 million dollars in the Chinese economy.
Worldwide KFC has 9,000 restaurants in 69 countries serving over 6.6  million people each day.
