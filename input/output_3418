An undersea earthquake measuring 6.2 on the Richter  scale struck Taiwan on Tuesday, but no damage or casualties were immediatedly  reported, the Central Weather Bureau said.
Following five major quakes measuring 4.6 to 5.8 on the Richter scale and  140-odd aftershocks Monday, the latest tremor struck at noon (0400 GMT)  Tuesday and lasted for some 90 seconds, the bureau said.
The quake shook high-rise buildings across the island.
Its epicenter was 103.8 kilometers (64.5 miles) east of Hualien in eastern  Taiwan, under the sea at a depth of 2.5 kilometers (1.55 miles), it said.
The island is situated on an earthquake belt. Most tremors are centered  under the surrounding sea, which cushions their destructive strength.
Earthquakes of magnitude 6.0 on the Richter scale are capable of causing  severe damage in a populated area, while one registering 7.0 is considered a  major quake capable of widespread, heavy damage.
