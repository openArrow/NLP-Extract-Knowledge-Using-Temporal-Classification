Bosnian Serb forces seized back control of a  cannon that was under UN supervision in the exclusion zone around Sarajevo "in  violation" of the NATO ultimatum, a UN military spokesman said Tuesday.
The 105-mm. artillery gun was at a site where heavy weapons had been  rounded up in Krivoglavci, in a Serb-controlled zone northwest of Sarajevo,  said Major Rob Annink, spokesman for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR).
The site was a designated "weapon collection point" within the 20  kilometer (12-miles) exclusion zone for heavy arms imposed by the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization around the capital, he said.
UNPROFOR "immediately" contacted the Bosnian Serb military headquarters in  Lukavica, a southwestern Sarajevo suburb, which said the cannon had been taken  Monday at "the initiative of a local commander," according to the major.
The Serb command said they would investigate the incident.
A UN forces patrol noticed the weapon was missing early Monday evening.
"It's a violation of the ultimatum" ordered by NATO to neutralize the  Sarajevo zone under threat of air strikes.
He also said that UNPROFOR was trying to consolidate the number of weapon  collection points to facilitate monitoring.
In another incident, Serb forces Tuesday were holding five people  including a UN employee they detained around midday Monday at a Serb  checkpoint at Kasindolska on the road to Sarajevo airport, the major said.
He said UNPROFOR was negotiating to try to obtain their release,  identifying the other four as a local employee of the UN High Commissioner for  Refugees (UNHCR), and three local people with "a press card."
The situation was unchanged in the rest of the country, with fighting  continuing in the Travnik region in western Bosnia where the mainly Moslem  Bosnian army was trying to take control of a strategic Serb-held hill  overlooking the city, the Vlasic plateau.
"We have reports of fierce artillery fighting in the area of Donji Vakuf  and Prusac," southest of Travnik, the spokesman said.
Annink said there were also reports of eight shots from Serb tanks in the  area of the strategic Brcko corridor against the village of Brka, a Bosnian  Moslem position to the south.
The Serbs are trying to gain control of the corridor, barely three  kilometers (1.5 miles) wide at its narrowest point, to link territories they  have won in Croatia and northwestern Bosnia with their conquests in eastern  Bosnia right up to Serbia.
Fighting was also reported in Mostar in the south.
On Monday, UNPROFOR said the UN-controlled Tuzla airport in the northeast  was shelled as Serb forces counter-attacked in northern Bosnia in a bid to  halt a push westwards by the Moslem-dominated Bosnian army.
In Gorazde, southeast of the capital, UN workers are still facing  "restrictions" of their freedom of movement in certain areas inside the  20-kilometer exclusion zone around the city. Shots were fired at a team of UN  engineers there without anyone getting hurt, but the source of the fire could  not be determined, the spokesman said.
A UNHCR spokesman said no aid convoy had yet managed to reach the southern  part of the Moslem enclave at Bihac in the west since May 17.
