Japan's industrial production in April fell 1.4  percent from March and declined 1.5 percent from a year earlier, the Ministry  of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said Monday.
The decline in the ministry's index of mining and manufacturing followed a  4.6 percent increase in March after falling 0.1 percent in February, MITI  officials said.
Ministry officials said that production appeared to be hitting bottom but  final demand still remained uncertain, adding that it was necessary to  continue closely monitoring the data.
A production outlook index for the manufacturing sector is forecast to  decline 1.4 percent in May but rise 1.3 percent in June.
The ministry said shipments in April fell 1.6 percent compared to March,  which saw a 4.8 percent rise over February.
The ratio of April inventory to sales declined 0.7 percent after a 5.3  percent fall in the previous month.
