Otis Elevators signed a joint venture deal with a  Vietnamese partner Wednesday, marking its return 19 years after being forced  out of the country at the end of the Vietnam War.
The firm, a subsidiary of United Technologies, is to sell and service  elevators in the north of the country in partnership with Lilama, a  state-owned industrial construction firm, in the hope of riding Vietnam's  growing wave of construction.
Otis first installed an elevator here in 1929 in what is now the  Presidential Palace, said Vernon Stait, president of Asia-Pacific operations.
Some 100 Otis elevators and escalators fitted before 1975 are still  operating, Stait said, adding that this gave the company a lead in what is  likely to turn into a competitive market.
Potential for sales in Vietnam was considerable as the country moves to  address a serious shortage of offices, hotels and housing, he said.
Large numbers of high-rises are expected to go up in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh  City in the next few years as both cities are suffering from a lack of office  space and housing for foreign executives.
Otis, the first elevator manufacturer to set up here, began talks with its  Vietnamese partners before the lifting of the US trade embargo in February.
