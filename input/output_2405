Governor Chris Patten was leaving for London on  Friday for his third trip to Britain in five months, with talks on the House  of Commons foreign affairs committee's report on Hong Kong high on his agenda.
Patten is also to discuss Amnesty International's demand for an  independent human rights commission in the colony -- which reverts to China in  1997 -- when he sees Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and other officials.
"I am going to argue as strongly as I can in support of what was said in  the Foreign Affairs Committee report," he told a press briefing several hours  prior to departure.
The report from the all-party committee endorsed Patten's efforts to  extend democracy in Hong Kong ahead of 1997, in the face of fierce opposition  from China.
Patten is also to make several speeches during his week-long trip,  including one at a black-tie dinner with British media magnates on Tuesday in  London and another on Friday in Manchester, home to a large Hong Kong Chinese  community.
His trip comes as Prime Minister John Major, a close friend of the  governor, and his Conservative government is being dogged by sagging  popularity among British voters.
