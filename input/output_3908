The International Committee of the Red Cross  evacuated 800 Somali refugees from the Yemen war zone to sites well away from  the fighting, the organisation said here Wednesday.
The Somalis left the camp at Al Koud, 50 kilometres (30 miles) east of the  key southern stronghold of Aden, to four sites east of Zinjibar, away from the  frontlines.
Situated in the middle of the war zone, the refugee camp at Al Koud has  been hit several times since fighting started between northern and southern  Yemeni forces three weeks ago. Several hundred of the refugees have been  killed by shelling, the Red Cross said.
The organisation agreed on May 14 to evacuate some 1,500 refugees from the  camp but said the warring parties had been slow to give security guarantees.
