Russian President Boris Yeltsin said Friday he  warned his Ukrainian counterpart Leonid Kravchuk to refrain from using force  against the secessionnist republic of Crimea, Interfax reported.
"There cannot be in any instance any forceful actions undertaken against  Crimea", Yeltsin said he told Kravchuk, adding: "Crimea is a sovereign  (eds:correct) republic within Ukraine and has the right to its own political  stand and the right to make its own decisions".
The Russian leader said Kravchuk reassured him during the telephone  conversation held Thursday by saying: "That's the way it will be."
Yeltsin stressed that Russia as well as central authorities in Kiev should  not meddle in Crimean affairs, saying that "neither we, nor Ukraine" have the  right to intervene.
The Crimean parliament voted Friday to restore a 1992 constitution in a  move that amounted to a declaration of independence.
The constitution establishes treaty relations between Kiev and Crimea,  allows a Crimean citizenship, and provides for forming a local militia force.
