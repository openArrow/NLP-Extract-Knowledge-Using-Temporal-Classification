Italian Endrio Leoni won a photo-finish mass  sprint to take the fifth stage of the Tour of Italy here on Thursday.
It was his second success of the Giro, after he won a mass sprint on the  opening day of the race at Bologna.
Russian Evgeni Berzin retained the overall race lead after a quiet 158km  run between Campobasso and Melfi which saw the top riders declare a truce  until the finish.
Leoni edged out another Italian, Fabio Baldato, with both riders  acclaiming victory by raising their arms as they crossed the line.
Meanwhile race favourite Miguel Indurain, who led the peleton in the final  kilometres alongside Berzin and Italian Gianni Bugno, made a rare appearance  in the sprint and came fifth.
"I was a good sprinter as an amateur," Indurain joked. But his performance  was not good enough to win him a time bons for a top-three finish.
The 215km sixth stage on Friday runs from Potenza to Caserte.
