Three of the five biggest Japanese non-life  insurance companies announced declines in pre-tax earnings for the year to  March while two said their profits were modestly higher, in statements on  Tuesday.
But all five companies projected flat, to only slightly higher, earnings  for the current year, owing to declines in investment income.
The five -- Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co. Ltd., Yasuda Marine and  Fire Insurance Co. Ltd., Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance Co. Ltd., Sumitomo  Marine and Fire Insurance Co. Ltd. and Nippon Marine and Fire Insurance Co.  Ltd. -- all reported higher net premium income with an average increase of 5.6  percent.
Tokio, the country's largest non-life insurance company accounting for  almost 20 percent of the primary market, said that pre-tax earnings had fallen  by 8.5 percent from the figure a year earlier to 76.6 billion yen (744 million  dollars). Net premium income rose by five percent to 1,190 billion yen in the  same period.
The company, a member of the Mitsubishi group, forecast earnings of 78  billion yen for this year with premium income rising to 1,240 billion yen.
Yasuda, affiliated with Fuji Bank Ltd., said earnings had fallen by 11  percent to 32.95 billion yen on premium income of 852 billion yen, up six  percent. In the current year, Japan's second-biggest non-life insurer forecast  slightly higher earnings of 34 billion yen on income of 885 billion yen.
Mitsui, ranked third, said its earnings were down by 19 percent to 23.1  billion yen on increased premium income of of 583 billion yen, up 6.3 percent.  The company forecast a profit of 24 billion yen for the current year with net  premium income rising to 610 billion yen.
Sumitomo managed to boost its earnings by 4.1 percent to 30.6 billion yen  in the same period with premium income rising 7.1 percent to 502 billion yen.  But the company forecast a slightly lower profit of 30 billion yen for this  year despite higher premium income of 520 billion yen.
Nippon Fire and Marine, affiliated with Sanwa Bank Ltd., said its profit  rose 1.7 percent to 19 billion yen on premium income of 409 billion yen, up  3.6 percent from a year earlier. The company forecast a further increase in  profit to 25 billion yen this year with premium income rising to 425 billion  yen.
