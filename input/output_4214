A Russian military satellite was missing Thursday,  24 hours after its launch, and was believed to have plunged back to earth,  officials said.
The Russian military space command said the Kosmos 2281 satellite,  launched Wednesday aboard a Tsiklone-3 rocket from the Plessetsk cosmodrome,  probably fell to earth in the Siberian Sea off northern Siberia after the  apparent failure of the rocket's second and third stages to separate.
It said preliminary indications were that the top stages and the satellite  crashed into the Siberian Sea where the second stage should have fallen  following a normal separation.
The Tsiklone rocket has been in use since 1977 and Wednesday's mishap was  the fifth failure in 110 launches.
The last failed launch occured in May 1993.
