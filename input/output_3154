A military engineer was killed Monday when a bomb  destroyed his car as he drove out of the Spanish capital, police said.
Police blamed the blast, which occured at 8:30 a.m. (0630 GMT), on the  outlawed Basque separatist guerilla movement ETA, but no group claimed  responsibility for the attack.
The car was destroyed in the blast, which killed occupant Lieutenant  Miguel Peralta Utrera, a 47-year-old (eds: correct) father of four.
The bomb went off after Utrera stopped at a service station shortly after  leaving his home in the military compound of Virgen del Puerto, scene of  earlier ETA attacks, to travel to a nearby barracks.
Early investigations suggested the explosive device had been placed under  the car chassis and had been timed to go off as Utrera got in the vehicle.
Instead, it went off several minutes later on a crowded access road  towards Madrid, sparking a huge rush-hour traffic jam.
Justice Minister Juan Alberto Belloch visited the scene.
