A strike called by ground engineers of the  national carrier Indian Airlines disrupted flight schedules across India for  the fourth day Thursday following a logjam in talks, officials said here.
Hundreds of passengers were stranded in airports across the country as the  protest for higher wages saw flights being cancelled, diverted or delayed,  reports said.
However a spokesman for the airline said the situation had "improved  considerably" with 61 of the 122 flights countrywide operating on schedule.
