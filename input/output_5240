Canadian rookie Jacques Villeneuve joined a select group by leading seven  laps of the Indianapolis 500. Winner Al Unser Jnr and long-time leader Emerson  Fittipaldi were the only others so fortunate.
The son of late Formula One star Gilles Villeneuve was the fastest  first-time qualifier ever at Indy and his second-place finish all-but assures  race rookie of the year honors. But he still had trouble believing he was  ahead.
"It was great to lead the race," he said. "I saw the pit flash me the  number one and I thought I was a lap behind. Then I saw my number go up on top  of the scoring tower." (AFP)
