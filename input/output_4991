Thousands of jobless people took to the streets of  Paris and Marseille on Saturday to join marches against "unemployment and  exclusion" from society.
Some 150 "permanent marchers" who have criss-crossed the country in recent  weeks to campaign against unemployment told a Paris crowd which organisers put  at 40,000 it was time to "finish with resignation and exclusion and (time to)  promote a different logic to create jobs."
Police put the crowd at between 10,000 and 15,000.
Some 60 organisations from across the country were represented at the  three-hour march to call for the "abolition" of unemployment. Banners demanded  "everyone for work, work for everyone," and called for a 35-hour work week.
Some march organisers expressed disappointment that most of the country's  large unions, with the exception of the pro-communist CGT, did not take part  in Saturday's protest marches.
In the southern city of Marseille, some 3,000 marchers called on political  and economic leaders to secure jobs and the Bouches-du-Rhone departement's  economic potential.
