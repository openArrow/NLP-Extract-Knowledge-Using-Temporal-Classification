American teenager Michael Fay, whose caning for  vandalism sparked a protest by the US government, turned 19 in a Singapore  prison Monday but could not receive any visitors or presents, his mother said.
Randy Chan said she was not attempting to see her son before a scheduled  visit on Tuesday under prison regulations allowing family meetings every two  weeks.
"We debated going to visit him today and we discussed it at the last  meeting with him but he knows (the prison authority) would make it difficult  especially as my next visit is (Tuesday)," Chan said.
"I have bought him a baseball cap and some music tapes," she said.
But Fay will not get the birthday gifts until his release scheduled for  June 21 because prison rules allow only three books to be given to prisoners.
"No messages, no birthday cards," Chan, who remarried Chinese-American  Marco Chan who is employed by American courier company Federal Express, said.
Fay, from Kettering, Ohio, was sentenced to six strokes of a rattan cane,  four months in jail and a fine on March 31 after he admitted spray-painting  cars, pelting them with eggs and keeping stolen road signs.
He later said he was coerced into confessing crimes he did not commit, a  claim the Singapore government disputes.
Fay's six strokes was reduced to four by the government in response to  public appeals by US President Bill Clinton to call off the caning condemned  by US newspapers as barbaric.
Chan said her former husband, George Fay, would come to Singapore to take  their son home when he is released from prison.
