A man, believed to be a right-wing political  activist, fired a pistol at former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa here  Monday but missed, police said.
The attacker was immediately overpowered, they said.
Hosokawa was attacked when he was standing in front of a Tokyo hotel after  attending a meeting, police said.
Further details were not immediately available.
Hosokawa, the leader of the Japan New Party, one of the main groups  forming the ruling coalition, resigned as prime minister last month after  questions were raised over his financial dealings.
