The Georgian government and several politicial  parties Wednesday signed a peace pact here, promising an end to political  violence, though several key opposition groups refused to sign.
The document was signed by President Edward Shevardnadze's Citizens'  Union, the opposition National Democratic Party, the radical nationalist  Popular Front and the Green Party.
However politicians do not expect opposition to Shevardnadze to end with  the pact and several small opposition groups, including the radical  monarchists, refused to sign the vaguely-worded peace document.
A demonstration against the Shevardnadze government has been organised for  Thursday and the opposition has continued to criticise a peace accord signed  earlier this month with separatists in the western republic of Abkhazia.
Under the accord, signed May 14, more than 200,000 Georgian refugees are  to return to Abkhazia and a CIS peacekeeping force is to be sent there, aimed  at ending 13 months of fighting between Abkhazian and Georgian forces.
Former prime minister Tengiz Sigua and former defence minister Tengiz  Kitovani, two key opposition figures, refused to sign the peace pact Wednesday.
The Georgian pact seemed to be modelled on an agreement signed in Moscow  at the end of April.
Dozens of political groupings signed the Russian pact, renouncing  political violence ahead of the next presidential elections in June 1996.
However several opposition parties, including those gathered around former  vice president Alexander Rutskoi, refused to sign the document.
