Bolivia, playing in their first World Cup finals  since 1950, will be calling on the devil as they bid to create an upset in the  opening match against Germany.
Marco Etcheverry, the country's best known player, is known as "El Diablo"  (the devil) because of his lethal left foot and playmaking skills.
Etcheverry was the architect of Bolivia's sensational 2-0 win over Brazil  in the qualifying competition but he believes it is the influence of coach  Xavier Azkargorta that has made all the difference.
Azkargorta, a Basque who worked as a journalist before taking over the  national side in January last year, has concentrated on overcoming the  traditional inferiority complex among Bolivian players.
"He has totally changed our way of thinking," said Etcheverry. "He has  brought out the winning mentality within us."
Azkargorta added: "Bolivia used to take the field already losing 1-0. It  made them realise our opponents are human just like us. Whatever happens in  the United States we shall not be beaten by a negative attitude."
Critics said Bolivia only qualified by playing home games in the rarefied  atmosphere of La Paz but Azkargorta is quick to point out that the Bolivian  capital has always been high in the Andes and has not brought success to the  national side before.
Apart from Etcheverry, Bolivia's key players are Milton Melgar and Carlos  Borja, plus fellow midfielder Erwin Sanchez.
Sanchez, 24, who plays for Boavista in Portugal, is an elegant midfield  playmaker in Etcheverry's mould. And like Etcheverry he knows his way to goal.
Borja, 33, is a rugged ball-winner, who will allow the likes of Etcheverry  and Sanchez to use their skills. Melgar is one of his country's most popular  players. And though slowing down at 34, his passing is still as crisp and  accurate as ever.
