A parliamentary commission called Thursday for  former Conservative prime minister Constantine Mitsotakis to be tried for his  alleged involvement in a telephone tapping scandal, Socialist Party sources  said.
The commission of inquiry called for Mitsotakis to answer charges of  "moral involvement" in illegal phone-tapping between 1988 and 1990, abuse of  power, and breaking laws on ministerial reponsibility, said sources in the  governing Socialist Party (PASOK).
The accusations date back to April 1993, when Christos Mavrikis, a former  employee of the Hellenic Telecommunications Office (OTE) accused the former  premier and his daughter, ex-culture minister Dora Bakoyannis, of running a  vast network of taps against PASOK leaders and journalists.
In December a judicial inquiry into the claims passed a report to the  commission, which is dominated by PASOK members, implicating Mitsotakis and  his daughter in the scam.
The commission decided unanimously Thursday not to press charges against  Bakoyannis over the affair, the sources said.
The commission's report will be presented to parliament Tuesday and  debated by the legislature after next month's European elections, the sources  said.
Separately, parliament is due to rule Friday on calls from PASOK for a  second commission of inquiry into the 1992 sale by the then Mitsotakis-led  administration of the Aget-Herakles cement works to a subsidiary of the  Italian Ferrruzzi conglomerate.
PASOK has denounced the sale as a scandal and demanded that Mitsotakis and  two of his former ministers bear responsibility.
PASOK defeated Mitsotakis' New Democracy party in general elections last  October.
