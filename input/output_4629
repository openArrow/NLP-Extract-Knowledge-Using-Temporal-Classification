HSBC Holdings said that first-quarter pre-tax  profits showed an "improvement" over the figure a year ago despite "difficult"  trading conditions in the bond markets, in a statement on Friday.
Bad-debt charges had fallen in the United States.
Sir William Purves, chairman of the Hong Kong banking group, also said at  an annual general meeting that in 1994 HSBC would benefit from "improved  business conditons in the United States and Britain and from continued growth  in Asian economies."
The exact quarterly figures were not available.
"We are particularly well-placed to take advantage of the opportunities  that are presented by the continued opening of markets in China and India," he  said.
Purves added that the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of talks under the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the adoption of the North  American Free Trade Agreement would also be favourable for the company and the  global market place.
He said that the decision by US President Bill Clinton on Thursday to  allows Most Favoured Nation trade status to China and to separate trade  matters from human rights considerations would also be important for HSBC.
In 1993, the group, which owns Britain's Midland bank, earned 2.584  billion pounds (3.819 billion dollars) in pre-tax profits representing an  increase of 53 percent rise from the figure in 1992.
