German lawmakers squeezed a controversial abortion  bill through the lower house, the Bundestag, by a four-vote margin Thursday,  opening the way for the jailing of fathers who force their partners to have an  abortion.
But the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) vowed to block the measure in  the upper house, the Bundesrat.
The law on abortion has been in turmoil since the Constitutional Court a  year ago threw out key provisions of a 1992 bill allowing abortion during the  first 12 weeks of pregnancy, provided the expectant mother sought professional  advice.
The text was an attempt to harmonise the abortion laws of the former West  Germany, where abortion was illegal except on medical or psychological  grounds, and of East Germany, where abortion was free on demand during the  first 12 weeks of the pregnancy.
Upholding the move to end penalties for abortions during the first 12  weeks, the Constitutional Court nevertheless refused to decriminalise  terminations, so that the cost of abortions would not be reimbursed by social  security.
Under the new bill, only expectant mothers in dire straits will be  refunded for an abortion, and the cost will be borne by local, not federal  taxes, which the SPD opposes.
The bill would also allow courts to jail for up to two years fathers or  families of expectant mothers who forced them to have an abortion, a move the  SPD says is unenforceable.
Anti-abortion activists say that some 350,000 women a year have abortions  in Germany.
In Poland, the Diet, or lower house, was due Friday to debate a bill to  soften the staunchly Catholic country's strict anti-abortion law.
Around 150 former communist lawmakers have put their names to a bill which  would allow abortion in cases where the expectant mother was facing severe  material or personal hardship.
At present abortion is banned unless the mother's life is in danger, or  the baby is the result of rape or incest, or the foetus is severely and  irreversibly damaged.
