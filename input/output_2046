The prime minister designate of Rwanda, Faustin  Twagiramoungou, Thursday held talks with French foreign staff on the crisis in  his country wracked by an ethnic bloodbath, a ministry official said.
Twagiramoungou, who became premier after Rwanda plunged into the strife  that is believed to have claimed as many as 500,000 lives in six weeks,  arrived from Brussels on Wednesday at the invitation of France.
His visit showed Paris's concern for to see "that a political solution is  found to the Rwandan conflict," the spokesman said.
The mainly Tutsi rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) refuse to  recognise the government, which was formed after the death of president  Juvenal Habyarimana in a mysterious plane crash on April 6, sparking clashes  among the Tutsi minority and the Hutu majority.
Most of those slaughtered have been Tutsis or moderate Hutus opposed to  Hutu hardliners.
