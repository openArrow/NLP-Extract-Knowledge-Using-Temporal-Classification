A total of 270 pilgrims were killed  in Monday's stampede at Mecca, Saudi authorities announced on Thursday.
An official Saudi spokesman, quoted by the Saudi news agency SPA said on  Thursday that the toll included people killed on Monday and those who had died  since in hospital from their injuries.
The figure was the first official toll from the stampede which happened  during the ritual "stoning of Satan" at Mina, 10 kilometres (six miles) east  of Mecca.
Saudi authorities have blamed the stampede on the "record number" of  pilgrims, who numbered more than 1.5 million at the site.
The spokesman said Saudi officials were still unable to give the  nationalities of 143 of the dead.
The 127 others comprised 44 Pakistanis, 18 Indians, 11 Egyptians, eight  Nigerians, seven Moroccans, six Saudis, six Indonesians, six Algerians, six  Bangladeshis, five Turks, two Sudanese, one Yemeni, one Jordanian, one  Iranian, one Ghanaian, one Afghan, one Mauritian and one Dane.
The spokesman said the accident happened because of the pilgrims' "failure  to follow instructions" given at the ritual which consists of throwing stones  at steles representing Satan.
"Hundreds of thousands of people rushed to accomplish the rite, provoking  an enormous crush.... inspite of appeals for order in all languages broadcast  by loudspeaker," the spokesman said.
The pilgrimage to Mecca, one of the five pillars of Islam, has been marked  by several accidents in recent years.
In July 1990, more than 1,400 pilgrims were killed in a stampede in a  tunnel at Mina and in 1987, clashes between Saudi police and Iranian pilgrims  left 402 dead including 275 Iranians.
