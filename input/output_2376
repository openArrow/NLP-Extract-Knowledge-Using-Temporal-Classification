Kravchuk said Thursday ahead of the vote that Kiev had "enough force" to  oblige Crimea to respect the Ukrainian constitution.
Also Thursday, Ukraine ordered the takeover of police forces in the  Crimean peninsula in what local officials charged was a military coup against  the Crimean leadership.
Valery Kuznetsov, Crimea's acting interior minster, told a session of the  local parliament Thursday that Ukrainian Deputy Interior Minister Valentin  Nedrigailo had presented him with a decree signed by President Leonid Kravchuk  and ordering the takeover.
"A military coup d'etat is underway", Kuznetsov said after the Kiev  official arrived with a group of 15 elite troops from the Ukrainian interior  ministry.
But Ukrainian security services said about 15 troops arrived overnight at  the military airport in Belbek, near Sevastopol, and that they were simply  accompanying Nedrigailo on his trip.
Russia's Interfax news agency quoted the Ukrainian interior ministry as  confirming that Kravchuk had issued a decree placing Crimean police forces  under Kiev's control.
The decree reportedly appointed new officials to the posts of Crimean  security chief and head of interior forces in the autonomous republic.
But the Crimean parliament reacted by voting to name Kuznetsov as Crimean  interior minister and appointing its own candidate as security minister.
The ITAR-TASS news agency quoted sources from the Black Sea fleet, based  in the Crimean port of Sevastopol, as saying that 1,000 elite troops and  members of the national guard had arrived overnight in two airfields near the  city.
But the Ukrainian defence ministry categorically denied that report.
