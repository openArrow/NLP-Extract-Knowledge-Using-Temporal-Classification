Tangerine dreamers Dundee United sent their fans  into raptures and vindicated Serbian manager Ivan Golac's apparent blind  optimism by beating treble-chasing Glasgow Rangers 1-0 in the Scottish FA Cup  final.
Golac had refused to contemplate anything but victory at Hampden Park,  despite United having failed in six previous finals, and striker Craig  Brewster repaid his faith with probably the easiest goal of his career.
United were worthy of their triumph as they had dominated an out-of-touch  Rangers for most of the game, and threatened on several occasions before  beaking the deadlock in the 47th minute.
There was a touch of the bizarre about the goal. Rangers defender Dave  McPherson passed back to goalkeeper Ally Maxwell, whose attempted clearance  cannoned off Christian Dailly.
The keeper failed to recover, allowing the United striker to screw the  ball across goal from a tight angle and as it came back off the far post  Brewster was on hand to slam it in.
Rangers, bidding for a back-to-back treble, had almost struck first in 10  minutes when McPherson's header from a corner was cleared off the line by Jim  McInally.
United swept to the other end and they were unlucky not to be awarded a  penalty when Ian Ferguson appeared to foul Alex Cleland as he was poised to  shoot.
