The Monaco Grand Prix got off to a dramatic start  on Sunday, when Damon Hill's Williams-Renault shunted into the back of Mika  Hakkinen's McLaren-Peugeot, forcing both men out of the race.
The low-speed accident came within the opening seconds, when both men  headed into the first bend after race leader Michael Schumacher.
Drivers, officials and motorsport fans were praying for an accident-free  race on this relatively slow street circuit, following Karl Wendlinger's crash  here on Thursday which has left the Austrian in a deep coma.
The legendary race is also the first since Ayrton Senna and Roland  Ratzenberger were killed at the San Marino Grand Prix two weeks ago.
Schumacher, out in front of the two Ferraris, has won all three previous  races this season.
