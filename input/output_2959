Italian authorities probing whether former prime  minister Giulio Andreotti met with a Mafia boss are looking at a 1987 Sicily  visit during which he vanished for five hours, judicial officials said Sunday.
Mafia turncoats say Andreotti cancelled all appointments, gave his local  security detail time off and slipped away with his permanent body guards to  meet with Toto Riina, the don of the Sicilian Mafia, the sources said.
One of the turncoats, Baldassare Di Maggio, said he saw Andreotti embrace  Riina in true Mafia style.
Andreotti, then foreign minister, was in Palermo for a meeting of his  Christian Democratic Party.
Around 50 people have been questioned in an effort to find out where  Andreotti was for those five hours and what he did.
Di Maggio, Riina's former driver, says Andreotti met with Riina at the  Palermo home of Ignazio Salvo, a businessman who served as the mob's agent for  dealings with politicians. The mayor of Palermo, Salvo Lima, was also there,  Di Maggio says.
Andreotti allegedly approached one of his former bodyguards recently just  as the agent was to be interrogated on the five-hour period, sources said.
Andreotti, a 75-year-old powerhouse of Italian politics who served as  prime minister seven times, has been under investigation for alleged collusion  with the Mafia since March last year.
He denies all the charges against him. He says that with all the security  surrounding him, it would have been impossible to meet with a Mafia don  without someone catching on.
Italian prosecutors in Palermo asked a judge Saturday to indict him on  charges of colluding with the Mafia. The judge can accept or reject the motion.
Andreotti is a senator for life but had his parliamentary immunity lifted  in June of last year. He himself has asked to stand trial and clear his name.
