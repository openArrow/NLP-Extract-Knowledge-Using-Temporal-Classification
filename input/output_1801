Capello said after the victory: "I am so proud of my team. They played  superbly. They never allowed Barcelona to settle and the fact that we were the  underdogs probably helped us.
The Italian manager refused to be drawn into any feud with Cruyff and he  brushed aside sugestions that Wednesday's triumph had also been a personal  revenge over the Barcelona boss.
Cruyff, who had hinted that Milan had lost their sparkle since Capello  took over, shrugged off the defeat.
"We did not lose tonight because we used the wrong tactics. We lost  because Milan won all of the 50/50 balls. They dominated the match and made  good use of their possession.
"Barcelona aren't used to being deprived of the ball. And when you haven't  got the ball, you can't attack and you can't score goals."
Barcelona's goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta admitted: "They played better  and faster than us. Both teams needed to be at 100 percent tonight and Milan  played the perfect match.
Milan's two-goal scorer Daniele Massaro said: "This is the most wonderful  night of my life. I shall never forget it. Everybody thought we were a  defensive team only. Tonight we proved the contrary.
