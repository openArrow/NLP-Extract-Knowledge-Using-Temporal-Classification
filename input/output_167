A Spanish fighter plane on NATO  maneuvers crashed into the Mediterranean Friday after one of its engines  caught fire but the pilot managed to eject and was unhurt, the Spanish Defense  Ministry said.
The pilot of the Harrier was quickly rescued by a Spanish Navy helicopter.
His plane, taking part in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's  so-called Dynamic Impact exercises, went down off Majorca, near the tiny  island of Cabrera, part of the Balearic Islands off Spain's east coast.
The ministry said when the pilot realized an engine was on fire, he tried  to head back to an air base at Palma de Majorca but finally had to bail out.
