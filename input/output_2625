Jens Reich is the joker among the four candidates --  a serious political challenger, while being a rank outsider.
Without the backing of one of the three main parties of government as the  others have, he has no chance at all of being elected.
But Reich says his very political independence gives his candidacy  strength, as the president should be independent.
Reich, 55, was a leading figure in the groundswell of popular opposition  in East Germany that brought the Berlin Wall crashing down in 1989. Since then  he has championed the cause of equality among Germans, east and west.
A professor of molecular biology, he has the support of the  Alliance-90/Greens party, of independent intellectuals, and of the rebellious  leftwingers of the SPD's youthwing.
Reich was a deputy of the New Forum movement in the short-lived first  freely-elected parliament for East Germany in the period just before  reunification, from March to December 1990.
Retired from politics for a while after he failed to be re-elected in  all-Germany elections in 1990, his return to the foreground incarnates East  Germans' disappointment with the brash capitalist assimilation of their state.
