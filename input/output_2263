Jurassic Park star Sam Neil has filed a complaint  with New Zealand's privacy commissioner after aerial photos of his exclusive  alpine home appeared in a newspaper, the New Zealand Herald reported Friday.
Northern Ireland-born Neil, who grew up here, has built a housing complex  around a lake near Queenstown on the South Island.
The Herald said a Queenstown newspaper, Mountain Scene, featured a photo  of the home in its "Wonder Homes" section.
The Herald said Neil's lawyer, Simon Stamers-Smith, had complained to  Privacy Commissioner Bruce Slane that the article and photo were a "gross  breach" of the Privacy Act.
He said Neil, whose other roles have seen him in "The Hunt for Red  October," "The Piano" and "Reilly, Ace of Spies," was a very private man.
"He was very annoyed with Mountain Scene for grossly invading his privacy,  as he views it, without his consent, taking photos of his house, and printing  it in Mountain Scene," he said.
Mountain Scene publisher Frank Marvin said news gathering activities were  exempt from the Privacy Act.
He said a "small plethora" of multi-million dollar estates were going up  around Queenstown.
"It is a topic of local debate, which makes it news with a capital N,"  Marvin said.
Slane was not commenting on the complaint.
