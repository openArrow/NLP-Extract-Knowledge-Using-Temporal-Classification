Thailand's Supreme Court has acquitted a local man  accused of the 1989 murder of a Saudi diplomat, saying witnesses could not  remember enough detail of the killer's face, reports said Saturday.
Judge Jaran Hatthakam on Friday freed Adinan Songkerwala, 26, who had  denied shooting Saleh Abdullah Al-Maliki, 35, a third secretary at the Saudi  Embassy, the news reports said.
Al-Maliki was shot several times with a 6.35 mm pistol in front of his  apartment in central Bangkok. The assassin fled.
Three witnesses identified Adinan as the killer, but Jaran noted they had  said they could not remember much detail about the assassin because they were  in shock.
Police believe Al-Maliki was ordered killed by owners of Thai job  placement agencies because he uncovered forged documents prepared by the  agencies and refused visas to Thai workers.
Three other Saudi embassy employees and a Saudi businessman were killed in  1989 and 1990. The five deaths and the theft of 20 million dollars in gems  from a Saudi prince by a Thai servant led Riyad in 1990 to downgrade its  embassy and stop issuing Thais visas.
Thailand last year declared that international terrorists had killed the  four embassy employees. A police lieutenant colonel is on trial for the  kidnapping and death of the businessman.
Eight Thais, all but one a policeman, are on trial in the gems case, in  which some of the jewelry was never returned and much of what was given back  was fake.
Interior Ministry officials are considering indicting eight more officers  in the case, including former police chief Sawasdi Amornvivat and Police  General Sanong Wattanawarangkul.
