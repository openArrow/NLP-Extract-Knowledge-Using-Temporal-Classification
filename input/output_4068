The 15-member Security Council voted  unanimously Wednesday to end a 17-year-old UN arms embargo on South Africa.
The council also voted to dissolve a security committee created in 1977 to  monitor affairs in South Africa. The committee played a key role in the  anti-apartheid movement at the United Nations in the 1970s and 1980s.
In passing Resolution 919, the Security Council said elections in South  Africa and the subsequent inauguration of President Nelson Mandela have  established in South Africa a united, democratic and non-racial government.
The Security Council also underscored the urgent necessity to facilitate  the process of South African reintegration in the international community and  in the United Nations.
"I can think of no better wish to offer the new South Africa than that it  should never figure on the agenda of the Security Council again," said Sir  David Hannay, Britain's representative at the United Nations.
