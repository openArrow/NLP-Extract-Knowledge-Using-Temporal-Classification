German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on Saturday  called on European Union states to offer economic aid to Croatia and speed up  moves to seal an association treaty with the former Yugoslav republic.
Efforts to secure peace in the war-torn Balkans should be rewarded, Kinkel  added, an apparent reference to Croatia's role in persuading its Bosnian Croat  allies to form a federation with Moslems in neighbouring Bosnia-Hercegovina.
"I am going to work to ensure that the European Union resumes economic and  financial cooperation with Croatia," Kinkel said in a statement released by  the foreign ministry here.
"The parties at war (in the former Yugoslavia) must recognise that efforts  towards peace must be rewarded," he said, adding that "aggressors cannot count  on receiving any support in the rebuilding of their country."
Germany has long been an ally of Croatia and has held secessionist Bosnian  Serbs responsible for the two-year conflict which has torn the former Yugoslav  republic apart.
The German minister said he would call for Croatia to receive aid under  the EU's Phare development scheme for central and eastern European states, and  press for "negotiations on a treaty of association (between Croatia and the  EU) to be relaunched."
Germany takes over the rotating presidency of the European Union from  Greece on July 1.
In Geneva, the Bosnian Moslem government and Bosnian Croat representatives  Saturday marked their agreement to set up a federation in Bosnia with a  ceremony in the presence of US Secretary of State Warren Christopher but fell  short of signing a document..
Also present at the ceremony in the US embassy in Geneva, and representing  the government in Zagreb, was the Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic.
Originally, a formal signing ceremony had been expected in Geneva Saturday  for the federation agreement.
