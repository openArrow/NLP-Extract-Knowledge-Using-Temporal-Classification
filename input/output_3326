Bosnian army tanks opened fire on Brcko Monday  evening, wounding six people in the Serb-held town in northeastern Bosnia, the  Bosnian Serb news agency Srna said.
The tanks opened fire from positions south of the town, firing around 30  rounds, the agency said.
Brcko dominates a corridor linking Serb-held land in western Bosnia and in  Croatia with Serbia proper to the east. The corridor narrows at Brcko itself,  so western military observers have expressed fear that the Serbs might launch  an offensive to try to widen it.
The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said a UN team visited the areas of Brcko  hit in Monday's attack.
Brcko has been attacked by artillery four times in the past 12 days,  leaving five people dead and 18 wounded, Tanjug said.
