England's Laura Davies carded a  two-under-par 69 here Saturday to snatch a share of the third-round lead in  the LPGA Championship, level with Meg Mallon on 211.
Davies, the top money-winner on the women's tour this season, jumped from  fourth place to the top of the leaderboard, assisted by Mallon's bogeys at 13  and 15.
Alice Ritzman, seeking her first victory in 402 LPGA Tour tournaments,  missed a chance to join the leaders when she bogeyed the last hole to complete  a 71 for 212.
She was tied with defending champion Patty Sheehan, who posted a one-over  72.
Sweden's Liselotte Neumann carded the best round of the tournament so far,  a 67, to stand tied with Beth Daniel at 214.
Davies birdied three of the last seven holes to put herself in contention  for her third tournament victory of the year.
"Obviously it's nice to get right in there and be tied for the lead," she  said. "Now I know that if I shoot the lowest round tomorrow, I'll win."
Davies said she was striking the ball well, and could have built up a  cushion on the field she had had a bit more luck.
"That's the best I ever hit, on number eight right through 17," she said.  "I played well, and that's the main thing. I've got good thoughts going into  tomorrow."
Neumann's low round was highlighted by a 176-footer for eagle on the  par-four second hole.
"That hole owed me big time," she said. "When I hit that shot, I was  really pumped up."
Ritzman, winless in 17 years on the tour, was delighted with her position,  achieved despite an painful left shoulder.
"Yes, I have a chance to win," she said. "I didn't think I'd be able to  play golf with an injured shoulder, so this is a treat."
