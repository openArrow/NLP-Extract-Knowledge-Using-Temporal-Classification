But Delors insisted that some proposed projects might not be attractive to  private investors because they were too environmentally-demanding or too  long-term.
The private sector was more interested in 10-year investments than  projects which might take three decades to complete, he said.
Earlier this year the commission proposed that the EU raise a six-year  loan of 48 billion Ecu (54 billion dollar) to finance some of the projects,  which include highways, highspeed railways and a trans-Alpine rail crossing.
In the face of general scepticism on the part of finance ministers, the EU  executive has since dropped all public reference to the extent of financing  needs.
But Delors warned that the growth plan, which is supposed to be the  centrepiece of an EU summit next June, would make little progress unless the  EU showed quickly that it was ready to back its projects with public loans.
Clarke said the EU was making little headway on the other major plank of  the plan -- to lighten non-wage costs for European businessmen which include  labour regulations and social charges to support welfare systems.
Supporting the German proposition for an independent study of EU law, the  British chancellor said: "You cannot make progress on deregulation if you  leave it to your own bureaucracy."
However, French Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery said he doubted the  need for outside checks on the EU's work.
