The Kremlin apartment of the founder of the Soviet  state has been shut for a year and its contents moved to his home outside  Moscow to permit renovations, the news agency ITAR-TASS reported Saturday.
Lenin's Kremlin apartment had been preserved as it was during his  lifetime, and his furniture and boxes containing 42,000 articles were moved  earlier this week to the museum at Leninskiye Gorky, the house where he died,  ITAR-TASS said.
The official order concerning the move notes that it is temporary, and  points out that government services in the rest of the Kremlin building  affected have also had to be transferred elsewhere.
But it appears unlikely that Lenin's Kremlin apartment, where he lived  from March 1918 to October 1923, will reopen to the public. The apartment  became a museum in 1955.
The move follows the closure in November of the Lenin museum at the  entrance to Red Square, leaving the mausoleum containing Lenin's mummified  body as the last place in the vicinity of the Kremlin to hold a relic of the  Soviet leader.
