US Secretary of State Warren Christopher called on  PLO leader Yasser Arafat Wednesday to stick to pledges to end violence and  asked him to explain his recent call for "holy war" to liberate Jerusalem.
Christopher said: "It is very important that chairman Arafat keeps his  commitment to violence and terrorism. It is important for him to understand  the importance of the remarks he made."
The secretary, speaking during a joint press conference with Egyptian  President Hosni Mubarak, said he was "looking forward to clarification" of  Arafat's remarks.
In Oslo Arafat said Wednesday that his reported remarks should not be seen  as hostile to Israel but rather an appeal to strive for complete Middle East  peace.
Controversy flared Tuesday when Israeli radio broadcast what it said was a  speech given by Arafat on May 10 in a Johannesburg mosque in which he called  on Moslems to "take part in a jihad (holy war) to liberate Jerusalem."
But Arafat said that he had used the term jihad in its religious sense,  not a political one, which covered a whole variety of things from persuasion  to armed conflict.
"For your information," he told reporters, "we can say, 'I will continue  my jihad to achieve peace' in an Islamic, in a religious way."
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin had warned Tuesday in Israel that if  Arafat's remarks were confirmed, it "calls into question the peace process."
Arafat pledged an end to violence in letters exchanged with Israel in  September.
