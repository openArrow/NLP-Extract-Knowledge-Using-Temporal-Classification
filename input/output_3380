Amnesty International accused Rwanda's  government Monday of starting and supporting bloody massacres of minority  ethnic-Tutsis over the past two months.
"Rwandese armed forces and government appear to be responsible for  inciting, perpetrating and condoning mass killings, particularly of members of  the Tutsi ethnic group," the London-based human rights group said in a report  issued at the United Nations.
"The majority of the victims were killed while unarmed or were trapped in  churches and other public places where they hoped they would be protected,"  the report said.
Amnesty said that government officials had been working to incite majority  Hutus to kill Tutsis since October 1990 and that "virtually no one who has  incited or perpetrated violence against a Tutsi has been brought to justice."
The group urged the United Nations to investigate the genocidal killings  and to prevent further human rights abuses in Rwanda, where death toll  estimates have reached half a million since fighting began in early March.
Meanwhile, talks were under way at UN headquarters in New York on plans  for sending peacekeepers to the bloodied east African country.
The Security Council authorised the deployment of 5,500 blue helmets after  the UN came under heavy criticism for withdrawing all but 400 of its 2,500  ceasefire monitors last month.
