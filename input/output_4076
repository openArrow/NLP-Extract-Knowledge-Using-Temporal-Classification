Eurotunnel is planning to launch its 850 million  pounds (1,275 million dollar) rights issue Thursday at a big discount,  reflecting uncertainties over future revenues of the Channel tunnel operator,  said the Financial Times.
The rights issue price is expected to be about 260 pence for each  Eurotunnel unit, which would be 27 percent below Wednesday's 355 pence closing  market price in London, said the paper.
It added that the expected rights price is only about 10 pence above the  250 pence floor that would permit Eurotunnel to raise sufficient equity  finance to allow its vital 1.6 billion pounds (2.4 billion dollars)  refinancing to take place.
The company has authority to issue only 350 million new shares.
Investment institutions have been reluctant to underwrite the share offer.  They have been concerned that all earnings from the tunnel will be swallowed  by interest payments on about eight billion pounds (12 billion dollars) of  debt until at least 1998 and there will be no dividend until 2003.
Brokers said the underwriting challenge was made more difficult by the  sharp fall in the stock market at the FT-SE 100 index fell 68.4 points to  close at 3,020.7.
However, the price of Eurotunnel units -- an unusual security twinning  British and French shares -- fell only five pence to 355.
The costs of completing the tunnel linking Britain and France were well  above original forecasts. Its problems have been compounded by the delayed  start of freight and passenger services, which means revenues in the early  years of operation will be lower than it had hoped.
