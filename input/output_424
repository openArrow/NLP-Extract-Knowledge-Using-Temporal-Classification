The Singapore High Court has made a landmark sex  equality ruling that a house-husband can claim a share of his working wife's  property in a divorce, a report said Saturday.
Judicial Commissioner K.S. Rajah ruled Friday that the unemployed man  looking after the household was entitled to similar rights as women given  benefits in matrimonial property disputes, the Straits Times reported.
The couple, whose identity was not disclosed, had been married for 26  years and divorced last year.
The husband "housewife" demanded a a share of a flat worth 355,000  Singapore dollars (233,000 US). He was awarded 50,000 Singapore dollars.
The 55-year-old husband, described as a freelance Christian pastor, said  he cooked, cleaned the house and looked after the three children while the  wife worked.
The wife, 48, claimed she paid for the purchase of the house with her  earnings and her husband did not make any financial contribution.
In ordering the 50,000 Singapore dollar payment, the judge said he had  taken into consideration the oustanding mortage of 84,000 Singapore dollars.
The report said the husband could not be contacted as he had gone to  Malaysia. The woman told reporters she was too upset to talk about the matter.
