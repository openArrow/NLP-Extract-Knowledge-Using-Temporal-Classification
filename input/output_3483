Japanese precision equipment manufacturer Shimadzu  Corp. said Tuesday its pre-tax earnings grew 9.2 percent from a year earlier  to 3.3 billion yen (32 million dolars) in the year to March despite lower  sales.
The affiliate of the Mitsubishi group said sales declined 3.9 percent to  163 billion yen, depressed by lower export revenue and reduced sales of  scientific and processing instruments, aircraft equipment and industrial  machinery.
Shimadzu forecast a further profit increase to 4.8 billion yen in the  current year with sales recovering to 168 billion yen.
In the latest year, sales of scientific and processing equipment dropped  3.6 percent to 72 billion yen as sales of aircraft equipment and industrial  machinery slumped 14.8 percent to about 40 billion yen. But sales of medical  equipment rose 6.4 percent to 50 billion yen. Exports sagged 11.7 percent to  36 billion yen, adversely affected by the strong yen.
