The future government of the newly-autonomous  Palestinian territories of the Gaza Strip and Jericho held its first meeting  at PLO headquarters here Thursday, correspondents on the spot said.
Seventeen of the 19 ministers so far named to serve on the 24-strong  Palestinian National Authority were spotted at a photo-session before the  start of the meeting, photographers said.
The two absentees were Professor Sari Nusseiba, a professor at Bir Zeit  University and Abdelhadiz al-Ashhab, a doctor from Hebron, both in the Israeli  occupied West Bank.
Cairo-based Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) negotiator Jamil  Tarifi, who is tipped to serve in the new administration, was at the meeting,  as were two PLO executive committee members, Farouk Kaddumi and Mahmud Abbas,  correspondents said.
Meanwhile Israeli Police Minister Moshe Shahal said in Jerusalem that PLO  chairman Yasser Arafat would make his entry into the autonomous territories on  June 15.
Shahal told Israeli television that the Israeli government had received a  message saying that Arafat, who has been suffering from exhaustion this week,  wanted to postpone his arrival from June 6 to June 15.
But a spokesman for Israeli premier Yitzhak Rabin's office denied that the  government had received any such message from the PLO or had fixed the date of  Arafat's arrival.
A source in Tunis said Thursday that Arafat was still having his wife's  uncle, London-based businessman George Hawa, detained on suspicion of  corruption.
The source said Arafat did not want Hawa, who was reportedly arrested last  Friday, hauled before a court, but wanted to make an example of him.
Suha Arafat told the Arabic daily al-Hayat in Tunis that her uncle was not  under arrest, and denied rumours that his reported detention could lead her to  divorce Arafat.
