Britain's Prince Charles arrived Monday  in Saint Petersburg for a three-day visit, the first by a British royal to the  former Russian imperial capital in 100 years.
The heir to the British throne was scheduled to visit the tomb of Russia's  last imperial family, the Romanovs, overthrown and murdered by the Bolsheviks  in 1917. The Romanovs were related by blood to the British royal family.
