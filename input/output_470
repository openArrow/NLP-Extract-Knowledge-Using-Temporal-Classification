Police blocked off the Georgian capital Tbilisi  Saturday as parliament debated a controversial peace accord with the  separatist republic of Abkhazia.
Some 7,000 police were in the streets as well as blocking entry and exit  to the city, an interior ministry spokesman said. Interior Minister Shota  Kviraia directed the "anti-crime" operation personally, he added.
Police had by late morning seized more than 30 automatic arms and pistols.
Several armored cars had taken up positions earlier Saturday, reinforcing  police checkpoints already in place for several days in the center of the  town, witnesses said.
President Eduard Shevardnadze submitted Friday his resignation and  proposed abolishing the presidency to protest the deputies' refusal to ratify  the accord towards settling the conflict with breakaway Abkhazia in western  Georgia.
The deputies fear the accord will authorize the secession of Abkhazia. The  accord, to be signed Sunday by Georgian and Abkhazian delegations in Moscow,  calls for deploying Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) troops in a  12-kilometre (7.2 mile) security zone separating Abkhazia from the rest of  Georgia.
A Shevardnadze spokesman said Saturday that the president did not intend  to resign but to examine proposals by deputies to adopt a purely parliamentary  government system.
Ramaz Sakavarelidze, Shevardnadze's press officer, quoted by the Georgia  news agency Iprinda said that Shevardnadze would in any case remain  parliamentary speaker, a post to which he was elected in October 1992.
Shevardnadze has been head of state since his election in November 1992.
On September 14 last year, he resigned for several hours to protest  parliament's refusal to give him full powers.
Georgia has been hit since becoming independent in 1991 by a series of  political crises, including two civil wars and the Abkhazian secession  struggle, at a time when the national economy is in ruins.
