Krickstein, often referred to as the forgotten man of American tennis,  plunged down the rankings after being away from the circuit for nearly a year  after breaking his foot in 1992. He was ranked sixth in the world just four  years ago.
Now 26-years-old, the 1989 US Open semi-finalist remains a realist.
"I never mind playing the top players in the early rounds of a Grand Slam  tournament. And playing the five-set format probably suits me. I'm pretty fit  and people have to play well to beat me.
"But I know I shall have to play better if I am to get further in the  tournament. It wasn't great tennis out there today. But Stich isn't the  world's second-best player when it comes to playing on clay."
Michael Chang, the youngest ever winner of the French Open when he beat  Edberg in the 1989 final at the age of 17 yrs and three months, dropped a set  but took a nap during a three-hour rain break.
He returned refreshed and completed a 4-6, 6-0, 6-4, 6-2 victory over  Spain's experienced Jordi Arrese.
Chang, who is seeded eighth, now plays Jaime Yzaga. The Peruvian beat  Jared Palmer 7-6 (7/3), 6-4, 4-6, 6-1.
Pioline, seeded 14th, was jeered off the centre-court by the home fans  after being soundly beaten by Spain's Alberto Berasategui.
It was a highly erratic performance by the 24-year-old Frenchman whose  career has gone into a heady dive since he soared into the 'top-ten' after  reaching five finals last year.
Berasategui, who beat Jim Courier to win the Nice Open, never looked in  danger and raced home 6-4, 7-5, 6-3.
