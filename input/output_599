Vietnam is planning to spend 1.8 billion dollars to  upgrade Ho Chi Minh City's airport into one of the largest in the region,  capable of handling 50 million passengers a year, a report said Sunday.
Teams from the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation Department have  completed a feasibility study into plans for Tan Son Nhat airport, once the  busiest in Southeast Asia when it served as the main airbase for US forces in  Vietnam before 1975, the Vietnam Investment Review said.
Some 400 million dollars are to be spent in the next three years to build  a new international terminal capable of handling eight million passengers a  year, the newspaper of the State Committee for Cooperation and Investment  said.
Passenger traffic trebled between 1990 and 1993, with 24 international and  domestic airlines now using the airport.
Some 1.6 million passengers passed through Tan Son Nhat last year and the  figure is expected to grow to eight million by 2000, the newspaper said. If  the plan is completed by 2010, the airport will be capable of handling between  40 million and 50 million passengers a year.
Currently the airport only handles around 30,000 tonnes of cargo a year,  but new facilities will increase capacity 10-fold and will allow 46 large  cargo jets to use the terminal at any one time.
The airport, located a short distance from the centre of Ho Chi Minh City,  currently handles around 50 flights a day but facilities are limited and  overstretched.
Many travellers have also complained about widespread corruption and  bureaucratic problems at the airport, the main gateway into Vietnam.
