The other player safely through in the men's singles was Aaron Krickstein.  The American, who put out second-seed Michael Stich in the previous round,  defeated Czech Radomir Vasek 6-3, 1-6, 6-3, 6-3.
One of the outside courts soon became unapproachable when it was learned  that Steffi Graf had teamed up with Henri Leconte.
Hundreds jammed round to watch the German world number-one and Leconte win  an entertaining first-round clash against French opponents Sybile Noix-Chateau  and Jean-Philippe Fleurian 7-6 (8/6), 6-1
Graf turned to the Frenchman to join her in the event after entering her  Swiss coach Heinz Gunthardt. Gunthardt, who didn't know he had been entered,   decided, when he heard that he would be better off staying out of competition.
