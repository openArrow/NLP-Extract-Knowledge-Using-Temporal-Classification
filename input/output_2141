"As a top athlete I'm expected to be part of a team. On the Norwegian  national team I must concentrate on the line with the other athletes, and I  don't have time for that," Koss said.
Koss won the hearts of fans worldwide for donating his 225,000 kroner  (30,000 dollar) victory bonus to Olympic Aid for Sarajevo.
"What I achieved during the Olympics made the decision much easier. I had  achieved the goals I had set for myself," he said.
But achieving those goals also affected his motivation. Topping such a  spectacular season would have been near impossible, although quitting  international competition does not mean he intends to hang up his skates for  good.
"Skating is great exercise," he said, and added that he could consider  participating in skating marathons.
Koss said he will miss the skating scene and his competitors most of all.
"Skating has been my life since I was 14. I want to keep in touch, but it  won't be the same," he lamented.
Koss now hopes to combine his knowledge of skating with his medical  studies.
"I'm interested in the physiological side of training, and I hope I can  contribute with what I know," he said.
Koss said he is relieved that the decision is finally taken and that the  Norwegian Skating Federation did not try to pressure him to stay on.
On the contrary, the skating federation praised Koss for his years of  dedication.
"We want to thank Johann for what he has meant to Norwegian skating. We  will of course miss him, both as a skater and as a person, but we fully  support and respect the decision he has taken," federation president Odd  Pedersen said.
