Leading European stock markets were mixed on  Friday, as the London bourse lost 0.6 percent but prices rose moderately in  Paris and Frankfurt.
London traders said prices there had been affected by the futures market's  decline and the prospect of a rise in US interest rates next week. On the last  day of the trading account, the Footsie 100-share index lose 18.6 points or  0.6 percent to finish at 3,119.2, though it had opened with a slight gain of  3.7 points. Gilts gained up to 3/4 of a point.
Share volume was 699 million, little changed from 701.4 million on  Thursday.
Among the most active issues, Unilever plummeted 57 pence to end at 1,023  pence after announcing a smaller-than-expected rise in net profit for the  first quarter.
Cable and Wireless was down five to 455, affected by worries about  competition for its Mercury portable phone subsidiary. British Airways was off  five to 391 after announcing it was maintaining flights between London and  Paris-Orly despite the French government's opposition.
RTZ rose 10 pence to 858 on brokers' buy recommendations, while the  Telegraph Group was up nine to 620 on good quarterly results.
The Paris Bourse was helped by a slight dip in long-term interest rates  and the CAC 40 index gained 0.47 percent on the day to end at 2,187.00 points,  after an opening rise of 0.26 percent. The indicator had been up as much as  1.36 percent during the session before easing back in late afternoon.
The Bourse was closed on Thursday.
One operator commented that while the Bourse had not forgotten fears of  higher US interst rates, it was encouraged on Friday by good employment  figures in France and satisfactory results reported by some French companies.
LVMH luxury goods group gained 1.01 percent on the day, Generale des Eaux  0.38, and Michelin 1.29 percent. L'Oreal advanced 2.44 percent.
The Frankfurt stock market notched up a respectable gain on Friday, though  trading was narrow because of a long Ascension weekend being taken by many  investors, traders said. The DAX index finished the day at 2,258.75 points, up  0.67 percent by comparison with the Wednesday close (Thursday having been a  holiday).
Traders said the Friday gain was partly due to the Bundesbank's surprise  decision on Wednesday to lower both the discount and the Lombard rate by half  a point, said one broker from Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
He said the market expects further rate cuts, but that has already been  taken into account in share prices. "Investors are now more intent on company  results" than on German monetary policy, he said.
The Friday session's star was Metallgesellschaft, which rocketed up 42  marks to end at 285 following a buy recommendation by Union Bank of  Switzerland.
Banks performed well, Commerzbank rising 1.50 marks to 364.50 and Dresdner  Bank 3.50 to 405.50, while Deutsche Bank was unchanged at 791.50 marks.
Allianz rose 52 marks to 2,697 and Daimler six to 893, but Siemens was off  0.70 to 731.80.
The bond market rose, boosted by the Bundesbank move, and the average  yield on government issues fell by 0.03 percent to 6.32 percent.
