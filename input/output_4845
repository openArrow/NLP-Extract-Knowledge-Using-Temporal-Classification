A new peace plan for Yemen was presented  Friday to the Security Council by Oman, which will take over the chairmanship  of the council next Wednesday, diplomats said.
The plan calls for an immediate ceasefire and a resumption of talks  between the north and south, which have been at war since May 5, Arab and  western diplomats said.
The draft, which will be discussed next week in New York, also calls on  member nations to immediately halt delivery of all weapons and other military  equipment.
In Yemen Friday, fighting raged around the Al-Anad military base near the  southern stronghold of Aden. Fighting has centered on the key base since the  war broke out.
