Saudi riot police took up positions around the  Iranian pilgrims camp at Mecca Saturday where a political rally is due to be  held despite a Saudi ban, the official agency IRNA said.
Three days ahead of Tuesday's planned anti-US and anti-Israel  demonstrations, police were deployed on both sides of the entrance to the  camp, while about 10 police cars and armoured vehicles were stationed in the  streets opposite, the agency said.
It also charged that two cameras, placed on the roofs of two tall  buildings across the street, were filming all movements to and from the camp  around the clock.
Saudi authorities warned last week that it would not allow Iranian  pilgrims to carry out their demonstrations.
The warning came after the head of the Iranian pilgrims delegation,  Mohammad Mohammad Rey-Shahri, said taking part in the demonstration was an  Islamic duty.
Similar demonstrations have triggered clashes with Saudi police in the  past, the most violent being in 1987, when 400 pilgrims, including 275  Iranians, were killed. Diplomatic ties between the two countries were broken  off for three years afterwards.
Tehran and Riyadh are also in dispute over the the numbers of Iranian  pilgrims allowed in Mecca this year. Iran says Saudia Arabia has halved its  quota of pilgrims to 60,000.
But Riyadh countered that it was applying a quota system agreed with other  Islamic countries allowing one pilgrim for every thousand people.
The annual Moslem pilgrimage is to start on May 19 in Mecca, the birth  place of the prophet Mohammad and Islam's holiest shrine.
