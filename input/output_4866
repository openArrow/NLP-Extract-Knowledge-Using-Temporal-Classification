The South Korean economy grew 8.8 percent in the  three months up to March, the biggest quarterly gain since 1991, the central  Bank of Korea (BOK) said Saturday.
The bank said the gross national product (GNP) growth rate, calculated on  a year-to-year basis, was the highest since the 10.7 percent figure in the  second quarter of 1991.
The robust growth, which outstripped expectations, was fueled by a surge  in facility investment and a sharp increase in exports.
Facility investment shot up 20.2 percent, the highest in six years.  Exports grew 8.9 percent, thanks mainly to the stronger yen that made Korean  products cheaper in overseas markets, and to the economic recovery in  developed countries.
BOK director Kim Myong-Ho told journalists he foresaw the growth trend  continuing for the rest of the year, adding that the economy was expected to  grow seven percent for the whole year. The BOK earlier predicted a 6.3 percent  growth.
Analysts said the growth rate should not been seen calculated on a  year-to-year basis could be misleading if taken as an indicator that the  economy was overheating.
The first-quarter growth rate appeared very high because the same figure  for 1993 was low at around four percent.
