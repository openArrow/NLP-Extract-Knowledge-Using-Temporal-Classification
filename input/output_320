A group of Norwegian tourists were held up  and robbed at gunpoint here Friday only minutes after their plane touched  down, said police.
The five Norwegians were onboard a hotel shuttle bus when one of two young  men who had joined them, pulled out a gun and demanded cash and jewelery.
Police say one tourist was hit and injured during the raid.
The two men fled after ordering the driver to pull-off the expressway and  stop.
