British Trade Minister Richard Needham flew  here Monday armed with a secret message from Prime Minister John Major amid  speculation Malaysia is soon to lift a near three-month boycott of British  firms.
"I want to talk to him (Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad) about the ideas  that I bring with me for the future of Malaysian-British relationship,"  Needham was quoted by Bernama news agency as saying on arrival for a two-day  visit.
Needham said he was carrying the "original" of a letter from Major to be  delivered to Mahathir, who had already received a copy of it.
Needham, scheduled to hold talks with Mahathir on Tuesday, declined to  comment on the contents of the letter, saying "that's a matter for the two  prime ministers."
"Of course, I hope the ban will end as quickly as possible because we've  got so many things we want to do in common," Needham said.
Malaysia had barred British firms from bidding for government contracts  since February 25, following reports in the British media of corruption in  Anglo-Malaysian trade and in Mahathir's administration.
London's Sunday Times was singled out for its February 20 article alleging  links between Mahathir and British construction firm Wimpey International.
Mahathir on Sunday acknowledged a ceasefire by the British media against  his country but said he needed more assurances to end the boycott which was  said to have cost British firms lucrative infrastructure contracts.
"We notice an improvement, particularly after the person (London's Sunday  Times editor Andrew Neil) who started such reports, had been transferred,"  Mahathir said.
Neil was recently seconded to work in New York for the next seven months  on a current affairs programme for the Fox Television network.
The network and the Sunday Times are both controlled by media baron Rupert  Murdoch.
Needham was also scheduled to hold talks with Malaysia's International  Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz.
