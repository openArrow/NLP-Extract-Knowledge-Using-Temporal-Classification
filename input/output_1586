China dismissed as "sheer fabrication" Wednesday  reports that it was preparing the trial for treason of the country's most  celebrated dissident Wei Jingsheng.
"Inquiries with the departments concerned show that these are a sheer  fabrication," a foreign ministry spokesman said, referring to foreign press  reports that Wei was about to be tried for plotting to overthrow the  government using foreign forces.
The Public Security Ministry also denied that a formal decision had been  made to bring Wei to trial, saying that his case was still under  investigation.
"Wei Jingsheng violated Chinese law while he was released on parole and  his political rights were withdrawn, and the police are in the process of  investigating his case," a ministry spokesman said.
Reports quoting the ministry as saying Wei's case had been handed over to  the Chinese courts were "completely false," he said.
Wei, 44, was picked up by police April 1 as he tried to return to Beijing  from a forced exile in nearby Tianjin. The authorities then announced that he  was being investigated for unspecified new crimes.
Wei was released on parole in September last year, having served all but  six months of a 15-year sentence for counter-revoltionary activities.
The Chinese authorities were incensed when Wei met here in February with  US Assistant Secretary of State for Humanitarian Affairs John Shattuck and  called on Washington to take a hard line with Beijing over human rights.
