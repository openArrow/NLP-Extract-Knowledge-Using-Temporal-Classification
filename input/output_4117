Clashes between Burmese government troops and the  forces of warlord Khun Sa have eased off in the past three days after Rangoon  used jet fighters against the private Shan state army, a Thai military  spokesman said Thursday.
Thailand's Third Army Region spokesman, Colonel Prasit Mongkholtham, told  reporters than an unspecified number of jet fighters had flown missions May 17  and 18 against Khun Sa's men.
The fighters operated at a high altitude because of fears the Shan forces  would use Sam-7 missiles against them, Prasit said. He gave no details of the  missions flown by the fighters.
On May 21, the Bangkok Post reported the heaviest fighting in 40 years  near Tachilek, across from Mae Sai in Thailand's northern Chiang Rai province.
A district official in Mae Sai told AFP by telephone Thursday that the  region's police chief and other senior officials were on an inspection tour of  the border area.
They had given instructions that any would-be refugees with weapons must  be disarmed before being allowed to cross the border, the official said.
Prasit said that more than 2,000 of Khun Sa's Muang Tai Army (MTA) had on  May 11 retaken the town of Jod, which had fell to government troops late last  year.
But MTA men were forced to withdraw after the jet fighters went into  action, Prasit said.
In recent days, some 500 Burmese men who said they were fleeing forced  porter duty with Rangoon troops were sent back by Thai authorities at the  border.
Prasit said Rangoon regarded Khun Sa and his forces as an economic  interest group more than an ethnic group -- like the Karen and Mon -- seeking  political autonomy.
Prasit said Thailand was keeping a close watch on the situation, but so  far the clashes were at some distance from the border and had not affected  Thai villagers.
