Tobacco kills almost half a million people per  year in the European Community, Social Affairs Commissioner Padraig Flynn said  Tuesday on a "day without tobacco" organised by the World Health Organisation.
"This year, in the European Community, almost a million people will learn  they have cancer, around 850,000 will succumb to the disease, and close on  250,000 of these deaths will be tobacco-related," the commissioner said in a  statement issued here.
"If we add to these the 200,000 deaths due to cardio-vascular illnesses  caused by smoking, we find that tobacco kills every year, in the Community, at  least 450,000 people," Flynn said.
He said the EU would be maintaining its campaign to cut down smoking by  means of bans on television advertising for tobacco products, information  initiatives regarding the effects of tobacco, and other activities.
