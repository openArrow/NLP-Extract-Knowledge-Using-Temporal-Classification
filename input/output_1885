Japan's NKK Corp. is negotiating with the Vietnamee  government to produce steel billets in the suburbs of Hanoi, a company  spokesman said Thursday.
The Japanese steelmaker, along with trading company Mitsubishi Corp.,  plans to complete a feasibility study for the project by December in the hope  of setting up a joint venture early next year, the spokesman said.
NKK hopes to build a plant in Cai Lan with annual production of 500,000  tonnes, to be supplied to affiliates of Vietnam Steel Corp., he said.
