The White House said Thursday that the United  States and France had reached a "common approach" on Bosnia-Hercegovina, one  day before a Geneva meeting on the former Yugoslav republic.
In a brief statement, the White House said that President Bill Clinton and  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe "agreed the ministerial meeting offers as  an important opportunity for the US, France and the international community to  continue copperative efforts to press the parties to the conflict to negotiate  a political settlement."
Juppe arrived in Washington on Wednesday, determined to convince  Washington to force Bosnia's warring parties to agree to a peace plan.
"It is not a matter of imposing a peace plan on the parties that they  don't want but of putting pressure on them to accept it," he said.
Clinton on the other hand, had backed a plan to convince Europe to lift  the arms embargo on Bosnia's Moslems.
Juppe met with the president at the Oval office early Thursday to discuss  Bosnia.
Leaving the White House, Juppe said he was pleased with the "convergence"  between Washington and Paris, but he also acknowledged that there were stil   details to work out.
The Geneva conference Friday will bring together the foreign ministers of  Britain, France, Germany, Russia and the United States, as well as Belgium and  Greece.
