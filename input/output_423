Vetaran Malawi President Hastings Kamuzu Banda,  facing challenges from three presidential contenders in multi-party elections  on Tuesday, said Saturday his work of ruling Malawi was not yet finished.
Banda, believed to be in his 90s, said in a 20-minute speech on state  radio that the future Malawi needed an experienced leader like him.
"The future holds challenges and dangers, needed to be led by the  experienced and capable government of Kamuzu," he said.
Describing the elections as historic, Banda said Malawi needed politicians  of ability, honour and good reputation.
"MCP (the ruling Malawi Congress Party) has that ability, skill ,  integrity and experience," he said.
Banda, accused of serious human rights abuses during his three decades in  power, said his government would respect human rights and uphold good and  accountable government.
''We will limit state power by laws,'' he said.
Banda's address was his last campaign effort after cutting short his  campaign tour of the country due to a "leg problem."
