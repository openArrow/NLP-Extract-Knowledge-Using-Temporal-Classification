Fifth-seed Goran Ivanisevic saved the show at the  French Open on blustery but sunny centre-court at the Roland Garros Stadium  here on Monday when he surged into the quarter-finals of the men's singles  with a four-set victory over Italian Andrea Gaudenzi.
Ivanisevic, the last seeded player still surviving in the bottom-half of  the men's draw, saw off the challenge of 34th ranked Italian with a 6-2, 5-7,  6-4, 6-3 victory and now faces Spanish newcomer Alberto Berasategui.
The 22-year-old Croatian thumped down fifteen aces in the 2hrs 5Omin  showdown which was marred with a line-call controversy in the fourth-game of  the final set in which a furious Gaudenzi copped a warning.
German referee Zoldan Bognar over-ruled a linesman on a baseline call on a  point which would have given him a break point for a 3-1 lead.
"The ball was clearly long," shrugged Ivanisevivc after the match. "These  things happen."
It had been very different just minutes earlier when the umpire had  briefly left the court. The Italian playfully climbed up into his chair and  announced "Game, Set and Match Gaudenzi."
Ivanisevic, playing in his sixth French Open, is hoping to improve on two  previous quarter-final appearances in 1990 and 1992.
Certainly his next opponent won't have been too happy with the result.  Berasategui had admitted earlier this week that Ivanisevic's tennis didn't  suit his game.
