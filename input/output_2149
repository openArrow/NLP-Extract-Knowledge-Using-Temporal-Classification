A policeman and two armed kidnappers were killed  Thursday in a shootout in central Moscow after two women were taken hostage in  a shop, the Interfax agency said.
The shootout happened after three armed men entered the store near Gorky  Park Thursday afternoon and took the women hostage, the agency said.
They barricaded themselves inside the store, which contained a currency  exchange booth and, according to some reports, demanded a ransom of a million  dollars and a tanker truck to flee the city.
The kidnappers fired on police, who arrived at the scene after the shop's  alarm system was activated, shooting one of the officers who later died from  his wounds, the agency said.
Special interior ministry troops were then deployed. After trying in vain  to negotiate with the kidnappers, they attacked the premises at around 8:30  p.m. (1630 GMT), using an armoured car and tear gas.
The troops killed two of the kidnappers, arrested the third, and freed  both hostages unharmed, Interfax added.
