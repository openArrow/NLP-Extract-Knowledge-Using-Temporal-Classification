In Port-au-Prince meanwhile, army-backed interim president Emile  Jonaissant said a US invasion to restore Aristide would be a crime.
"What can we do against the United States?" asked Jonassaint, whose  government has not been recognized by the international community, at a press  conference at the National Palace.
"They could reduce us to ashes in a minute," he added.
Jonassaint also announced that Haitians seeking to flee the country for  the United States would face punishment if they are returned, indicating his  regime would enforce a 1980 decree providing for penalties for clandestine  emigration.
US officials said discussions were continuing with France and Britain on  use of their Caribbean territories as temporary refugee processing centers.
Since Clinton's May 8 announcement on a shift in policy on Haitian  refugees, the United States has been seeking a third country to allow  interviews of Haitian refugees to determine who qualifies for political asylum.
The US government will also use ships at sea for the interviews.
US officials said France and Britain want assurances that the Haitians  would not remain for extended periods if refused asylum in the United States.
Washington is discussing use of the French overseas departments of  Guadeloupe and Martinique and the British dependent territory Turks and Caicos.
Since Clinton announced the new policy, there has been a sharp increase in  Haitians intercepted at sea, but all have been repatriated by the US Coast  Guard because the new system has not been put into effect.
