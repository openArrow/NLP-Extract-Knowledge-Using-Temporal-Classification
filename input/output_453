The Patriarch of All Russia Metropolitan Aleksei II  left Moscow on Saturday with a delegation of officials from the Russian  Orthodox church for a five-day official visit for former Yugoslavia.
The patriarch, who was invited by the Serbian Orthodox church, said before  leaving that he considered his visit "a peace mission aimed at ending the  bloodbath in former Yugoslavia."
The Russian delegation will visit Serbia, Montenegro and  Bosnia-Hercegovina, in particular the capital Sarajevo.
Meetings are scheduled with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and the  president of the rump Yugoslav republic, Zoran Lilic, but none with Bosnian or  Croat leaders figure on the delegation's official programme.
