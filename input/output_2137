European football's governing body UEFA have  proposed that half the eight extra places for the 1998 World Cup finals in  France go to the regions providing this year's semi-finalists.
In the last two tournaments Europe had three semi-finalists, with  Argentina representing South America, and in 1982 all four semi-finalists were  from Europe.
UEFA's executive committee said Africa, Asia, Oceania and the  Caribbean/North American region known as CONCACAF should each have one extra  place.
They also said the holders should no longer qualify automatically.
Europe already has 13 of the 24 finalists and their project is bound to  run into fierce opposition from the rest of the world.
