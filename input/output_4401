President Bill Clinton announced Thursday he  was renewing China's most favored nation trading status for another year and  delinking the trade issue from human rights for the future.
But he said he would impose limited sanctions on Beijing to pressure it to  continue to improve its human rights record.
"I have decided that the United States should renew most favored nation  trading status for China," Clinton said.
