The Ferranti defence business has been sold to  GEC-Marconi, a 100-percent-owned subsidiary of British group General Electric  Co. (GEC), Ferranti receivers announced here on Friday.
The receivers, from Arthur Andersen chartered accountants, did not  indicate the value of the deal, which becomes effective Thursday evening.  According to the British press, the amount should be around 50 million pounds.
GEC is taking over Ferranti Defence Systems Integration (FDSI) and  Ferranti Simulation and Training (FS and T), which employ 1,110 people between  them.
The receivers said the deal opens the way to finalization in the next few  weeks of negotiations concerning Ferranti satellite communications and  civilian and industrial activities.
At the end of March, the receivers designated GEC as the favored candidate  for acquisition of the main Ferranti defence activities and said an  agreement-in-principle had been reached on the matter. They said separate  negotiations on other Ferranti activities would continue with other interested  companies.
Ferranti Group started sliding into slow bankruptcy four years ago with  the discovery of a large-scale fraud involving fake contracts at its US  subsidiary, International Signal and Control (ISC), bought in 1987.
