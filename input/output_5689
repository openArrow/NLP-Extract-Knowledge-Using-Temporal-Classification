Russia's special envoy to ex-Yugoslavia Vitaly  Churkin held talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday, part  of a bid to give impetus to peace negotiations set to resume in Geneva later  this week, Serbian television said.
No details were immediately available on the talks, which took place after  Churkin arrived from Zagreb. He was expected to return there later in the day  to meet with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman.
Diplomatic sources said Churkin was expected to meet also with Serbian  leaders from the breakaway state of Krajina, inside Croatia.
UN special envoy to ex-Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi last week called on  Bosnia's three warring factions -- Moslems, Croats and Serbs -- to attend  peace negotiations in Geneva on Thursday and Friday.
Churkin is expected to attend these talks along with his American  counterpart Charles Redman and peace mediators Thorvald Stoltenberg, of the  United Nations, and David Owen, of the European Union.
