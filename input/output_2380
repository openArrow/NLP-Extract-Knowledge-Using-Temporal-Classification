A court granted bail Friday to 32 members of  a white extremist movement accused of being behind a bombing spree that killed  21 people ahead of South Africa's first all-race election.
The state had strongly opposed the granting of bail during the four-day  hearing on the grounds that the Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB) men could  attempt to flee.
But counsel for the accused argued that the men were not involved in the  bombing blitz and would stand trial to prove their innocence.
The magistrate in the Johannesburg Regional Court said the state had not  proved that freeing the men on bail would be detrimental to the cause of  justice.
The hearing was adjourned until later Friday for the setting of bail terms  and conditions.
The 32 were arrested at a shooting range in Rustenberg, a North-West  Province stronghold of the neo-Nazi AWB, as South Africans went to the polls  in the historic election held from April 26-29.
Police are still searching for eight other right-wingers in connection  with the blasts, which included two massive car bombs, one in central  Johannesburg that killed nine people, and one in nearby Germiston that left 10  ten dead.
The extremists are also being held in connection with a bomb blast at  Johannesburg's Jan Smuts airport, which caused several injuries.
The AWB is one a number of right-wing groups opposed to the new democratic  order in South Africa, and the movement has repeatedly said it will use arms  to fight for a separate white homeland.
