More than 1,000 Israeli rightwingers opposed to  the accords on Palestinian autonomy clashed with police Saturday night in  downtown Jerusalem.
Two policemen were slightly injured, police said.
The demonstrators, who included many settlers, threw bottles and chanted  "Rabin traitor" -- a reference to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's autonomy  negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organisation.
Police dispersed the protestors using truncheons and water hoses, after  the demonstrators tried to block traffic.
Dozens of people were arrested.
In Tel Aviv, further clashes erupted after some 1,000 rightwingers massed  outside the prime minister's residence to protest the accords giving self-rule  to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and Jericho on the West Bank, police said.
