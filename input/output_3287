Apart from Navratilova one other seed failed to survive the first hurdle  in the women's competition -- number thirteen Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria.
She went down to Ruxandra Dragomir of Rumania 4-6, 4-6.
There were mixed results for the partisan home crowd who enjoyed a day of  bright sunshine.
Canadian-born French number-one Mary Pierce dropped only one game to  Australia's Nicole Provis but 30-year-old Henri Leconte, a finalist in 1988,  crashed out in straight-sets to Dutchman Paul Haarhuis.
After his loss Leconte hinted that he might not play in the  stamina-sapping clay-court event again when he admitted: "I'm too slow. I feel  pain all the time I play. I have had many operations."
Elsewhere Thierry Champion clinched a thrilling five-set win over  Australian Jaime Morgan when he scored a 4-6, 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 (7/5), 9-7 win and  wild card Fabrice Santoro defeated Denmark's Kennth Carlsen 7-6 (7/3), 6-3,  6-2.
Emilio Sanchez of Spain continued his recent run of poor results when he  was beaten in four-sets by Germany's David Prinosil and Andrei Medvedev, who  has had such a remarkable return to the tour after a knee injury with  victories at the Monte Carlo Open and at Hamburg, beat Wally Masur of  Australia in straight-sets.
He was guarded after his win, however.
"I still don't feel one hundred per cent physically and I will be worried  if I have to play a five-set match. We shall have to see," he said.
The eagerly-awaited first-round showdown between sixteenth seed Richard  Krajicek and Karel Novacek, the man who nearly beat him in a thrilling  five-set quarter-final here twelve months ago, was all over in three sets.
The big Dutch player never looked back after a brilliant start and won  6-1, 7-5, 7-5.
