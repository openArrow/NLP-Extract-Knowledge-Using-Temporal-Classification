Local authorities, with the help of  police, recovered a large tract of land Monday allegedly held by Pakistan  opposition leader Nawaz Sharif illegally.
Accompanied by hundreds of armed policemen, the Punjab government  officials reclaimed 29,160 square metres (3.24 million square feet) of public  land Sharif, a former premier, allegedly fenced in around his residence.
Sharif was chief minister of Punjab province from 1985 until he became  prime minister in 1990. He resigned in July last year.
Witnesses said workers tore down the iron fence with which the land,  including two parks, had been hemmed in.
The operation, ordered by Punjab Chief Minister Manzoor Watto, a political  ally of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, came after previous warnings to the  Sharifs to vacate the land voluntarily went unheeded, officials said.
There was no immediate comment from the opposition, but Sharif's aides  said a statement would be issued later.
