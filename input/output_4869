Silangan Airways, a new domestic airline operating  in the Philippines, has been forced to suspend operations due to a management  dispute and failure to meet government conditions, an airline official said  Saturday.
Emmanuel Jimenez, head of the airline's passenger service, said they hoped  to resume operations next week after settling issues with the state aviation  agencies which led to the suspension Friday.
Civil Aeronautics Board spokesmen confirmed that Silangan had been  suspended but would not say why.
Jimenez said aviation officials were requiring Silangan to start training  Filipino crews to fly the Russian-made Yak 42-D the airline currently uses.  But he said the airline could not begin training so quickly and was asking for  more time.
He also said a quarrel among top Silangan management had led to the  expulsion by the board of chairman Vicente Araneta. Araneta however is  reported to be resisting the ouster and believed to be plannning legal action.
Silangan, set up by local businessmen led by Araneta, had started  operations in March, becoming the first airline to offer serious competition  to the national flag-carrier, Philippine Airlines on the country's domestic  routes.
Silangan, which uses a Yak 42-D and a Russian crew, leased from Aeroflot,  had been flying 11 times a day from Manila to the central city of Cebu and the  southern city of Davao, the country's main trading hubs.
A second Yak 42-D was supposed to arrive in June to service other  Philippine cities but Jimenez said they were suspending this delivery until  this matter is settled.
Earlier, Silangan officials said they eventually hoped to begin  international operations as well.
