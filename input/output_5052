Tommie Smith, the sprinter whose  raised-fist black-power salute on the Olympic victory podium in 1968 got him  thrown off the US team, was honored at the Bruce Jenner Classic athletics  meeting Saturday.
Smith, 49, was awarded a trophy commemorating his world record 200-meter  victory at the Mexico City Games. Mayor Susan Hammer declared Saturday "Tommie  Smith Day" in San Jose.
Jenner, the Olympic decathlon champion in 1976, said of Smith: "He had the  most beautiful stride I've ever seen in my life. I'm so glad we could honor  him today."
Smith, now an athletics coach at Santa Monica College, once held 11 world  records, but his accomplishments were overshadowed by the political gesture he  and teammate John Carlos made on the victory stand.
"What Tommie Smith and John Carlos did was totally unexpected," Smith  recalled. "Black athletes then were not supposed to do very much but run fast,  accept a trophy and go home."
He said he received hate mail and death threats when he returned home, but  never regretted the demonstration, which ended his amateur career.
"I knew there would be sacrifices," he said. "I knew I wouldn't be  popular. But it wasn't done for accolades. It was a need for me to contribute."
