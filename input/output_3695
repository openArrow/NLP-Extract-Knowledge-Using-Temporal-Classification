About 740 Russians have been confirmed as carriers  of the Human Immune-deficiency Virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, a parliament  official announced Tuesday.
Bella Denissenko, who chairs the parliamentary health committee, said 281  children were included in the total caseload.
Specialists estimate the number of HIV carriers unaware of their status at  over 1,000, the ITAR-TASS news agency quoted Denissenko as saying as she  presented several bills to fight the deadly disease.
Doctors were responsible for spreading the virus to half of the carriers,  she said without elaborating.
In Russia, 105 people are known to have died so far of AIDS-related  diseases, including 64 children.
The health committee will propose compulsory AIDS tests for foreigners  planning to stay in Russia for more than a month as well as blood and organ  donors.
People in several unspecified professions will also undergo tests if the  bill is approved by the Duma, or lower house of parliament, she added.
