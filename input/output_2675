Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Saleh vowed here  Saturday that his forces would capture the key port city of Aden after his  southern rivals declared an independent state.
Saleh told a press conference at the presidential palace here: "We are now  putting a military ring around Aden.
"After putting this ring around Aden our intention was not to enter the  city. However, after the announcement of separation by the south we are  obliged to enter the city at all costs."
He added: "Then the armed forces will continue to pursue the separatists  in Mukallah," a port east of Aden to where his southern rival Ali Salem  al-Baid reportedly moved his base earlier this week.
