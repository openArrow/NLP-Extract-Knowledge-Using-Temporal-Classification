A soldier idly toying with an explosives device was  responsible for a devastating weekend blast at an arms depot in the Russian  Far East which destroyed 1,600 tonnes of weapons, Russian intelligence sources  said Wednesday.
The sources, quoted by ITAR-TASS agency, said the soldier had just gone  off guard duty at the Pacific Fleet airforce depot when he stumbled upon an  electrical detonator stuffed with powder and began taking it apart with a  knife.
But the device suddenly caught fire and the soldier hurled it into dry  grass near a stock of shells before running away without warning his officers.
The blast on Saturday 100 kilometres (60 miles) from Vladivostok spread  over a 10-kilometres (six miles) radius where villages had to be evacuated.
No casualties were reported.
