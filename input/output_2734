US-Japan talks aimed at breaking a three-month  deadlock in trade negotiations went in to there third day here Saturday.
But US officials said the discussions would not start before the afternoon.
"The conversations are going well," President Bill Clinton's deputy  economic advisor Bowman Cutter said on Friday as he emerged from an almost  three-hour session.
The talks had originally been scheduled to last only one day, and the few  comments made by officials since Thursday morning have generally been hopeful.
