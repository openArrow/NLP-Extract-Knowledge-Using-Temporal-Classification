Japanese cameramaker Nikon Corp. announced Friday a  pre-tax profit of 1.1 billion yen (11 million dollars) for the year to March,  reversing a loss of 2.3 billion yen a year earlier.
But the company said sales fell 1.9 percent to 201 billion yen in the same  period, with lower sales of cameras and other products offsetting sharply  higher sales of electronic equipment such as semiconductors.
Nikon forecast a sharply higher profit of five billion yen for the current  year with sales recovering to 230 billion yen.
