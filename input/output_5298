Australia will field the new centre combination of  Matt Burke and Matthew O'Connor against Ireland in Sunday's first rugby union  international in Brisbane.
Burke, 21, and Test debutant O'Connor 23, named Monday in the Australian  team, have never formed a centre pairing at any level although they were  teammates in an under-21 Test against New Zealand last year.
The pair replace the injured combination of Tim Horan and Jason Little,  who suffered serious knee injuries during Queensland's Super Ten series win  over Natal in Durban this month.
Burke was used as a replacement winger in the final Test against South  Africa last year and started an international for the first time at fullback  against France in Bordeaux.
Burke was also considered a contender for the fullback spot for Sunday's  Test but Queenslander Matthew Pini has been awarded the position.
Pini earns his first test cap, but selectors dropped 34-test lineout  jumper Rod McCall to make way for John Eales, returning from last year's  shoulder injury to partner Garrick Morgan in the second row.
Selectors preferred to stick with 30-test veteran Tim Gavin at No.8, even  though he did not play in New South Wales' 55-18 win over Ireland last week.
The Irish have their final hit-out before the test against an Australian  XV in Mount Isa in northern Queensland on Wednesday.
Australia: Matt Pini, Damian Smith, Matthew Burke, Matthew O'Connor, David  Campese, Michael Lynagh (capt), Peter Slattery, Tony Daly, Phil Kearns, Ewen  McKenzie, John Eales, Garrick Morgan, David Wilson, Ilie Tabua, Tim Gavin.  Reserves: Daniel Herbert, Tim Wallace, George Gregan, Rod McCall, Mark  Hartill, Michael Foley
