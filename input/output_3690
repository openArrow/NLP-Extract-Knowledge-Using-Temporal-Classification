New Zealand were put to the sword by  Yorkshire's batsmen here on Monday as the county amassed a massive 408 for  five.
Yorkshire's effort was watched by new chairman of selectors Ray  Illingworth, with Aussie-born all-rounder Craig White impressing with a  lightning 59, a performance following his unbeaten century and career-best  bowling effort against Essex in the previous match.
White lashed a six and eight fours from 65 balls before being caught by  wicketkeeper Adam Parore off the erratic Heath Davis.
He was one of four Yorkshire batsmen to pass 50.
Illingworth left the ground shortly after White's innings, having seen the  best batting of the day.
Richard Blakey helped White add 99 in 19 overs. Blakey struck 13 fours in  an unbeaten 84 from 101 balls before bad light ended play, David Byas having  earlier hit 68 and Richie Richardson 63 before falling to a superb catch by  Martin Crowe.
New Zealand fielded a four-man seam attack with no spinners, and their  only consolation was an encouraging display by Michael Owens -- a late  addition to their squad -- who managed to enjoy his first day of competitive  cricket on the tour by taking 4-89 in 22 overs.
