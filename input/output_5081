Malawi's outspoken trade unionist and opposition  leader, Chakufwa Chihana, has accused President Bakili Muluzi of failing to  unite the country, divided on regional lines since May 17 general elections.
Chihana, leader of the Alliance for Democracy (AFORD), who was in third  place in the presidential elections, said Muluzi had done nothing to unite the  country, state radio reported Sunday.
Speaking to reporters in the northern district of Rumphi, where he has his  powerbase, Chihana called for unity talks between Muluzi and ex-president  Kamuzu Banda and himself.
The densely-populated south voted overwhelmingly for Muluzi who comes from  a southern district of Machinga, while the thinly populated north voted for  Chihana, and Banda drew his votes from the central region, where he comes from  - setting the scene for regional division.
"People voted because Muluzi or Chihana comes from that area," said Muluzi  last week, worried that his ruling United Democratic Front (UDF) party did not  win any parliamentary seat in the north.
Coalition talks between Muluzi's party and AFORD collapsed last week. UDF  have ruled out any coalition with Banda's Malawi Congress Party.
UDF, which won 84 of the 177 parliamentary seats, has formed a minority  government after failing to secure at least 89 seats to make 51 percent of the  working majority in parliament.
AFORD with 36 seats and the MCP with 55, make a stronger opposition in  parliament with 91 votes.
