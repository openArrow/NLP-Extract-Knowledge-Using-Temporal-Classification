Bosnian Serb forces agreed Saturday to pull 150  armed policemen out of the eastern town of Gorazde, a month after the expiry  of a NATO deadline ordering the complete withdrawal of Serb forces from the  town.
Under the agreement, due to come into force at 6:00 p.m. (1600 GMT)  Sunday, the armed Serbs will pull back from a UN-declared three kilometre (two  mile) exclusion zone around central Gorazde, UNPROFOR spokesman Major Rob  Annink said here.
"The Bosnian Serb forces have pledged to redeploy all armed personnel  outside the exclusion zone," Annink said.
The Serbs also agreed to "cease all hostilities around Gorazde" and  guaranteed UNPROFOR "complete freedom of movement" in the zone, he said.
UNPROFOR said 150 armed Serbs had remained in Gorazde after the expiry of  the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ultimatum at the end of April.
Serb sources said the men had remained as "policemen" to protect the  town's Serb population. Moslem sources said they were soldiers who had changed  uniform.
