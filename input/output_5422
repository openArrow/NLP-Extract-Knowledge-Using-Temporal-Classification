Police have arrested a teenager in  Utah for the shooting of a German couple who were sightseeing on a mountain  highway east of Los Angeles.
The 17-year-old male, whose name was not released because of his age, was  arrested Sunday while visiting a relative near Salt Lake City.
He was the third suspect arrested in the attack May 16 on Gisela Pfleger,  62, and her husband Klaus, 64, who had stopped at a roadside overlook.
Pfleger was shot in the head and died at the scene. Her husband was  hospitalized with gunshot wounds in the mouth and shoulder. He was in fair  condition Sunday.
Two other suspects in the case -- Khamchan Ketsouvannasane and Xou Yang,  both 19 -- were to be arraigned June 3. The three were booked for  investigation of murder, attempted murder and armed robbery.
