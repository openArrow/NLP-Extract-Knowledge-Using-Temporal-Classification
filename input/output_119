Three hundred Palestinian  policemen crossed into the West Bank overnight from Jordan and were heading by  bus for the Gaza Strip, an army spokesman said Friday.
The men from the Palestine Liberation Army will join 300 of their comrades  who arrived in two groups on Tuesday and Wednesday nights through the Rafah  border from Egypt.
"They crossed the Allenby Bridge early this morning and will probably  enter Gaza from the south," the spokesman said.
Meanwhile, in Jericho the Israelis handed over five buildings to 60  Palestinian officers in the early hours of Friday as a small crowd of  residents who had stayed up all night cheered on.
Another 386 policemen, formerly based in Iraq, were due to follow later   Friday, as the Israelis relinquish control of the West Bank town and the Gaza  Strip to the Palestinians under the autonomy deal signed on May 4.
And three more Palestinian police had been stuck all night at the Rafah  border because of what PLO officials described as "a big problem", but refused  to elaborate.
