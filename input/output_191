A huge blaze Friday gutted much of  Lucerne's historic 14th century tower, the Schimerturm, city officials said.
It took 150 firemen about an hour to extinguish the fire which broke out  just before dawn, sending flames licking 30 metres (yards) high, firemenn said.
The old stones of the tower, part of the city's ancient fortifications,  remained standing but the wooden bowels of the structure were totally  destroyed, officials said.
It was the second blaze in nine months to gut an historic building in the  city. In August, the Kappellbruecke -- a wooden-covered bridge -- was ravaged  by a blaze. It was rebuilt and reopened a few weeks ago.
