Singapore's Trade and Industry Minister Yeo  Cheow Tong on Thursday called on Asian countries to resist attempts by some  developed nations to impose standards for social or environmental protection  as disguised forms of protectionism.
Yeo said there was a need to convince the developed countries that "Asian  growth will result in a win-win situation for all" and that protectionism in  any form would be detrimental to everybody.
He was speaking at the opening of the four-day Junior Chamber  International Conference for the Asia Pacific region.
Yeo said the conference was taking place in the midst of tremendous  economic changes sweeping through the region with growth in Asia's booming  economies expected to hit an average of seven percent this year and also in  1995.
"In contrast, the world economic growth will only average two percent this  year and three percent in 1995." Yeo said.
He pointed out that the region's sustained economic growth had turned the  Asia-Pacific into "an economic power house, and in the process, causing  fundamental shifts in world trade and investment patterns."
Yeo said that between 1986 and 1992, the exports of Asian countries, with  the exception of Japan, had risen by an average 17 percent annually, well  ahead of the 11 percent growth in global exports.
He said the fierce competition posed by Asian exports had forced the  restructuring of whole industries in the developed countries and it had also  raised concerns in the developed countries about the so-called "threat posed  by Asian exports."
The minister said what had been overlooked was that Asian countries had  also become major importers.
"Their imports rose by an average of 18 percent per year between 1986 and  1992, compared with the 11 percent rise in global imports. The fact is that  Asian countries are now lucrative markets for both capital and consumer  goods," Yeo said.
