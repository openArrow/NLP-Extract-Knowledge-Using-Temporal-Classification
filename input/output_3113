A special federal assembly began meeting in Berlin  Monday to elect a new German head of state to succeed Richard von Weizsaecker,  who under the constitution must retire after serving two five-year terms.
The winner will be the first president elected by representatives of the  reunited Germany, and the seventh of post-war, federal Germany.
The 1,324 members of the assembly, consisting of the 662 members of the  federal parliament and an equal number of party-nominated delegates of the 16  regional parliaments, will cast their secret ballots in up to three rounds.
Strict security was in force around the historic Reichstag in Berlin where  the assembly was taking place, with the building sealed off by hundreds of  police to guard against the possibility of a terrorist attack.
Five candidates are in the running, with the late entry of the far-right  Republicans party, but the race is expected to be between the favourite Roman  Herzog and Johannes Rau.
Herzog, 60, is the candidate of the Christian Union parties led by  Chancellor Helmut Kohl. He is chairman of the constitutional court. Rau, 63,  standing for the Social Democratc, is North Rhine-Westphalia premier.
The outcome is expected to be determined by the minority Free Democrats,  who have their own candidate, Hildegard Ham-Bruecher, 73. Their votes could  split if and when she is obliged to withdraw.
In the first two rounds of voting, an absolute majority is required, but  on the third a simple majority will suffice, and the Christian Union parties  have more votes at their disposal than the Social Democrats.
There is also an independent standing with the support of the Greens  party, Jens Reich, 55, but he is an outsider.
