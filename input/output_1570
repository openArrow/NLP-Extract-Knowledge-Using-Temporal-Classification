Malaysia's central bank on Wednesday unloaded  US dollars in an aggressive bid to shore up the local currency and also eased  a curb on foreign-buying of long-term bonds to expedite the ringgit's  recovery, brokers said.
The move comes only two days after Bank Negara lifted a levy on vostro  accounts (ringgit accounts required to be held by foreigners in local banks),  one of six measures introduced in February to curb an influx of speculative  foreign cash.
"Monday's lifting of the levy on the vostro accounts had not moved the  ringgit as much as Bank Negara had expected and they are very unhappy about  it," said a broker with a foreign bank.
Instructions to ease foreign buying of long-term bonds were given  verbally, brokers said. Foreigners are still not allowed to buy short-term  bonds.
Brokers said they expected the central bank to lift all restrictions on  inflow of speculative funds gradually.
"The central bank came in aggressively to sell dollars this morning and,  in a rare practice, directly revealed its name to brokers to show it means  business," said the broker.
The central bank sold US dollars in New York late Tuesday, brokers said.
The central bank, according to brokers, must have sold at least 300  million dollars to 400 million dollars to move the ringgit, which edged up to  2.6150 in the morning after hovering at 2.62 earlier.
