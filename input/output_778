Rival Yemeni troops clashed northeast of the city of  Aden on Sunday, in the oil-rich Shabwa province, an official spokesman  reported in Sanaa.
The northern spokesman, quoted by the Qatari news agency QNA, said a  southern brigade had been wiped out as troops loyal to President Ali Abdallah  Saleh fought to seize Ataq, the provincial capital.
The fall of Ataq, some 300 kilometres (180 miles) from Aden, would help  the northern Al-Amaliqa brigade, deployed further to the west in Abyan  province, he said.
Saleh's army is fighting to close the net on the southern stronghold of  Aden, a port city, from three fronts: the west, north and east.
But a southern official, former foreign minister Abdelaziz al-Dali, said  on Radio Monte-Carlo that his side had won back the town of Daleh, 90  kilometres (55 miles) north of Aden.
The north announced the capture of the town of Friday and pushed further  south toward the key southern military base of Al-Anad.
Dali insisted southern troops had rolled back the northern advance to the  former border between the old North and South Yemen, and he dismissed what he  called the northern propaganda.
"The military solution pursued by Sanaa has reached an impasse," he said.
Several army units from the south and north were deployed on opposite  sides of the border after the country was unified in May 1990 as a measure  aimed at bringing the two sides closer. But they were not merged.
Units in the north loyal to Vice President Ali Salem al-Baid, a  southerner, were routed soon after the civil war erupted on May 5.
