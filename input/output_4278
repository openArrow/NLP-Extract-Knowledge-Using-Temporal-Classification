National oil firm Petronas is scouting for a  new partner among US, British and Japanese companies to set up Malaysia's  long-delayed second crude refinery, officials said on Thursday.
The proposed four billion ringgit (1.6 billion) sour crude refinery, with  facilities for processing up to 100,000 barrels per day (bpd), is presently a  joint-venture project between Petronas and United States' Conoco Inc.
"We are looking at several proposals from firms in US, UK and Japan, among  others, to participate in the venture," Petronas president Azizan Zainul  Abidin said. "Once we determine the candidate, we can offer the construction  contracts next year."
Officials said the new partner would be given a 15 percent stake in the  project, with Petronas holding 45 percent and Conoco 40 percent.
Petronas had originally planned to set up the refinery by mid-1996 with a  multi-national consortium, comprising Caltex of the United States, Japan's  Idemitsu, South Korea's Samsung and Taiwan's Chinese Petroleum Corp.
But the foreign companies withdrew from the venture and delayed its  projected completion until mid-1997.
Azizan said the refinery would have a capacity for 100,000 bpd of sour  crude -- a higher sulphur content oil prevalent in the Middle East compared  with the low-sulphur sweet crude found in Malaysia.
"The new refinery is an important component of Petronas' strategy to meet  future requirements against a scenario of a dwindling supply of sweet crude,"  Azizan said.
Officials said products from the second refinery would include liquefied  petroleum gas, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, diesel, asphalt and petroleum  coke.
