Defending champion Steffi Graf reached the  semi-finals of the women's singles at the French open Tuesday when she  defeated Ines Gorrochategui of Argentina 6-4, 6-1.
Graf, who is chasing her fourth French title and fifth consecutive Grand  Slam tournament win, completed her victory in just 66 mins on a sun-baked  Roland Garros centre-court.
The 24-year-old world number-one, who needed on-court treatment early in  the match after some clay got into her eye in the first set, now plays  France's twelfth-seed Mary Pierce for a place in Saturday's final. Pierce  minutes earlier demolished Petra Ritter of Austria 6-0, 6-2.
