A crossbow-toting man was arrested just  before Prime Minister Jean Chretien was to speak at the Convention Centre, the  Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Friday.
The arrest came Thursday after the suspect, Earl Kevin Jans, 29, entered  the center and insisted on a meeting with Chretien, said the police.
Jans was carrying the crossbow and three metal darts.
"He was wandering around with it quite openly - the darts in one hand and  the bow in the other," said RCMP spokesman Eric Turner.
He was later charged of possessing a dangerous weapon in a public place.
Chretien arrived 90 minutes after the arrest.
