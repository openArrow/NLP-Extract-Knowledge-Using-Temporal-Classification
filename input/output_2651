Naga militants beheaded 16 members of a rival  tribe inside a church in a village in eastern India, newspapers reported on  Saturday.
Some 50 Nagas stormed the remote village of Sai Pimol in Manipur state on  May 15. They herded a group of Kuki residents into the church, cut off their  heads and burnt 13 houses before escaping, officials were quoted as saying.
The Times of India said other villagers "found the headless bodies in a  pool of blood." The Hindustan Times said most of the dead were women and  children.
It was the worst massacre in Manipur, a small state bordering Burma, since  Naga militants shot dead 87 Kukis on August 13, 1993, triggering a new round  of tribal violence.
The attackers in both cases belonged to the outlawed National Socialist  Council of Nagaland, which has been fighting for four decades for an  independent Naga homeland in India's rugged north-east.
A bitter feud between the Nagas and members of the Kuki tribe, who have  raised their own armed forces, has claimed hundreds of lives in Manipur in the  past two years.
