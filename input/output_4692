US Masters champion Jose-Maria Olazabal took  a clubhouse lead with a five under par 67 in the opening round of the PGA  Championship here on Friday.
The 28-year-old Spaniard, who had said he had lost the magic of Augusta  and was hitting the ball sideways at times, brought the biggest cheer of the  day when he pitched in from 70 yards for an eagle three at the final hole.
Out on the course, his Ryder Cup team-mate Costantino Rocca was also five  under par with four holes still to play.
And South African Ernie Els, playing with Rocca, was only one behind along  with another Ryder Cup man, Mark James.
Europe number one Colin Montgomerie, playing with Olazabal and James,  could do no better than a two over par 74.
It was the first time the 1991 and 1993 runner-up had gone over par in any  competitive round at the West Course.
Apart from his pitch-in, Olazabal also made a 40-foot putt for a birdie at  the 11th and almost pitched in as well at the 12th.
"I can't complain about 67, but the shots were not as sharp as the score  might suggest," he admitted.
James recorded a 68 in only his fourth appearance of the season and  admitted he still trying to remove rust from his game.
Fellow Scot Sam Torrance was on the same mark, while Ireland's former cup  hero Eamonn Darcy had to withdraw after only four holes because of a trapped  nerve in his back.
Nick Faldo, Seve Ballesteros, Ian Woosnam and defending champion Bernhard  Langer were among the later starters, but Ballesteros began brightly with a  birdie two at the 155-yard second.
