Southern Yemeni troops repelled an assault by  northern tanks on a village near the south's stronghold of Aden on Tuesday, a  correspondent reported.
Two tank crewmen were killed and 12 captured, while a southern civilian   also died and 10 others were injured, according to an Aden television reporter  also at the scene.
A T-54 tank was overturned at the entrance to the village of Waht, 20  kilometres (12 miles) from Aden. Black smoke emerged from three other tanks  outside Waht.
Southern soldiers and militiamen, backed by Mil Mi-8 helicopters, raked  the area with RPG-7 rocket and automatic weapons fire, while northern  artillery on the nearby Sobbeiha mountains provided cover for the retreating  tanks.
Northern forces have opened new fronts in their four-week war to capture  Aden, with fierce fighting around villages northwest of the port city, a  military spokesman and correspondents said.
