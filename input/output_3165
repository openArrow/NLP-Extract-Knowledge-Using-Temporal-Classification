The 1984 murder of Roman Catholic priest, Father  Jerzy Popieluszko, was "planned down to the last detail", former prime  minister Jan Olszewski said Monday.
Olszewski was giving evidence at the trial in Warsaw of two former  communist generals, Wladyslaw Ciaston and Zenon Platek, who are charged with  ordering the killing of the chaplain in the trade union movement Solidarity,  which spearheaded opposition to Communist Party rule.
Olszewski, a lawyer who acted as plaintiff in the 1985 trial of three  secret police officers sentenced to lengthy jail terms for carrying out the  killing, said the liquidation of Popieluszko was designed to "destabilise the  situation" in Poland.
He added the murder was also intended to sow discord within Communist  Party factions and the interior ministry.
The former premier said the names of secret agents involved in the case  would have to be revealed in order to find who really ordered the murder.
Ciaston and Platek, both formerly high-ranking interior ministry  officials, have been under investigation for two years. They deny any  wrongdoing.
Colonel Adam Pietruszka, the direct superior of the three policemen  convicted of the crime, received a 25-year prison sentence in 1985.
