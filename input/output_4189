The father of the confessed assassin of a Mexican  presidential candidate suspects the slaying was the result of a government  plot, his lawyer was quoted as saying in Thursday's New York Times.
Ruben Aburto Cortez said that several weeks before Luis Donaldo Colosio  was killed after a political rally in Tijuana on March 23, his son Mario told  him he had met with a federal security agent, attorney Peter Schay said.
The security agent, Salvador Hernandez Tomassini, was initially implicated  in the assassination but later was cleared. Mario Aburto confessed to shooting  Colosio and is being held in a prison near Mexico City.
The father contends his son was set up by two other security agents who  have been jailed on charges they helped carry out the assassination.
Schay said that Aburto, who lives in the San Pedro suburb of Los Angeles,  did not reveal his son's comments earlier because he feared reprisals against  his relatives in Tijuana.
Mario Aburto's mother, brother and four other relatives crossed illegally  into the United States on Sunday claiming harassment since the assassination.  The are living with Ruben Aburto pending an asylum hearing.
Mexico's Attorney General's office said Wednesday in a statement that no  arrest warrants had been issued for Aburto's relatives.
"These people are not being sought, pressured or harassed by Mexican  authorities," the statement said. "They can return to the country without  fearing to lose their freedom."
Schay said that Aburto's relatives have since told him they might not seek  political asylum because they hope to return to Mexico in three to six months.
