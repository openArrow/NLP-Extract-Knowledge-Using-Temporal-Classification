About 30 wounded people were killed in their beds  when a mortar shell slammed into Kigali's main hospital early Thursday, a  United Nations spokesman said, quoting reports by witnesses.
UN officials were on their way to the hospital to check the report,  spokesman Abdul Kabia said. It was unknown who had fired the mortar shell.
Fierce fighting between rebels and army soldiers erupted overnight around  Kigali airport and prevented a UN relief plane from landing, Kabia said.
Artillery and small arms fire resumed overnight in various parts of  Rwanda's capital, which had been relatively quiet for several days.
UN officials shuttled between rebel and army commanders Wednesday in their  latest attempt to win an agreement to make the airport a UN-controlled neutral  zone.
But a spokesman for the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front said the airport  remained a military target because it was surrounded by government artillery  positions and there was a big army camp nearby.
