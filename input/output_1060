Northern troops on Monday captured the south's main  air base of Al-Anad which controls a key highway leading to the southern  stronghold of Aden, the official Yemeni news agency Saba said.
However, the report was immediately denied by a southern military  spokesman quoted on Aden television. He nevertheless acknowledged that  northern troops had advanced on the facility.
The Saba news agency, run by the north, said Saleh's troops were "mopping  up the last pockets of the rebel forces in Al-Anad base," around 60 kilometres  (35 miles) north of the port city.
"A unit of the (south's) 22nd brigade and around 100 members of the  special guard of Ali Salem al-Baid surrendered to the forces of unity and  legality," it said, quoting military sources.
But a southern military spokesman told Aden television that "fighting is  taking place in the Kirsh-Rahida sector to repel the northern forces,"  referring to an area some 10 kilometres (six miles) from Al-Anad.
Southern military officials have said more than 20,000 soldiers loyal to  Baid, ousted by parliament last week as vice president and bitter rival of  President Ali Abdallah Saleh, were deployed in the base.
