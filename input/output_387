Prime Minister Jean Chretien told members of his  governing Liberal Party he would continue efforts to build Canadian unity  despite the efforts of Quebec separatists.
Describing Canada as "the best country in the world, a country that is the  envy of the world," Chretien's message was seen as a critique of separatists  who want to see his native province of Quebec become an independent state.
Speaking to nearly 3,000 jubilant supporters six months after winning a  landslide election victory he said he would do "what is right for my country,  Canada ... Our challenge is to keep building this country."
Chretien offered no new policy initiatives, even though the convention is  supposedly a policy-making convention.
Instead, he stood firm on patriotic themes and rhetoric before a partisan  crowd which continuously interrupted him with standing ovations. Many  delegates broke into a chorus of the national anthem "O, Canada" when Chretien  ended his speech.
One of the standing ovations came when Chretien told delegates that he had  decided not to allow the United States carry out any more cruise missile tests  over Canadian territory after this year.
The tests began under another Liberal prime minister, Pierre Trudeau.
Once elected, Chretien said he would review the situation, but would allow  two tests already planned for this year.
