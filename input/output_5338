Immigrants have invested a total of 720.5  million NZ dollars (424.3 million US dollars) in New Zealand since new  business-related immigration policies were implemented in November 1991,  Minister of Immigration Roger Maxwell said in a statement Monday.
"The business investment category (BIC) has been successful in attracting  immigrants with business skills and capital to invest in New Zealand," he said.
"There has also been a growing trend for business immigrants to gain  residence through the general category, under which applicants can score  points by investing settlement funds of more than 100,000 dollars.
"Of the total funds invested to date, 434.9 million dollars has been  invested under the general category and 285.6 million dollars under the BIC,"  he said.
Maxwell said that under the BIC policy, investment funds must be  transferred to New Zealand through the trading bank system before a residence  permit can be issued.
Funds must then be retained in New Zealand for a minimum of two years. If  not, the residence permit may be revoked.
