Kurdish rebels killed nine villagers in Edebuk and  set fire to some houses in the eastern region of Erzincan, the Turkish news  agency Anatolia reported on Monday.
The Kurds used machine-gun fire in the attack late on Sunday, the agency  said. Only hours earlier Interior Minister Nahit Mentese had issued a  statement saying that the separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) fighting  the Turkish authorities for a decade was on the point of breaking up after a  series of military defeats.
Police in Istanbul were meanwhile holding a couple suspected of planting a  bomb on the Blue Train at the railway station minutes before its departure for  Ankara overnight. The couple, slightly injured in the blast, had Turkish  nationality, police said.
