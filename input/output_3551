Two airline stewardesses were seriously hurt when a  Turkish plane was forced to make an emergency landing at Prague airport after  a piece of its landing gear fell off in flight, airport authorities said  Tuesday.
The 115 passengers on the DC-8 plane of the Turkish firm Birgen Air, which  was on a charter flight from Paris to Vienna, were not injured in the incident  Monday night, the sources said.
Several tires caught fire as the plane set down but airport firemen  quickly brought the flames under control.
The passengers were all safely evacuated, with some opting for a night  train to Vienna while others were put on regular flights Tuesday.
The airport authorities said the Birgen plane was still at Prague-Ruzyne  airport awaiting repairs.
