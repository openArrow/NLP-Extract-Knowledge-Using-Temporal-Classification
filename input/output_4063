The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  confirmed Wednesday that no plutonium was missing from a Japanese factory  processing nuclear fuel.
Some 70 kilograms (154 pounds) of plutonium, enough to make nine nuclear  bombs, had in fact accumulated as "hold-up" in dust form on exposed surfaces  of processing areas, the IAEA said in a statement.
"The IAEA has been well aware of the presence of this material throughout,  which has been full declared as hold-up by the operator and is measured by the  IAEA on a monthly basis, using a specially-designed system," the statement  said.
In other respects, the Tokai-mura plant northeast of Tokyo was a  highly-automated facility with the most advanced nuclear material accountancy  system in existence, providing information to the IAEA on the movement and  quantities of such material on a near real-time basis, the nuclear watchdog  said.
The plant operators had decided to leave the deposited hold-up where it  was since the plant opened in October 1988 to minimise radiation exposure to  personnel, the IAEA said.
However with a view to improving the quality of the measurements the IAEA  had urged the necessity of collecting the hold-up material and a schedule for  this was currently being worked out with the Japanese authorities, the  statement added.
The Washington-based Nuclear Control Institute, a non-governmental  organisation, said on May 9 that the plant should be closed until the problem  is solved.
NCI president Paul Leventhal said there was no proof that Japan was  diverting plutonium for a weapons program. But he asked the IAEA to closely  monitor the Japanese facility.
A plant spokesman rebutted the demand for the shutdown on May 11, saying,   "There is nothing unclear about what are strictly residuals in the production  process. We have made efforts to reduce them and we will."
Leventhal said the NCI had sent a letter to US Secretary of State Warren  Christopher urging him to take the matter up with Japan as most of the  plutonium being used at the plant came from the United States.
According to press reports, the IAEA was concerned because the instrument  monitoring the amount of plutonium in the production process had a margin of  error between 10 and 15 percent.
It means that for every 70 kilograms of plutonium counted, some eight  kilograms, enough for a nuclear bomb, could have escaped detection.
