The SAS airline Wednesday reported a huge drop  in quarterly losses and said it had abandoned any ideas of merging with  another company.
The airline had reduced pre-tax losses for the first quarter to 101  million kronor (13 million dollars) from 1.534 billion kronor in the first  quarter of last year, the company said.
The new managing director Jan Stenberg said that SAS had abandoned any  idea of merging with another airline because it would be "too complicated and  impossible."
But it would "collaborate with other airlines such as Austrian Airlines,  Swissair, British Midlands, Continental (E-U) and Thai International," he said.
These airlines could sell each other's tickets, he said.
SAS might pull out of some intercontinental routes to North America or  Asia but no decision had yet been taken. "The future of SAS lies in Europe,"  he said.
The Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) increased sales by 3.7 percent to  8.989 billion kronor (1.15 billion dollars) from 8.673 billion kronor, the  company announced.
Operating results before write-downs showed a profit of 345 million kronor  compared to a loss of 158 million kronor.
The board said the results should improve during the year, yielding a  profit, but did not provide figures.
The total number of people employed had been reduced from 38,714 at the  end of the first quarter of last year to 32,497.
In February the group announced a restructuring plan to save about 2.9  billion kronor by the summer of 1995. Under the plan 2,930 employees were to  be laid off.
Half of the company is owned by the Swedish, Norwegian and Danish  governments. The rest is owned by private shareholders in Sweden, Norway and  Denmark.
