Sinn Fein, the political wing of the outlawed IRA,  said Thursday ahead of Anglo-Irish talks here it would only answer Britain's  latest move in Northern Ireland peace efforts after June's European elections.
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams spoke on a BBC radio interview shortly before  Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds and his British counterpart John Major  began discussing how to set up new multi-party talks on Northern Ireland.
The multi-party talks will aim at finding a formula for local rule in the  British province, two years after a last round ended without accord.
Sinn Fein did not take part in the talks that ended in 1992. But it would  be brought into the new round if it agrees to renounce violence. The other  participants are London, Dublin and the Northern Ireland parties.
London and Dublin have been awaiting Sinn Fein's reaction to  clarifications published by London last week on the so-called Anglo-Irish  declaration.
Adams repeated Thursday that the clarifications were "significant" and  that his party would not seek further explanations.
He said his political wing of the Irish Republican Army would meet after  the June 9 European ballot to comment on "the part that the Downing Street  declaration will play in the peace process."
"I am quite convinced that what is going to come out of this peace process  is a peace settlement. It is a significant step," he said.
Irish officials have said an actual talks document might be ready for  presentation at the next Anglo-Irish summit in late June or early July.
The London response last week was a detailed, 21-page answer to one of 20  questions raised by Sinn Fein on the December Anglo-Irish declaration. The  British government said the other 19 were basically invitations to negotiation  and so were not answered.
