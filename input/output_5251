The Houston Rockets survived low  scoring from Hakeem Olajuwon and a determined rally by the Utah Jazz here  Sunday to post an 80-78 win in the National Basketball Association playoff  semi-finals.
The victory gave Houston a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series, with game  five scheduled for Tuesday in Houston.
Houston led from the first quarter, but Utah pulled within two with less  than 14 seconds left thanks to John Stockton's three-pointer.
Utah then got the ball again when Sam Cassell was called for a foul trying  to position himself for the inbounds pass.
But when Utah's Tom Chambers missed his shot, Houston grabbed the rebound  and ran out the clock.
It took longer than it should have, because Utah timekeeper Wayne Hicken  forgot to start the clock.
"I got caught up in the game," he said.
Houston's defense dictated the game, holding Utah to 31 points in the  first half.
Kenny Smith was Houston's only big scorer, with 25 points, as Olajuwon  scored just 16 points while concentrating on guarding Utah's Karl Malone.
Malone scored just four of his 25 points while Olajuwon was marking him.
