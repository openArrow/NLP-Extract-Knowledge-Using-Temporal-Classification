Main women's singles title contenders at this year's  French Open Championships which begin at the Roland Garros Stadium here on  Monday (x-denotes seeded player):
STEFFI GRAF (Germany x1)
A hot favourite to retain her title here and complete a fourth consecutive  'Grand Slam' tournament win. The 24-year-old world number-one has dominated  women's tennis since her great rival Monica Seles was stabbed and forced out  of the game last year. It is difficult to see who can stop Graf on her current  form and prevent her from winning her 15th major title and fourth French  crown. Arantxa Sanchez and Martina Navratilova look to be the main threats but  both will have to play at their very best to score an upset.
Stengths: Forehand and speed
Weaknesses: Hesitates to come to the net to finish points
ARANTXA SANCHEZ (Spain x2)
Roland Garros has been a happy hunting ground for the 22-year-old Sanchez,  whose brothers Emilio and Javier will be playing in the men's event. The  Barcelona player won the title in 1989 and has since reached one final and two  semi-finals since. This will be her eighth appearance at Roland Garros.
Strengths: Determination and drop shots
Weaknesses: Overconfidence
CONCHITA MARTINEZ (Spain x3)
Unlike the other top-ranked women players, Martinez, who was 22 last  month, could probably walk unrecognised through a shopping centre. But she has  one of the most effective clay-court games in women's tennis. In her six  previous visits to Roland Garros she has reached the quarter-finals five  times. This year she hopes her wristy baseline top-spin will take her further.  Her confidence was boosted in 1993 when she was a surprise semi-finalist on  only her second visit to Wimbledon.
Strengths: Baseline accuracy and patience
Weaknesses: Lacks variation
