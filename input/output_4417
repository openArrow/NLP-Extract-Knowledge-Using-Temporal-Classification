The United States will begin broadcasting  programs on Chinese television and increase its Voice of America (VOA) radio  broadcasts, it was announced Thursday.
"The administration will step up efforts to ensure that the Chinese people  are fully informed about the developments in China and throughout the world,"  said a statement from White House.
The announcement followed an agreement between Washington and Beijing to  resolve US complaints about jamming VOA broadcasts, an area President Bill  Clinton had targeted as a condition for renewal of China's most favored nation  (MFN) trade status, which he extended Thursday.
"If the result of this agreement is unimpeded broadcasts by VOA that  doesn't result in frequency interruption, that would certainly be a step  forward in bringing Voice of America broadcasts to the people of China, and  that would constitute progress," State Department spokesman Michael McCurry  said earlier.
The White House said that the television broadcasts via satellite would  report on political developments in China.
China had long denied US complaints that it was jamming VOA broadcasts  into China but eased its position somewhat earlier this year by agreeing to  allow a US team to visit to discuss possible technical problems.
As a result of the visit which ended Thursday the two sides had determined  that VOA and a domestic station were broadcasting on the same station, and  agreed to move VOA to another frequency which was not being used by anyone  else, McCurry said.
"There should be non-interfered broadcasts" in the future, McCurry said.
But he refused to comment on whether the two sides had established that  jamming was taking place, saying simply that "the problem that the two sides  agreed to address was a problem of entangled frequencies."
McCurry said that no date had been set for putting VOA on a clear  frequency, and that more talks would be held to finalize technical details.
