The dollar was marginally higher against the yen in  early trading on Monday after the bank of Japan had intervened overnight to  buy dollars for yen, slowing the rise of the Japanese currency, dealers said.
By midmorning, the dollar climbed to 104.18 yen from 103.88 at the close  on Friday, but was weaker against the mark at 1.6435 marks from 1.6495.
At the IBJ Internataional bank analyst Keith Edmonds said that the dollar  should remain stable during the day as several European markets, including the  market in Paris, were closed for the Penticost holiday.
"One of the main factors likely to move the market is the defeat of the  CDU candidate at today's German presidential elections," he said.
Edmonds said the defeat of the candidate from the Christian Democratic  Union CDU. which is headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl within the coalition  government, could be taken as a sign that the opposition socialist SPD would  win the legislative elections in October 16, thus putting the mark under  pressure.
European currencies remained generally stable around the closing levels on  Friday at 3.4180 French francs to the mark from 3.4179 on Friday and at 962.75  lire to the mark from 961.10.
Against the drachma, which has been under pressure recently, the mark  declined slightly to 149.60 drachmas from 153.35.
The Greek economics minister Yannos Papantoniou on Friday evening denied  rumours that a devaluation of the drachma was likely after the Greek currency  had fallen below 150 drachmas to the mark for the first time ever.
By mid morning the dollar was being traded at 1.6435 marks from 1.6495 at  the close on Friday, at 104.18 yen against 103.88, at 1.4048 Swiss francs  against 1.4040 and at 5.6238 French francs against 5.6288.
Sterling was at 1.5092 dollars from 1.5075, at 2.4804 marks from 2.4866,  at 157.31 yen from 156.60, at 2.1212 Swiss francs from 2.1165 and at 8.4919  French francs from 8.4929.
