The opposition coalition Accord for Russia has  postponed its founding congress to May 28 due to a lack of funds and  organisational problems, a spokesman for the movement said Thursday.
The congress, which was scheduled to be held Thursday, was to unite  communists and conservatives in parliament as well as opposition leader  Alexander Rutskoi in a new front opposed to President Boris Yeltsin.
Spokesman Sergei Obukhov told AFP that founders of the movement required  time to raise money and make travel arrangements for representatives from the  regions who were to attend the congress in Moscow.
The postponement came amid rumors of dissension among leaders of Accord  for Russia, in particular between Rutskoi and communist leader Gennady  Zyuganov who has been hesitant to give the former vice president his full  backing.
Ruskoi meanwhile told AFP that he would hold a one-day congress of his  political party called "Free Russia" on Saturday.
