Six Malaysians were hanged here Friday for drug  trafficking, Singapore's Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) said.
The six, convicted of trafficking cannabis and heroin and helping others  to do so, went to the gallows at Singapore's Changi Prison at dawn.
Under local laws, the death sentence is mandatory for those convicted of  trafficking more than 15 grams of heroin, 500 grams of cannabis or abetting in  such offences.
Almost similar laws are enforced in Malaysia.
The CNB said that the hangings raised to 59 the number of people executed  for drug-related offences under Singapore's Misuse of Drugs Act which   introduced the death penalty for trafficking in 1975.
