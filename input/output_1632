NATO warplanes kept watch over the besieged  Bosnian enclave of Tuzla on Wednesday as the UN Protection Force scheduled  three fresh flights to ferry in radar equipment a day after Bosnian Serb  artillery hit the airport when a first UNPROFOR plane landed.
Leopard tanks manned by Scandinavian troops were also on alert in the  Moslem city in north-east Bosnia where there have been no flights for a month.
Outlining the precautionary measures, UNPROFOR spokesman Rob Annink  refused to say whether the warplanes would take retaliatory action if there  was more Serb shelling. "To use close air support is a big step," he remarked.
"The international community has not allowed it yet."
When Tuesday's shooting occurred, a NATO plane was at hand and procedures  to call it into action were put in motion, Major Annink said.
But Lieutenant-general Michael Rose, UNPROFOR military chief in Bosnia,  and Yasushi Akashi, special envoy of UN secretary-general Boutros  Boutros-Ghali "made the decision not to request air support," Annink added.
Nine hits were registered on the airport, he said. The Serbs said they had  received no advance notice of the plane's arrival. Their forces surround the  airport, which is Moslem-held. For Wednesday's flights, the Serbs had been  duly informed, Annink said.
The three planes were bringing in American-made radar which could provide  more detailed information about how many shells landed and where they were  fired from. Such data could "make a political reaction possible," the  spokesman noted.
Five radars were supposed to be set up in the Tuzla region. Their presence  would secure the airbase and the Posavina corridor in the northern region  around Brcko. Bosnian government forces have been harrying the Serbs at Brcko  in recent weeks.
