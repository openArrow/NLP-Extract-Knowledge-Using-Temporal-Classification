Former junior champion Anna Smashnova, who caused a  major upset by putting Jana Novotna out of the French Open on Tuesday, failed  to clear the second hurdle here on Thursday.
The 17-year-old Minsk-born Israeli was overwhelmed by experienced American  Shaun Stafford 4-6, 1-6 who now faces either compatriot Ann Grossman or Petra  Langrova of the Czech Republic for a place in the last sixteen.
Nothing went right for Smashnova, who was almost defaulted for being late  on court. She arrived just in time.
Smashnova's top-spin baseline game and normally effective rolling  backhands which had destroyed the fifth seed in the first round, cut little  ice with the no-nonsense power tennis of the 25-year-old Florida player.
Stafford, who came armed with enormous sunglasses against fierce early  sunshine, attacked anything short with gusto and whereas Smashnova had serious  problems with her serve, the 6ft Stafford conceded only one point on her  service games as she raced 5-1 clear.
The 5ft 2in Israeli, ranked 100th in the world, staged a plucky recovery  but it was not enough. And once the Florida player had taken the first set,  there was no doubt about the outcome.
As thousands of fans were still streaming through the gates of the Stadium  second-seed Michael Stich was having a nightmare on centre-court.
The German, looking increasingly unhappy and with the skies becoming  increasingly threatening, was trailing the 33rd ranked Aaron Krickstein of the  United States by two sets to love.
The 1989 champion Michael Chang, seeded eighth, was also involved in a  tough struggle on the number-one show court where he was level at one-set all  with Jordi Arrese of Spain.
