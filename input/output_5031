Former French premier Edith Cresson on Saturday  defended Didier Pineau-Valencienne, the leading industrialist arrested on  charges of fraud Friday, saying he was "extremely respectable."
In an interview with Journal Du Dimanche, Cresson said Pineau-Valencienne,  head of Schneider SA, had "a strong sense of duty and national interest,"  adding she was "sure he will know how to defend himself."
"He can count on very wide support in France and abroad ... there is a  substantial amount of sympathy for him," said Cresson, who worked at Schneider  before becoming French premier briefly in 1991.
Pineau-Valencienne was charged with fraud and taken into custody at dawn  Friday in Brussels. He was arrested after being quizzed by investigators for  more than 20 hours, having travelled to the Belgian capital voluntarily  Thursday to answer questions.
Belgian television RTBF reported that French Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur contacted his Belgian counterpart, Jean-Luc Dehaene, shortly after  Pineau-Valencienne's arrest.
Under Belgian law, Pinneau-Valencienne could be held in temporary custody  for five days, until Wednesday, when he must appear before a judge.
Cresson said "it will certainly be a very tough test for him," but  insisted that "he will know how to defend himself ... he is a very strong  person ... he is very rigorous with himself and with others."
Schneider is the 16th-biggest French industrial group and the world leader  in industrial electrical installations.
Pineau-Valencienne was holding up well in prison, according to his younger  brother Arnaud, who visited him Saturday for half an hour.
Arnaud Pineau-Valencienne told the Belgian radio station RTBF his brother  had been "extremely surprised" at his arrest, but bore no hard feelings.
