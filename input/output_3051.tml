<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><TimeML><TIMEX3 tid="t0" functionInDocument="CREATION_TIME"/>Four candidates from across the political spectrum  will <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="FUTURE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">find</EVENT> out if their presidential ambitions have <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">borne</EVENT> fruit <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE">Monday</TIMEX3> when a  special electoral college of deputies votes here to <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">decide</EVENT> Germany's next head  of state.&#13;
The special 1,324-strong assembly, which only <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">meets</EVENT> once every <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION">five years</TIMEX3>  for presidential elections, <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">comprises</EVENT> the 662 federal members of parliament  and an equal number of party-chosen delegates from the 16 regional  legislatures.&#13;
Their choice for the largely honorary post will <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="FUTURE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">rest</EVENT> between conservative  Roman Herzog, Social Democrat Johannes Rau -- favourite and main challenger  respectively -- Free Democrat Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher, and non-aligned  outsider Jens Reich.&#13;
Whoever is <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">elected</EVENT> to the post will <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="FUTURE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">face</EVENT> the difficult task of <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">succeeding</EVENT>  Richard von Weizsaecker, who has arguably <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">become</EVENT> Germany's most popular  political figure in his <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION">10 years</TIMEX3> as incumbent.&#13;
Although the presidency, which <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">switched</EVENT> its headquarters from Bonn to  Berlin in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE">January</TIMEX3>, <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">fulfills</EVENT> a largely honorary function comparable to that of  the British monarchy, Von Weizsaecker <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">wielded</EVENT> considerable influence during  his <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION">10-year</TIMEX3> tenure.&#13;
<EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">Showing</EVENT> his compatriots by example a means of <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">combining</EVENT> national pride  with the respect for moral imperatives <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">dictated</EVENT> by Germany's Nazi past, he  <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">rose</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">become</EVENT> the embodiment of his country's conscience.&#13;
The election could also <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="could">prove</EVENT> a watershed for Chancellor Helmut Kohl,  whose personal popularity rating has <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">sunk</EVENT> after 12 years in power.&#13;
<EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">Should</EVENT> his candidate -- Herzog -- <EVENT eid="e22" class="I_ACTION" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">fail</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">win</EVENT>, Kohl's capacity for  <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">conserving</EVENT> authority among his governing coalition will be <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="FUTURE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">undermined</EVENT>,  analysts <EVENT eid="e26" class="REPORTING" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">say</EVENT>, just <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION">five months</TIMEX3> ahead of crucial legislative elections.&#13;
Under the college's election system, the winner <EVENT eid="e27" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">requires</EVENT> an absolute  majority in either the first or second round of balloting.&#13;
If the poll <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">goes</EVENT> to a third round, the candidate with the highest number  of votes will be <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="FUTURE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">elected</EVENT>.&#13;
The pre-poll favourite, 60-year-old Herzog, is the most conservative of  the four.&#13;
A member of the Christian Democrat Union (CDU) since <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE">1970</TIMEX3>, he has a  reputation for <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">enjoying</EVENT> the good life.&#13;
A lawyer by training, he has been president of Germany's constitutional  court since <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE">November 1987</TIMEX3>.&#13;
His closest challenger is <EVENT eid="e31" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">expected</EVENT> to be Rau -- the candidate who opinion  polls <EVENT eid="e32" class="REPORTING" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">say</EVENT> the man and woman in the street would <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="would">vote</EVENT> for if they had the  chance.&#13;
Prime minister of Germany's most important and densely-populated state of  North Rhine-Westphalia since <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE">1978</TIMEX3>, the avuncular Rau, aged 63, is also  well-liked within his Social Democrat Party (SPD).&#13;
Rau <EVENT eid="e34" class="REPORTING" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">says</EVENT> he would "reconcile rather than divide". But the present balance  of party votes is against him.&#13;
Hamm-Bruecher, meanwhile, could at the age of 73 be <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">dismissed</EVENT> as too old  for the job.&#13;
But not content to <EVENT eid="e36" class="STATE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="NEG" modality="none">remain</EVENT> simply the "Grand Lady of the Liberals," this  former junior foreign minister has an iron will and is one of the independent  thinkers on the left wing of the Free Democrat Party (FDP).&#13;
The fourth candidate, easterner Jens Reich, 55, is the joker in the pack.&#13;
Although a serious political challenger, unlike his rivals he is not  <EVENT eid="e37" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="NEG" modality="none">backed</EVENT> by one of the three main parties of government and thus has no chance  of being <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">elected</EVENT>.&#13;
