China has dismissed a report by a US human rights  group that hundreds of previously unknown prisoners arrested after the 1989  pro-democracy crackdown are serving lengthy jail terms.
"This is a sheer fabrication," a foreign ministry spokesman was quoted as  saying by the official Xinhua news agency late Saturday.
The 60-page report, released Thursday by Human Rights Watch/Asia,  documents almost 500 cases in Beijing alone of previously unrecorded sentences  in the aftermath of the June 4 Tiananmen Square massacre.
More than 200 are still in two correctional facilities run by the Beijing  authorities -- Beijing No.2 Prison and Qinghe Farm -- performing hard labour  and often subject to torture and other abuses, the report said.
Human Rights Watch/Asia has a "deep hostility towards China", the  spokesman said, accusing the watchdog of fabricating "similar rumours" on the  human rights issue in the past.
In an obvious reference to the ongoing Sino-US row over China's  most-favoured-nation (MFN) trading status, the spokesman said the report was  released "out of ulterior motives".
The report is likely to place further pressure on President Bill Clinton,  who must decide by June 3 whether to renew China's MFN with the United States.
Clinton has said significant progress in human rights was a precondition  for renewing China's trade privileges.
