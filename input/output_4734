If Andrei Medvedev had any doubts about his fitness,  they were answered at the French Open here on Friday when he had to fight his  way through five gruelling sets to beat Canadian Greg Rusedski.
The 19-year-old Ukranian, who was out of tennis for three months after a  knee operation earlier this year, finally scored a 2-6, 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 win  in jusat under three hours.
He came to Paris as one of the favourites to win the crown after victories  at the Monte Carlo Open and Hamburg, and he will now play Jacco Eltingh of the  Netherlands for a place in the last-eight.
Eltingh defeated Czech Daniel Vacek in straight-sets.
"I feel totally exhausted," admitted the fourth-seeded Medvedev, who was a  semi-finalist twelve months ago.
"The competition is so high here this year."
