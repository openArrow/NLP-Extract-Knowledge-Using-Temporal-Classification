Russia's new military posture is purely defensive  and not aimed at any other state, Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said  here Tuesday.
He was speaking after a meeting with defence ministers of the North  Atlantic Treaty Organisation to explain Russia's long-awaited military  doctrine to replace the security blueprint of the defunct Soviet Union.
But Grachev said Russia would continue to use its nuclear weapons "as a  means of deterrence against a large-scale nuclear war."
He said Russia might use its nuclear weapons against countries with  nuclear arsenals of their own, and perhaps against non-nuclear aggressor  countries, whether or not they were in coalition with nuclear states.
Before his arrival, the ministers said NATO had reaffirmed the essential  role of nuclear forces "including sub-strategic forces widely deployed in  Europe at the minimum level necessary to preserve peace and stability."
But in a statement, the NATO ministers welcomed the fact that Russia, the  United States and Britain had nearly completed steps to "de-target" strategic  nuclear weapons pointed at each other.
"We expressed satisfaction with this important gesture marking the  improved strategic climate between former Cold War adversaries," the statement  said.
