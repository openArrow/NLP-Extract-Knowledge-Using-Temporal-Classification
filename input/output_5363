A team of three European Union ministers arrived  here Monday for meetings with President Liamine Zeroual and other top  officials in conflict-wracked Algeria.
Officials said the three were met at the airport by Algerian Foreign  Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri, with whom they were to have talks at the outset  of a working visit of several hours.
The team, consisting of Belgian Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister Willy  Claes and Greek and German Deputy Foreign Ministers Georges Papandreou and  Dieter Kastrup, was also to meet Algerian Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi and top  finance officials over lunch.
Their task was to assess the political and economic situation in Algeria  and report back to the European Union with regard to the provision of credit  facilities, officials said.
A diplomatic source said the visit was a "signal of European support for  Algeria's economic reform programme."
The country has been plunged into war between Moslem extremist guerrillas  and the security forces since the cancellation in January 1992 of the second  round of a general election the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS)  was poised to win.
The conflict has claimed more than 3,000 lives and seen foreign workers  and residents and Algerian intellectuals targetted in a wave of terrorist  attacks.
The three European ministers were due to give a press conference following  their meetings here.
