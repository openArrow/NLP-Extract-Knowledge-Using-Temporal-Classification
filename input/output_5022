The synod of the Serbian Orthodox church is to  award its highest honour, the Saint Sava medal, to Russian writer Alexander  Solzhenitsyn, who returned to Russia on Friday after 20 years in exile, the  Tanjug news agency reported Saturday.
"Alexander Solzhenitsyn is a witness, chosen by God, who has given a voice  to millions of innocent victims of Soviet gulags," said the synod in a  statement, recalling that some of the Soviet prison camps were built on  Yugoslav islands.
It said the writer had "understood not only the inhumanity of the  totalitarian Soviet system but also the totalitarian nature of western  consumer society and its new world order."
The statement hailed the 75-year-old author of the Gulag Archipelago  Solzhenitsyn as a prophet whose return home evoked hope "not just for Russians  and Russia."
