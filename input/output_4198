Rwandan rebels pressed their offensive to capture  the capital Kigali Thursday as a UN special envoy sought to persuade them to  accept a ceasefire already agreed by government forces, relief officials and  diplomats said.
The rebels pounded Kigali with artillery and mortar fire shortly after the  UN envoy, Iqbal Riza, left the embattled capital Thursday to meet rebel  leaders in their northern stronghold of Mulindi, relief officials said.
The rebels reportedly advanced further against battered and demoralised  government forces to capture another key eastern district near Kigali's  airport, which they took from the army Sunday, the officials said.
Riza is trying to negotiate a ceasefire to allow the United Nations to  deploy 5,500 peacekeepers in Rwanda, where 200,000 to 500,000 people have been  slaughtered in relentless attacks by pro-government militiamen against  minority Tutsis and Hutu opposition supporters.
Diplomats in the region said the government had agreed to a ceasefire but  the mainly Tutsi rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) was unlikely to do so  because a military victory was within sight.
The rebels have said they want to seize control of as much of Rwanda as  possible to staunch the bloodbath, and seem anxious that UN peacekeepers might  arrive before they have had time to rout the army, the diplomats said.
"The success of Riza's mission hangs on the RPF's acceptance of a  ceasefire," a senior Western diplomat told AFP.
"It will be difficult for the UN to achieve much here unless both sides  stop fighting," said the diplomat, who requested anonymity.
Riza met rebel leader Paul Kagame in Mulindi on Monday, but failed to  persuade him to drop his demand for the United Nations to cut the size of its  planned force from 5,500 to 2,500.
On Tuesday Riza went to Kigali for talks with army chief of staff Augustin  Bizimungu, followed by talks with members of the self-proclaimed all-Hutu  interim government at its refuge in Gitarama, 40 kilometres (25 miles)  southwest of the capital.
The government and army accepted his proposals for a ceasefire, according  to the diplomats.
But even if the RPF also goes along, the future of the proposed UN  peacekeeping mission is still uncertain.
Western countries, shaken by the world body's failure to end anarchy in  Somalia despite heavy losses among foreign peacekeepers there, are reluctant  to commit troops to another perilous African venture, diplomats said.
UN Secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Wednesday complained that  the the world had turned its back on the "genocide" in Rwanda.
"Let's recognise that it is a failure not only for the UN but also for the  international community," he told a news conference at UN headquarters in New  York. "All of us are responsible for this failure."
"Unless we have the support of the member-states, we will not be able to  obtain the troops which we need on the ground," he said.
The UN Human Rights Commission has appointed a lawyer from Ivory Coast to  investigate the bloodletting, in which civilians have been systematically  hacked, clubbed, burned and shot to death, according to witnesses.
Pregnant women have had their stomachs slit open and been left to bleed to  death.
Militiamen have hacked children to death with machetes in a horrific  bloodbath that is still spilling on, six weeks after president Juvenal  Habyarimana's death in an alleged April 6 rocket attack on his plane plunged  Rwanda into madness, mayhem and massacres.
A handful of foreign doctors are toiling day and night in Kigali to help  the wounded and sick.
But food is running short, and aid officials say there will be serious  malnutrition within 10 days unless something is done.
Fighting has repeatedly prevented UN planes laden with food and medicine  from landing at Kigali airport.
The UN again suspended flights Wednesday after a bullet hole was found in  a C-130 on its return from Kigali.
It was unsure whether the aircraft would be ready to resume its  twice-daily mercy run from Nairobi by Friday, officials said.
