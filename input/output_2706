Ball tampering has been practiced by all England's  leading bowlers for at least 20 years, according to legendary all-rounder  Imran Khan.
But the former Pakistani captain says the whole controversy could have     been settled long ago, had it not been for dithering by the International  Cricket Council and the Test and County Cricket Board, who have allowed the  issue to get out of control.
Imran, interviewed in The Sun newspaper on Saturday, said he watched  senior county bowlers lift the seam of the ball after he arrived in England as  a teenager, and copied them because it was seen as accepted practice.
He said: "The biggest names in English cricket have all done it. And when  I say big names, I mean as big as you can get.
"I don't want to name names because that would be like condemning people,  and they would get very defensive in the current climate.
"I have seen it with my own eyes. And I've seen players on TV lifting the  seam as they walk back to their mark. It is foolish nonsense to say it doesn't  go on."
According to Imran, many bowlers claim they are cleaning mud from the ball  as an excuse for lifting and scratching, but he says: "It is only when an  outside agent, such as Vaseline to shine the ball or a bottle top to scratch  it, is introduced that I regard it as cheating."
It was Imran's revelation in his biography that he used a bottle top to  scratch the ball while playing for Sussex in 1991 that re-ignited the  ball-tampering controversy.
He says in the Sun article: "It was little more than a schoolboyish prank.
"The Sussex players had a good laugh about it. But from the hysteria,  you'd have thought I'd robbed the Bank of England or murdered somebody.
"However, I did feel I should resign my position as an ICC delegate, which  was no great hardship."
