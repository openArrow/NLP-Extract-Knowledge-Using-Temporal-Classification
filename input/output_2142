Former Italian premier Bettino Craxi, who was told  to surrender his passport pending corruption enquiries, is in a Tunis hospital  for treatment of diabetes and needs more rest, friends said Thursday.
His wife Anna had revealed in an interview published by the Turin  newspaper La Stampa Thursday that the missing former Socialist leader was in  Tunisia for treatment.
The whereabouts of the discredited ex-premier, who must answer for some 20  graft allegations, had been uncertain since investigating magistrates demanded  last week that he turn over his passport.
Friends said he was in a clinic where he was being attended by three  specialists, including a cardiologist and a diabetes specialist. "He  absolutely needs rest at least until the end of the week", they said.
His wife Anna told La Stampa that he was "certainly not a man to flee."  The couple have a home in Hammamet on the Tunisian coast, where Anna Craxi has  been living lately.
"I hope that he will be able to return home in Hammamet before the end of  next week. After that, we'll see," she said.
She said examinations by his Tunis doctors found that the 60-year-old  Craxi had suffered a heart attack two years ago.
Last week Milan magistrates heading the so-called "clean hands" corruption  probe that has decimated Italy's former political and business elite ordered  the former Socialist Party leader to turn over his passport so he would not  flee the country or face an international arrest warrant.
His wife said in the interview her husband "was the victim of a colossal  injustice."
