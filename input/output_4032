Unions representing thousands of BBC technicians  and journalists decided Wednesday to call off a series of 24-hour strikes over  pay and hours, officials said.
Union officials agreed to meet BBC managers Thursday.
After a first 24-hour strike Tuesday, the unions were planning to call an  identical stoppage Friday.
Tuesday's strike, the first at the BBC since 1989, was supported by almost  all the 11,000 BBC members of the National Union of Journalists and the  Broadcasting Entertainment Cinematograph and Theatre Union -- almost half of  the corporation's staff, it was reported.
But despite severe disruption of news and current affairs coverage on  television and radio, a combination of repeats and news bulletins prepared by  managers prevented screens going blank.
The unions had promised two strikes each week until their demands are met.
They have been protesting over a new employment package the corporation is  seeking to introduce aimed at improving competitiveness, which includes  performance-related pay.
