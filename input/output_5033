Former US Open and PGA Champion  Julius Boros, 74, died Saturday after collapsing on a golf course.
Ron Sharpe, director of golf at the Coral Ridge Country Club, said a club  member alerted officials there that someone had passed out while driving a  golf cart on the course.
"An assistant went out, and he had obviously died at the time," Sharpe  said. "He has had a bad heart for a long time. I don't know if he had a stroke  or a heart attack."
Boros won the US Open in 1952 and 1963 and won the PGA Championship in  1968. After a US PGA Tour career that included 18 victories, Boros joined the  Senior Tour in 1980. He was inducted in the the PGA Hall of Fame in 1975 and  the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1982.
Boros' son, Guy, was playing in the US tour event in Fort Worth, Texas,  this weekend.
