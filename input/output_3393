A man killed Saturday night in a loyalist attack on  a Dublin pub was a member of the Irish Republican Army, the outlawed  republican organisation said Monday in a call to a Dublin radio station.
The Dublin Brigade of the IRA said Martin Doherty, 35, a father of two  from Ballymun, Dublin, was a volunteer.
Doherty was shot three times when he challenged two gunmen as they tried  to place an 18 pound bomb in a packed Dublin pub during a ballad meeting  attended by sympathisers of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing.
Another man was seriously injured.
The outlawed Protestant loyalist organisation the Ulster Volunteer Force,  earlier issued a statement claiming responsibility for Saturday's attack.
