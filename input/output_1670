South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo denied  Wednesday that the new democratic government was contemplating sending troops  to strife-torn Rwanda to join a UN peacekeeping force.
A statement from Nzo's office said media reports stating that South Africa  has drawn up plans to participate in the UN force were "without foundation."
On Tuesday, foreign ministry spokesman Roland Darroll said documents had  been drawn up for South Africa's participation, and these had been submitted  to the political leadership for consideration.
Another foreign affairs spokesman, Jacques Malan, confirmed that plans had  been compiled, but this was only to outline the options to President Nelson  Mandela's cabinet.
Malan said it was a "little bit premature" to say South Africa already had  concrete plans to commit troops to the tiny east African nation.
South Africa's white minority government, which handed over power after  the African National Congress swept the April 26-29 historic all-race  election, has been excluded from UN operations since being suspended by the  world body in 1974.
The UN Security Council approved Tuesday the staged deployment of 5,500  troops in the strife-torn central African country.
The foreign ministry statement said South Africa was "extremely concerned  by the carnage in recent weeks in Rwanda."
"It (the government) will consult closely with other African countries and  the United Nations before any decision is taken on possible support for any  peacekeeping initiatives," the statement said.
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said in Bonn on Wednesday that half a  million people had been killed in the ethnic slaughter that followed the April  6 death of Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana in a suspicious plane crash.
