Cuban officials used megaphones to plead with more  than 100 asylum-seekers to leave the Belgian ambassador's residence where they  have been holed up since Saturday.
As diplomatic negotiations continued, the officials came to a police line  and shouted into the compound with megaphones, assuring the asylum seekers  they could make formal requests to leave the country and that no reprisals  would be taken.
A total of 113 remained of the 114 who broke into the ambassador's  residence Saturday. One left early Monday.
Belgian Ambassador Paul Veirmeirsch and Serafin Rodriguez of the Cuban  foreign ministry's Europe section exchanged notes on the matter in an effort  to reach a solution to the standoff, according to the official news agency  Prensa Latina.
In Brussels, a Belgian foreign ministry spokesman said Monday the Belgian  government had won "verbal guarantees" from the Cuban authorities that  asylum-seeking Cubans would not be prosecuted.
On Sunday, Cuba's state-run television blamed Florida-based anti-Castro  radio stations and the US government for the occupation of the building. The  United States routinely grants political asylum to Cubans who request it after  reaching US shores -- a policy Cuba has blamed for encouraging emigrants'  risky trips in unseaworthy vessels.
