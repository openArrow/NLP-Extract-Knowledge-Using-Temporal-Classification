Victims struck by pellets outside his country villa north of Buenos Aires,  then complained to police, and a court confiscated his passport.
Accusations of drug trafficking by a former bodyguard in Italy, have  further besmirched his name, but his ability with a ball is still sublime.
And though his weight goes up and down more dramatically than a desert  thermometer, he still has full use of a gift from the gods -- his legendary  left foot.
But the devastating acceleration, perhaps most obviously displayed by his  second goal in the 2-1 win over England in the 1986 World Cup quarter-final,  has gone forever.
Mostly without Maradona, Argentina compiled an impressive run of 31  matches without defeat over a two and a half year period running up to the  qualifying campaign.
But the limitations of Basile's squad was demonstrated when Colombia beat  them 2-1 in the first group match. The talented Columbians then added insult  to injury by thrashing them 5-0 at home -- obliging Basile's men to play off  with Australia for a place in the finals.
Basile is likely to call on six players from the last World Cup squad --  Sergio Goycochea, Ruggeri, midfielders Maradona and Jose Basualdo, plus  forwards Caniggia and Abel Balbo.
His best team seems to be Goycochea in goal, with a defence of Hernan  Diaz, Jorge Borelli, Ruggeri, and Carlos MacAllister. Dario Franco, Fernando  Redondo, Diego Simeone and Maradona would feed front men Caniggia and Gabriel  Batistuta.
