The West should help stem the rise of Islamic  fundamentalism in North Africa by helping "eliminate the economic, social and  political situations" giving rise to it, a report published here Friday said.
The civil affairs commission of the parliamentary assembly of NATO called  on the West to "conduct a generous economic policy, open to imports" from the  north African countries.
Comprising parliamentary deputies from the North Atlantic Treaty  Organisation 16 member states, the assembly is a purely consultative body  without any executive powers.
"While it does not appear desirable to allow the Islamic fundamentalists  to come to power, sustaining the repressive policy currently being operated in  most countries in north Africa does not seem a more viable option," the author  of the report, Pedro Moya, said.
The West must "encourage a policy of cautious democratisation" in these  countries "since only political pluralism will allow the opposition to express  its ideas in a peaceful fashion and in line with the law," the commission said.
Different commissions were meeting in Oslo until Monday.
