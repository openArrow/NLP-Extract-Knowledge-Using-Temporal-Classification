Hong Kong stock prices soared 4.78 percent in  active trading Wednesday as investors went on a buying frenzy confident that  there would be no more further US interest rate hikes in the next few months.
The blue-chip Hang Seng Index gained 431.94 points to close with the  second largest single-day gains so far this year at 9,476.64 -- its highest  level in five weeks.
Turnover amounted to 6.708 billion Hong Kong dollars (860 million US) --  its largest in more than two months and up from the previous day's 4.884  billion dollars.
Brokers said investor sentiment was mainly boosted by the announcement  over the resumption of Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's new airport project,  after discounting US central bank decision to raise its interest rates.
"Investors were expecting no more further changes in the US interest rates  in next few months," said Gillian Kong, analyst at the Sun Hung Kai Securities.
"The uncertainty has been lifted," she said.
After losing 2.26 percent in Tuesday's trading, the index recovered  sharply after US Federal Reserve Board decided to raise the overnight  interbank rate half a percentage point from 3.75 percent to 4.25 percent and  its discount rate from 3.0 percent to 3.5 percent -- the fourth rise in the  overnight rate since February, and the first for discount rate in five years.
Buying was mostly generated domestically as US and European investors  retreated, said Kong, after China and Britain decided to meet Friday to  discuss the financing plans of Hong Kong's multi-billion dollar new airport  project after a lapse of more than nine months.
