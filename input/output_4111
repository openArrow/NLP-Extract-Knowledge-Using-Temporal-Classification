Nearly two-thirds of Tokyo residents are against an  increase in the number of foreigners living in the city, according to a survey  published Thursday by the Mainichi daily.
Questioning 3,000 people, it found that 64 percent of the respondents were  against any rise in the number of foreigners in their neighbourhood, and 28  percent were in favour.
Only one percent of the Japanese population are foreigners, but they are  often viewed in the popular mind as a source of crime and unrest.
