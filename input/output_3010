Greek demonstrators Sunday demanded recognition  from Turkey of the "genocide" of some 350,000 "Pontios" Greeks living under  Turkish rule between 1916 and 1924.
Several hundred people gathered outside the Turkish embassy, shouting  "Turkish killers" and demanding that Turkey admit the massacre of over 40  percent of the 750,000-strong community which lived in Pont-Euxin on the Black  Sea, during and shortly after World War I.
Riot police stepped in to force the protestors back.
Demonstrators placed a wreath in memory of the victims at the monument to  the unknown soldier at the Syndagma Square in central Athens. A mass was held  in the city's cathedral to commemorate victims of the massacre.
The Greek parliament in February announced a "national day of  commemmoration for the genocide." The motion was condemned by the Greek  Communists for its nationalist overtones.
Thousands of the Pontios Greeks have resettled in Greece in the last few  years after the majority of the community emigrated to the Soviet Union in the  years immediately after 1924.
