South Africa must address the huge gap in  living standards between blacks and whites if the country hopes to succeed in  the post-apartheid era, according to a UN report released Wednesday.
"These are not just two different peoples. These are almost two different  continents," said the report issued by the United Nations Development Program  (UNDP).
South Africa ranks 93rd on the Human Development Report 1994's index which  tracks life expectancy, education and consumer buying power.
But whites in the country alone would rank 24th, while blacks alone would  rank 123rd.
"The major challenge for policy makers will be to promote social  integration without provoking racial violence," warned the report prepared by  independent researchers.
The report also notes enormous regional gaps in standards of living and   cites Nigeria, where the state of Bendel ranks alongside progressive Sri  Lanka, while the state of Borno has a life expectancy of only 40 years and a  12 percent literacy rate.
And despite social spending in China, Tibet and Beijing have a 100-point  gap in the report's Human Development Index, the report said.
"These disparities contain the potential for major social, economic and  political unrest and deserve the urgent attention of policy makers," warns the  report which notes that the five-year old index has had "a major impact on  national and international policy dialogue."
