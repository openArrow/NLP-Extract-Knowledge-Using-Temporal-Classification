Appeals by Premiership clubs Chelsea, Newcastle  United and Manchester City to delay making their grounds all-seater have been  refused by the British government.
Now the trio, along with First Division Barnsley, Oldham Athletic and  Swindon Town, face a hectic summer adapting their grounds by the August 1  deadline.
National Heritage Secretary Peter Brooke said however that before making a  final decision he was prepared to consider further representations from them.
The decision to ban standing areas from Premiership and First Division  grounds followed Lord Justice Taylor's report on the 1989 Hillsborough  disaster, which resulted in the deaths of 96 fans.
Five clubs were granted an extension on the grounds that they plan to move  to new stadia.
They are Derby County, who will be promoted to the Premiership if they  beat Leicester City in their Wembley play-off on Monday, and First Division  clubs Grimsby Town, Middlesbrough, Portsmouth and Sunderland.
But Brooke warned: "Any extension should be for a limited period only."
