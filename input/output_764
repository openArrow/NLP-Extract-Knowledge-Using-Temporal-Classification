US Secretary of State Warren Christopher said  Sunday he would visit the first autonomous Palestinian enclave of Jericho on  Tuesday to assess how self-rule was being implemented.
Christopher was speaking to reporters on the plane bringing him to  Damascus on his second peace shuttle in as many weeks between Syria and Israel.
He said he expected to meet up in the West Bank town of Jericho with  Palestinian leaders Saeb Erekat and Faisal Husseini "to have an evaluation of  the implementation" of self-rule.
The secretary of state wanted to see "how the implementation is going and  how the structures they (Palestinians) are setting up to receive aid, work."
Christopher will be the first senior foreign dignitary to tour the town  since Israeli forces withdrew on Friday, to be replaced by a Palestinian  police force.
A US official accompanying Christopher said the donors who had pledged  financial aid to the Palestinians were expected to meet later this month to  discuss an "emergency rehabilitation project."
"Israel needs to see that the Palestinians live up to their commitments  and stop the violence," said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Christopher was set to arrive in Jerusalem on Monday from Damascus as he  launched another bid to bring the two countries back to the negotiating table.  He has not ruled out a return visit to the Syrian capital on Wednesday.
"There is a lot of work to do but the two parties are serious and they  have urged us to come back," he said.
But the secretary of state has played down his peace shuttle, saying he  did not expect a breakthrough.
