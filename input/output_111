A Chinese court has sentenced two US citizens to  prison terms of 20 and 14 years for their part in a major fraud case,  involving letters of credit totalling some 10 billion dollars, Xinhua said  Friday.
Francisco Hung Moy and Raymond Lee, both Chinese-Americans, were sentenced  to 20 and 14 years respectively by a court in the northern province of Hebei,  the official news agency said.
Two local Agricultural Bank of China officials were sentenced to 19 and 11  years for "revealing state secrets" as part of the swindle.
The sentences were handed down by the Hengshui intermediate people's court  last month and upheld by the Hebei higher people's court on appeal.
According to Xinhua, Hung Moy and Lee tricked the two bank officials --  Zhao Jinrong and Xu Zhiguo -- into issuing 200 irrevocable and transferable  standby letters of credit to the amount of 10 billion dollars.
The letters of credit were to cover three agreements signed by Zhao, Hung  Moy and Lee in April last year on "cooperatively introducing foreign capital  for investment and development projects" worth five billion, 1.6 billion and  3.4 billion dollars.
