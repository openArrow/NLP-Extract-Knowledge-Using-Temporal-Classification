The Bundesbank held its two key interest rates  unchanged on Thursday, a spokesman for the bank said at the end of a meeting  of the bank's policy-making central council.
The discount rate was held at 4.50 percent and the Lombard rate at six  percent. These rates had been set on May 12.
Economists had said that the bank was unlikly to reduce its key rates on  Thursday because it had last reduced them at the previous meeting of the  central council on May 11.
The bank had then reduced the discount rate by half a point to 4.50  percent and the Lombard rate by the same amount to six percent.
They noted that recent remarks by the president of the bank Hans Tietmeyer  implied that the bank would mark time in its process of easing rates. But they  held that the key rates might next be cut in September.
