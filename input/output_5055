Former US Open champion Scott Simpson  fashioned a flawless 64 Saturday to build a record 15-under total of 195 and a  four-shot lead after three rounds of the Colonial golf tournament.
Simpson's 54-hole aggregate bettered the old course and tournament mark of  197, set last year by South African Fulton Allem and Australian Greg Norman.
It also left him four shots clear of his nearest rival, Gary Hallberg, who  had a third-round 65.
The completetion of the third round Saturday put the rain-disrupted event  back on schedule. About half the 110-man field had to play their second rounds  Saturday morning.
Despite the delays, the rain may have contributed to Simpson's low score  as players were allowed to lift, clean and place their balls in the fairways  of the sodden course.
"Anytime you let players of this caliber get their hands on the ball, and  you have a course that is soft, low scoring is going to be the result," said  Hale Irwin.
Even so, Simpson's dominance was evident. Hallberg was the only challenger  to keep him in sight, and he said catching him would be tough.
"He's a very machine-like player," Hallberg said of Simpson. "He's very  steady. He gets in a groove and he just stays in it, like a machine. He's in a  zone, very focused."
Tom Lehman, winner of the Memorial last week, was in third after a 69 for  201. Irwin was level on 202 with Zimbabwe's Nick Price and Ken Green.
Irwin played two rounds Saturday, a 70 and a 68. Price carded a  third-round 67 and Green shot 69.
Simpson, who had a one-shot lead when the third round began, started at  the 10th where he sank a 30-footer from the fringe. He birdied 13, 14 and 16  and never looked back.
"I thought if I could birdie eight and nine and he could make a bogey then  that might make things more interesting," Hallberg said. "Well, I did my part.  I birdied eight and nine. But he didn't do his part. Instead of making bogey  he made birdie."
