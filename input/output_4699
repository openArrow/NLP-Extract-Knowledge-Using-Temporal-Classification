Italian Marco Saligari won the sixth stage  of the Tour of Italy here on Friday after a five-man sprint to record an  unusual hat-trick.
Saligari, who escaped in the breakaway in the opening kilometres of the  215km stage  between Potenza and Caserte, has now won a stage in the last  three Giros.
Overall leader Evgeni Berzin of Russia retained the pink jersey.
Saligari, 29, who won last year's Tour of Switzerland, stole away from the  peleton with fellow Italians Massimo Ghirotto, Ivan Gotti and Gianni Faresin,  as well as Heinz Imboden of Switzerland. Ghirotto came home in second.
