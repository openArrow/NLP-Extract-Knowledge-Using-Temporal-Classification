The new Palestinian intelligence  chief for Gaza and Jericho emerged Sunday from 27 years in the shadows, but  said he was "too tired" to talk and scrapped a welcome home party.
Brigadier-General Mosbah Hanafi Rushdie Sakr returned to his wife who  believed he was dead after he went missing during the 1967 Middle East war.
An AFP correspondent spotted the moustachioed general on Sunday walking to  a Gaza City cemetery where his mother and father were buried.
But the intelligence chief for the autonomous areas, who looked drawn and  pale in his olive-green uniform of the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA), said:  "I'm too tired to talk."
His family said they learned on Saturday that he would be coming home and  had prepared a welcoming party with other relatives.
But the general maintained his awesome reputation for discretion after,  according to Palestinian police officers, living half his life clandestinely  in Israel under a false name.
He apologized saying he was exhausted and asked for the celebrations to be  cancelled. Journalists were told to leave the family home.
A brief announcement from PLO headquarters in Tunis last week that Sakr  was to head the intelligence service stunned even those closest to the man,  who all believed him dead.
PLO chairman Yasser Arafat "announced to us, a few days ago, that he would  be the next chief of the intelligence services," an officer in the Palestinian  police force told AFP.
Born in Gaza in 1943, Sakr graduated as an officer from the Cairo military  academy in the late 1950s. He was PLA commander for the Khan Yunes area of  Gaza in 1967, when he disappeared without a trace.
A nephew, taxi-driver Bashir Sakr, said the head of the Palestinian police  force had contacted the family directly.
"General Nasr Yussef sent two of his men to my house ... and asked my  mother: 'Where's your brother Mosbah?' The poor woman replied she had no  idea," the nephew said.
"Then I met a deputy to the general who asked me what I knew of my uncle  Mosbah, and I replied that he was dead.
"He replied: 'No. Your uncle is alive and is living somewhere nearby. If  he turns up or calls, tell him that president Arafat wants to speak to him or  that he should come to our offices.'"
Some people believed General Sakr had drowned swimming the Jordan River  from the West Bank to Jordan.
But his brother Hamis said he had never really believed Mosbah was dead. "I  didn't wear black in mourning. I asked the International Committee of the Red  Cross but they never found him in Israeli prisons."
He also investigated in Amman and Beirut as well as with the PLO, who said  the general had died a martyr for the Palestinian cause.
"When I found out he was still alive, I burst into tears," said the  brother, a merchant in Gaza City.
Even the general's wife, Nismat Barzak, who runs a school, had no contact  with him throughout the Israeli occupation, according to the family.
Their two grown-up sons, who work abroad in Arab countries, also never saw  their father and "only know his face from old photographs," said Hamis.
