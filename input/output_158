India has thrown open basic telephone services  to  foreign and domestic private investors in a liberalised telecommunications  investment policy unveiled in parliament Friday.
The policy is aimed at ushering in the eight-billion-dollar investment the  government estimates is needed to provide a "telephone on demand" to its  citizens by 1997.
Individuals have had to wait five years for a connection.
Communications Minister Sukh Ram said it also was aimed at introducing all  "value-added telecom services available abroad" to raise the standard of  Indian telecommunications to world class.
The long-awaited policy, which has a theme of "telecommunications for  all," was announced on the eve of Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's  departure for a visit to the United States.
Major US telecom multinationals such as US West Inc. and Motorola Inc.  have been waiting to enter the huge Indian market, where basic telephone  services have until now been a government monopoly.
