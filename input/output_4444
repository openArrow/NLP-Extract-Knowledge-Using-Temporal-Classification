Nobel-prize winning Russian writer and  former dissident Alexander Solzhenitsyn left US soil Thursday after nearly 20  years in exile, flying out to the eastern Russian port of Vladivostok.
"I plan to take an active part in the social life of Russia. And as my  voice will be heard, I would like to have some influence on the Russia's  health," said Solzhenitsyn moments before boarding his flight.
Speaking through a translator, the 77-year-old Solzhenitsyn spoke of his  time in the United States.
"I leave with much emotion. I never dreamed this would be possible. This  was my host country, giving me the most productive period of my life," he said.
Soviet authorities expelled the writer in 1974 because his novels exposed  the darker side of Soviet society by focusing on life as a political prisoner.  He served eight years in prison camps for criticizing Joseph Stalin in a  letter to a friend.
He came to the United States in 1976 after spending two years in Europe,  eventually settling in rural Vermont.
Solzhenitsyn will arrive in Russia by way of the Siberian outpost of  Magada, a former receiving point for prisoners.
He is scheduled to deliver an address in Vladivostok from a rostrum  erected in the central square under the Soviet emblem which still adorns the  massive facade of city hall.
His first public appearance at home is expected to give an idea of what  sort of reception he will receive elsewhere as he makes his way across Russia  to Moscow.
