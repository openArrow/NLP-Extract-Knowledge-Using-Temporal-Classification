The planned sale by the Australian government of  its remaining share of the national flag-carrier Qantas would definitely  proceed "this year or early next year", Finance Minister Kim Beazley said  Sunday.
Qantas management, which had been forced to delay Canberra's original plan  to float the remaining shares this financial year rather than next, were  confident the float would be ready in 1994-95, he said in a televised  interview.
Canberra expects to raise around two billion dollars (1.4 billion U.S.  dollars) in the float of 75 percent of the airline, which follows the trade  sale of 25 percent of Qantas to British Airways earlier this year.
Former finance minister Ralph Willis, who is now treasurer, said last year  that the timing of the float could be delayed until the middle of next year by  share market conditions.
However, Beazley said it would proceed this year or early next.
Questioned also about the possibility of a rise in inflation because of  budgetary measures, he rejected suggestions the government's huge reliance on  business investment to meet its budget targets would drive up inflation rates.
Growth figures of 4.5 percent for the 1994/5 financial year announced in  last week's budget are predicated on 14 percent growth in business investment,  estimated by some at more than 44 billion (312 billion US).
Asked Sunday if such huge extra demands on funds would mean higher  inflation rates, Beazley said Canberra was "not assuming that's going to  occur".
"The economy is in a pretty good state of recovery," he added.
"The sorts of estimates for growth and increases in investment are things  which the economy has absorbed quite easily in the past. There is no reason to  assume that we are so weak that we can't absorb it now."
