Cambodian co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh  downplayed Monday reports of a Khmer Rouge attack on Mongkol Borey in  northwest Cambodia, calling rebel activity in the area "hit and run."
"They destroyed one bridge in the Mongkol Borey area," the prince told  journalists after he opened a prosthetics workshop here Monday. "It is hit and  run," he said.
A western aid official said Sunday that several people were reported  killed and a number of others wounded when Khmer Rouge guerrillas attacked a  bridge and an administrative building in Mongkol Borey.
Confirmation and exact casualty figures were still unavailable Monday.
A Cambodian government officer across the Thai border in Aranyaprathet  said Sunday that 50 guerrillas had blown up a section of a bridge on a road  connecting Mongkol Borey to the town of Sisophon.
Meanwhile, the Khmer Rouge claimed Monday to have seized control of  Mongkol Borey and to have complete control of the key roads linking  Battambang, Sisophon and Poipet.
But aid agency officials in Battambang said the road to Sisophon was open  to traffic Monday and that cars were able to cross the bridge.
In a broadcast monitored in Bangkok, Khmer Rouge radio said three columns  of guerrilla forces had hit government positions May 15 near the Mongkol Borey  bridge, at the town market and along the river south of town on Route 5.
Prince Ranariddh criticised the guerrillas for failing to agree to King  Norodom Sihanouk's idea for a total ceasefire, which was a precondition to  peace talks aimed at bringing an end to years of civil war.
He also said the government had requested military support from western  powers, but that "it was very sad that we have to continue to talk about  military assistance" given Cambodia's social and economic needs.
