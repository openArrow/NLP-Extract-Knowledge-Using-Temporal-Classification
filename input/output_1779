Dozens of settlers blocked the road  to the Netzarim settlement on Wednesday after Palestinians wounded one of them  in the first attack since the Israeli army pulled out earlier in the day,  military sources said.
The settler, shot in the leg, was the first person to be attacked as  autonomy finally started on the ground in the Gaza Strip earlier Wednesday.
He was attacked while driving along a road being built around the  settlement when Palestinians driving in the opposite direction opened fire.
Israeli soldiers posted round Netzarim did not return fire and the  Palestinians fled towards Gaza City.
Later Kalashnikov casings were found on the spot and several demonstrators  accused the Palestinian police, equipped with such guns, of being behind the  attack.
The demonstrators were demanding that the road should be declared  off-limits to Palestinian police and that the southern regional commander  General Matan Vilnai should travel to the area.
The Israeli army only finished redeploying and pulling out of the Strip  Wednesday after 27 years of occupation.
Settlers alleged that the Palestinian police had tried to provoke them in  the past three days as the Israeli army was pulling out by shooting in the air.
Netzarim is one of 19 settlements with a total of about 4,000 residents  which will stay in the Strip for the first five years of interim Palestinian  self-rule under the terms of the Israel-PLO autonomy accord.
But it is isolated in the middle of the Strip while the rest are grouped  together in the south.
Meanwhile in the Israeli-occupied West Bank town of Bethlehem two fire  bombs were thrown at the house of the Palestinian mayor Elias Freij without  causing any damage.
And a young Palestinian was seriously wounded in the eye by shots from  Israeli soldiers in the Israeli-occupied town of Nablus in the northern West  Bank.
Military sources said he was one of a group who had thrown stones at a  patrol.
