A conference to launch rebuilding of Sarajevo's  infrastructure and public services called by special UN envoy Yasushi Akashi  is to be held here next week, the UN office in the Austrian capital said on  Friday.
The two-day gathering, opening on Tuesday, is billed as a conference to  coordinate an action plan for the besieged Bosnian capital. The aim is to  mobilise widespread support for restoring the battered city. An appeal for  funds is to be made immediately after the meeting, with another conference due  in New York within a few months to finalise matters.
The Vienna meeting is being chaired by US diplomat William Eagleton, named  in March as UN civilian administrator for Sarajevo. Participants are to  include 31 countries, UN and other international bodies, non-governmental  organisations and municipal associations.
