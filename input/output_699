More than one billion people will suffer from  hunger in the year 2030 because of the world's population rise, the head of  the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) warned here Sunday.
In a meeting with Iran's President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in the  northern city of Rasht, Jacques Diouf urged FAO member states to "cooperate  closely to provide nutritional security in poor countries," Tehran Radio said.
He warned that 1.1 billion people would go hunger in 2030.
Rafsanjani said Iran had worked hard since the 1979 Islamic revolution to  ensure that its population was well-fed, and he urged other developing  countries to do the same.
Diouf, who arrived here Thursday, was with Rafsanjani for the opening of a  rice research institute in Rasht. He also called for boosting cooperation with  Iran in agriculture.
