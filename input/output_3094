An earthquake measuring 6.1 on the open-ended  Richter scale was recorded early Monday in the Sea of Crete, an Athens-based  geological institute reported.
Local authorities said the quake did not claim any victims but cracks  could be seen in homes on the northern part of the island of Crete.
The epicenter was located 300 kilometres (180 miles) south of Athens, off  the northern coast of Crete, between the towns of Rethymon and Heraklion.
