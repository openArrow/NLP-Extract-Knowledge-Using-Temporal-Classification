Russian President Boris Yeltsin arrived Monday in  the central Russian republic of Tatarstan to assess the effect of a  decentralisation accord struck in February.
Tatar President Mintimer Shaimiyev welcomed Yeltsin at the airport in  Naberezhnye Chelny and immediately reaffirmed his support for the principle of  "strong republics with a strong centre", referring to the republic's links  with Moscow.
Yeltsin described the treaty as "very important for us and for me as  president." He said the accord had allowed Tatarstan to take on as much  responsibility as it could cope with.
"What is beyond its capabilities it has delegated that to the federal  authorities," ITAR-TASS quoted him as saying.
Shaimiyev said the two leaders wanted to strengthen mutual trust to find  "a joint solution to economic problems."
The Russian president hopes to apply a similar model of division of powers  to Chechnya, the Caucasus republic which has declared independence from Moscow.
Yeltsin opened his visit with a tour of oil-rich Tatarstan's industrial  region around Naberezhnyye Chelny accompanied by First Vice Prime Minister  Oleg Soskovets and other ranking officials.
ITAR-TASS meanwhile quoted the Russian leader as saying he stood by  remarks he made in 1991 saying Russian republics and regions should take as  much sovereignty as they could stand, despite criticism of his position at the  time.
"I endured it all and was right," he said.
A Chechen presidential spokesman meanwhile told AFP that Chechnya did not  support the "Tatar variant" of relations with Moscow.
Movladi Udugov said President Dzhokhar Dudayev, who escaped an  assassination attempt Friday, was "not ready to renounce independence" from  Russia.
The authorities in Grozny on Monday accused the Russian secret services of  staging a failed assassination bid against Dudayev.
