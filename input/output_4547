Most Israelis are opposed to the government  holding negotiations on extending Palestinian self-rule following an uproar  over comments by PLO leader Yasser Arafat, an opinion poll showed on Friday.
Asked whether the government should continue talks with the PLO on  extending autonomy in the West Bank, 63 per cent of Israelis said no, 35 said  yes and the others were undecided.
Israeli radio has broadcast extracts from a May 10 speech in a  Johannesburg mosque in which Arafat called for a "jihad" to liberate Jerusalem  and suggested his peace deal with Israel was a tactical move which could be  reversed.
The comments made 27 per cent of those polled switch from being in favour  of negotiations to being against, according to the survey of 500 people  carried out Tuesday and Wednesday for the Yediot Aharonot newspaper.
