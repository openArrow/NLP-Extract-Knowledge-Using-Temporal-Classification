Eighth-seeded Sabatini's nightmare continued when she went down 6-2, 2-6,  4-6 to a player ranked just outside the top-100. But she hid her disappoinment  well.
The South American admitted that her loss to Mary Joe Fernandez 6-2, 6-7  (4/7), 8-10 on the same court in last year's quarter-final after leading 5-1  in the second set, had been "far worse."
"It took me a long time to get over that because I should have won it. But  today was different. She played really well. I don't think this defeat was so  bad."
Silvia Farina, 22, who said she had gone for bust when she "saw fear" in  Sabatini's eyes in the third set, now plays 16-year-old Croatian Iva Majoli  who defeated Belgium's Dominque Monami in straight-sets.
Sabatini, who was 24 last week, has not won a title since the 1992 Italian  Open. And her latest reverse, on her favourite surface, must raise new  questionmarks over her future.
Farina often left Sabatini stranded with deft drop shots and the  Argentinian's concentration was not helped by the fidgety crowd.
Date, who has never found Paris a happy hunting ground and who went out in  the second-round last year, was well beaten and won only three games against  the 18th-ranked Amanda Coetzer.
The South African, who has been enjoying an excellent season, now faces  either Radka Bobova of the Czech Repulic and could well be heading for a  fourth-round clash against big-hitting twelfth-seeded Mary Pierce of France.
So far this season Coetzer has been a runner-up to Steffi Graf at Indian  Wells and a winner at Prague where she defeated Sweden's Asa Carlsson 6-1, 7-6.
The defeat was a bitter disappointment for the 23-year-old Japanese player  who has posted tournament wins at both Sydney and Tokyo and reached the  semi-finals at the Australian Open.
