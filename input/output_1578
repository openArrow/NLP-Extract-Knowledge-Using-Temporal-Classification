Twenty nine of Russia's 100 airports were shut down  Wednesday after 80 percent, or some 50,000, of the country's pilots began a  strike to protest falling safety standards and poor retirement benefits, the  pilots' union said.
The transport ministry's press office called the strike illegal and said  the prosecutor's office had begun legal proceedings against the union. A court  hearing on the matter was scheduled at mid-day Wednesday.
Among the airports affected were the Saint Petersburg airport in western  Russia as well as several airports in Siberia and southern Russia.
The Moscow airports of Domodyedovo and Bykovo, which handle internal  flights and flights to countries within the Commonwealth of Independent  States, were also affected.
Boris Medvedenko, a union leader, said pilots at the capital's two private  airports, one of which handles international flights, did not follow the  strike call.
Transport Minister Vitaly Efimov minimized the falling safety standards of  Russian airlines Tuesday but aknowledged that the death rate per million  passengers had gone up from 3.5 to 5.5 between 1992 and 1993.
