A league match between arch-rivals Kaizer  Chiefs and Orlando Pirates was abandoned Saturday when rioting fans invaded  the pitch and set fire to part of the giant FNB stadium in Soweto.
The fighting began in the second half when Chiefs, leading 1-0, were  awarded a disputed penalty.
Hostile Pirates fans stormed onto the pitch and began pelting soccer  officials with cans and an assortment of objects. Others set fire to the  plastic seats in the stands and to the grass surrounding the stadium.
The blazes were extinguished by members of the fire brigade.
The incident was witnessed by members of the English Premier League clubs  Liverpool and Aston Villa, who are in the country for a series of friendly  matches against a number of South African clubs, among them Kaizer Chiefs.
Fierce rivalry between Chiefs and Pirates, who both hail from sprawling  Soweto black township near Johannesburg, has resulted in a number of similar  unsavoury incidents in recent years.
