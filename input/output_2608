A US arms control expert will visit Slovakia,  Hungary and Macedonia this month to discuss nonproliferation of weapons of  mass destruction and other security matters, the State Department said Friday.
Under Secretary of State Lynn Davis will visit the three countries in a  tour beginning Sunday and ending May 28.
Also to be discussed will be export controls and the Partnership for Peace  program that allows Eastern European countries some affiliation with NATO.
"This is the first trip by a senior US government official to these  countries for a broad discussion of nonproliferation, arms control and  international security issues," the State Department said in a statement.
