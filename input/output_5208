A return to Formula One could be  more attractive for England's Nigel Mansell, who ended Sunday's Indianapolis  500 burnt, bruised and angry after a bizarre crash during a caution period.
"I've never seen anything that's such a joke," the reigning Indy-car  champion said of the incident which ended his day after 92 laps in the 200-lap  race.
"There are no words to express my disappointment," said Mansell, a former  F1 champion who has been the subject of interest by the Williams team of the  late Ayrton Senna. "I'm almost in shock being put out of the race under a  yellow flag."
Mansell's car was rear-ended in a pit access lane during a caution period  by first-time Indy 500 starter Dennis Vitolo, whose car went airborne and  landed backwards atop the rear of Mansell's car.
"He must have hit me at over 100 mph (160 km/h) more than I was doing,"  said Mansell, who apparently suffered a mild concussion but chose not to  undergo further medical tests here.
Mansell was running in third place at the time of the incident, trailing  leader Emerson Fittipaldi and second-placed Al Unser Jnr after overcoming an  early penalty for passing in a caution period.
Crashes by John Paul and Japanese rookie Hideshi Matseda prompted the  caution period. Debris in the third turn from Paul's crash forced cars to slow  and enter the pit access area where Vitolo hit Mansell.
"What can I say? I'm almost in shock," Mansell said. "It was the stupidity  of the incident. One moment I was easily moving down the pit lane at low  speed. The next somebody's car lands backwards on top of me."
