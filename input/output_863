Britain's output prices rose by 0.3 percent in  April from March, compared with a revised 0.2 percent in March, provisional,  seasonally-corrected figures from the central statistical office (CSO) showed  Monday.
Over the year to the end of April, output prices rose 2.2 percent -- the  lowest annual increase since December 1986 -- compared to a revised figure of  2.8 percent for the year to the end of March.
The figures were better than analysts' forecasts of a monthly rise of 0.3  percent and an annual rise of 2.2 percent.
A Treasury spokesman said the figures showed "further evidence of weak  inflationary pressures."
Input prices rose by 0.4 percent in April, from a revised figure of 0.1  percent in March.
Over the year to the end of April, input prices fell 1.5 percent after  dropping a revised 2.8 percent in the year to the end of March.
Excluding food, drink, tobacco and oil products, output prices rose by 0.2  percent last month and by 2.2 percent on the year -- the lowest annual rise  since April 1993, the CSO said.
