Russian President Boris Yeltsin has refused to  accept the resignation of Vice Premier Sergei Shakhrai, who this week was  stripped of the portfolio of minister of nationalities, a presidential  spokesman said Thursday.
Shakhrai had complained he was not consulted in advance about the new  nationalities minister and said he could not remain in the government.
Presidential spokesman Viatsheslav Kostikov said: "When the president  signed the decree nominating the (new) minister of nationalities, he wanted to  allow the vice premier to focus on coordinating several matters on which he  was already working."
Kostikov said "the reasons Mr. Shakhrai gave in his letter (of  resignation) to the president are thus considered as insufficient and his  request to resign has been refused."
