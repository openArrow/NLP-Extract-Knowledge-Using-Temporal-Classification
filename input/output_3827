The dollar continued to rise against the main  European currencies early on Wednesday on news that the United States and  Japan had agreed to resume trade talks, but dealers said it might fall later.
The dollar rose to 1.6550 marks from 1.6525 at the previous close, but  remained stable against the yen at 104.70 yen from 104.85.
"The dollar looks a bit toppish at these levels and there is a risk of  retracement to 1.6480-mark support level during the day," said Peter Luxton,  economist at Barclays Bank.
On Tuesday, US and Japanese trade representatives announced that they had  agreed to resume talks broken off three months ago on liberalizing trade,  sending the dollar higher.

But the German currency was higher against the Scandinavian currencies  after poor Danish inflation figures on Tuesday. These showed a rise of 0.4  percent in April.
