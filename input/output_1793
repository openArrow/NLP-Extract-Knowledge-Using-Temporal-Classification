Former French minister for humanitarian aid Bernard  Kouchner proposed Wednesday the creation of a rapid deployment force under UN  command to end the bloodshed in Rwanda.
Speaking on French television after returning from the war-ravaged  country, Kouchner said: "Before the massacres people said there was no money,  not enough manpower, no political will (to resolve the conflict)."
He added that, once the massacres had happened, money, manpower and  political determination existed. "But now it's too late. One must act early."
Five weeks of fighting have reportedly seen some 500,000 people killed.
Kouchner said that pictures shown on television were taken on the borders  where the situation was not the worst. "You have to think of what is going on  in central Rwanda where one cannot film."
He said there were thousands of orphans in the capital Kigali, but "to  reach one of them, we had to get past 22 blocks of militia armed with a  machete in one hand and a grenade in the other."
"You find the heads of decapitated children in the grass," Kouchner  continued. "The assassinations are continuing, the genocide is continuing."
He said he disagreed with theories saying the violence had its roots in  ethnic rivalry between the minority Tutsis and the majority Hutus.
"That's wrong. What is happening is pure genocide, ethnic cleansing  committed by fascists. Don't forget that the victims of the first massacres on  the night of April 6 to 7 were democratic Hutus favouring cohabitation between  both ethnic groups."
