Fresh advice from American tennis guru Nick Bolletieri propelled Boris  Becker into his best clay court showing for two years.
The German slowed down enough to beat Frenchman Cedric Pioline 6-3, 6-4.  Becker last got this far on clay in Hamburg two years ago when he was beaten  by compatriot Michael Stich in the semi-finals.
Bolletieri, who nurtured Andre Agassi, Jim Courier and Monica Seles in  their formative years, has been with the German for three months.
"Nick makes work fun," Becker said. "We have been working on clay for  four weeks and every day I feel that I am playing a little bit better."
