Aston Villa and England winger Tony  Daley is set for a 1.3 million pound move to Wolves.
The fee has been agreed between the two clubs and Daley expects to speak  to new Wolves manager Graham Taylor before he is due to depart on Villa's trip  to South Africa on Thursday.
Daley, 26, played the best football of his Villa career under Taylor in  the late 1980s and was called up by the same manager to play in England's  fruitless assault on the 1992 European Championships finals in  Sweden.
Daley was on the brink of his dream move to Italy in the autumn but the  move collapsed when Udinese pulled out.
Daley ended the season in Villa's first team and played in their League  Cup victory over Manchester United at Wembley in March.
"This move could suit Tony ideally," said Villa manager Ron Atkinson. "He  has felt for some time that a change would do him good."
Daley said: "I've been told a fee has been agreed and I will almost  certainly be having a chat with Graham Taylor in the next day or so.
"However, it is unlikely anything could be finalised until after Villa's  trip to South Africa."
Taylor is expected to buy big this summer in preparing Wolves for a  sustained push for the Premiership in his first season back in club football.
