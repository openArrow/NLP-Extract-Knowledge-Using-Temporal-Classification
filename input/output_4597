The finance ministry will allow domestic and  foreign firms to set up distilleries here to assist Taiwan's bid to join the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), officials said on Friday.
The finance ministry officials said that the authorities would also drop  regional discrimination against Japan and southeast Asian countries by  allowing them to enter the alcoholic beverage market.
The government-run Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau (TTWMB) is the  only brewer on the island and levies a 16.60 Taiwan dollar (61 US cents)  monopoly tax on each packet of imported cigarettes.
To strengthen the island's bid to join the world trade body, the ministry  is to liberalise the alcoholic drink and cigarette markets after its  much-criticised tobacco and wine monopoly system is abolished by June 1995.
Brewers in Japan, Germany and the Netherland, have shown strong interest  in building low-alcohol distilleries and breweries in Taiwan, they said.
The United States and other countries, including France and Britain, have  criticised Taiwan for limiting market access and imposing the monopoly tax as  well as slapping tariffs on imports.
Succumbing to Washington's pressure to reduce the bilateral trade  imbalance, Taiwan freed up imports of US tabacco products and alcoholic drinks  in 1987. It has also opened the market to similar imports from Europe.
But Japan and some southeast Asian countries are still barred from selling  cigarette and wine products to Taiwan.
According to statistics compiled by the TTWMB, the island imported four  million litres (1.04 million gallons) of whisky in the 10 months to April, up  from 2.95 million litres (767,000 gallons) in the fiscal year to June 1993.
Imports of brandy in the July-April period amounted to 2.9 million litres  (754,000 gallons), compared with 2.0 million litres (520,000 gallons).
