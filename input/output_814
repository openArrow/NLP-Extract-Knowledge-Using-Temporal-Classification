The Israeli army on Monday  quit the central prison and military administration buildings here, an AFP  correspondent saw.
Following the departure of the Israeli troops, 150 Palestinian police from  Egypt took control of the prison as hundreds of people were chanting and  dancing outside and armed Fatah activists fired shots from automatic weapons  in the air.
Palestinian police barred all access to the prison.
On Monday, Israeli troops continued to control the military government  headquarters, the passport and official documents department, police  headquarters, police barracks and Hof military camp.
They were to withdraw from the city by Wednesday.
Overnight Sunday, 450 police arrived in Gaza from Egypt, according to a  spokesman at the Palestinian police headquarters.
So far, 2,050 troops of the Palestine Liberation Army have entered the  Gaza Strip and Jericho in line with the May 4 deal to launch autonomy in the  two areas. Under the agreement, a total of 7,000 police will be brought in  from outside Gaza and Jericho and 2,000 others will be recruited in the  occupied territories.
