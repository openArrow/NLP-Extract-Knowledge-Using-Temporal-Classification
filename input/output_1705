More than 100,000 people went on strike here  Wednesday to protest the government's social policies and a reduction in their  salaries due to devaluation of the national currency, the lev, union  organisers said.
The general strike, which began Tuesday, involved trade, light industry  and chemical industry workers as well as transport employees.
Local radio said some of the employees walked off the job for only a  couple hours.
The strike is expected to continue through Friday and then resume next  Wednesday due to the upcoming holiday weekend.
Krastio Petkov, leader of the Independent Unions, one of the country's  main trades union, said he would only call off the strike if parliament gave  "guarantees" compensating for the dip in workers' standards of living in  recent months, and on stabilising the lev whose value has slipped since the  beginning of the year.
The centrist government of Prime Minister Luben Berov faces a  no-confidence vote on Wednesday called by the anti-communist opposition Union  of Democratic Forces, and a mass demonstration has been called for the same  day.
