President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary,  on Friday remembered former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who died  late Thursday of cancer, as a model of courage and dignity.
"Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was a model of courage and dignity for all  Americans and all the world," Clinton said.
"More than any other woman of her time, she captivated our nation and the  world with her intelligence, her elegance and her grace," he said of the widow  of slain president John F. Kennedy and Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle  Onassis, who died at her New York apartment at age 64.
"Even in the face of impossible tragedy, she carried the grief of her  family and our entire nation with a calm power that somehow reassured all of  us who mourned," said the president, in a reference to the 1963 assassination  of Kennedy as he rode beside her in a presidential calvacade in Dallas, Texas.
Speaking in the First Lady's garden at the White House, the Clintons  underscored their personal loss at Onassis' death, saying she had become a  good friend.
Hillary Clinton said the United States "has lost a treasure."
The first lady, pointing out that the garden in which they stood was one  of the legacies of Onassis when she lived in the White House, said the former  First Lady had exemplified "the meaning of responsibility -- to one's family  and to one's community."
Onassis had advised her on how to protect the privacy of her daughter,  Chelsea, from the pressures of the White House, Hillary Clinton said.
The president recalled Onassis' passion for "art and music, poetry and  books," and stressed that she was "equally passionate about improving the  human condition."
Clinton, who left immediately for a two-day visit to California, did not  say whether he would attend the Onassis funeral.
