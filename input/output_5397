The dollar and the German mark remained stable on  the money market here Monday morning with little trading as markets remained  closed because of bank holidays in London and New York.
At 1130 GMT, the dollar was trading at 1.6445 German marks compared to  1.6440 at Friday's close, 5.6185 French francs (5.6210) and 104.38 yen  (104.40).
The only factor limiting last week's downward pressure in European markets  on the dollar was the fear of intervention by central banks, Forex Finance  said.
In early May, the US and European central banks intervened to prop up the  greenback.
The yen, for its part, has managed to hold its own against the dollar  pending the resumption of US-Japanese trade talks.
The French franc remained stable at 3.4170 to the German mark (3.4177 on  Friday), while sterling was trading at 8.4850 francs (8.4757 on Friday).
