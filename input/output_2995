Twenty-nine Ukrainian armored personnel carriers  conducted exercises in the Crimean capital Simferopol Sunday, the ITAR-TASS  news agency reported.
The vehicles arrived from Djankoi, in the north of the peninsula, the  agency said without providing a source for its report.
Crimea and Ukraine have been locked in a political crisis since Friday  when the Crimean parliament revived a constitution tantamount to a declaration  of independence. Ukraine gave the territory 10 days to reverse the move.
Talks between the two sides are scheduled for Tuesday in Moscow.
ITAR-TASS also said Russian-commanded ground units of the Black Sea Fleet  also held exercises Sunday near Sevastopol, the Crimean city where the fleet  is based.
