An international women's conference  here condemned the treatment of women in war-torn Bosnia Sunday at its  inaugural meeting attended by hundreds of women ministers, deputies and  intellectuals.
The meeting of women from Europe and the Mediterranean also said the  international community had a duty to defend Bosnia-Hercegovina's territorial  integrity.
Attacking "barbarous aggression" which has wracked the former Yugoslav  republic for more than two years, the conference expressed "complete  solidarity" with victims of "inhumane treatment," particularly women.
In a declaration the delegates welcomed the Palestinian autonomy accord  signed by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation to cover the Gaza  Strip and West Bank town of Jericho.
They also called on both sides to move quickly to settle outstanding  issues, including the status of East Jerusalem, and urged other Middle East  states including Syria, Lebanon and Jordan to work towards peace with Israel.
On education issues, the conference expressed concern that women and girls  accounted for two-thirds of illiterate people in the world, declaring  "education is a fundamental right."
