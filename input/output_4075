The Press Complaints Commission (PCC) Wednesday  upheld a complaint on behalf of Prince Edward over pictures of him kissing his  girlfriend Sophie Rhys-Jones, which were published by five British newspapers.
The pictures, taken with a long lens without the couple's permission while  they were on the Queen's estate at Balmoral, Scotland, were published in the  Daily Express, the Daily Star, the Daily Mirror, The Sun and the Today  newspaper on May 3.
The Daily Express, Daily Star and the Daily Mirror all apologised for  causing offence.
But the Sun newspaper remained unrepentant. A comment piece in Thursday's  edition said: "Fair enough, we broke the rules about long-lens cameras. But we  do not, and will not, apologise for showing you those pictures.
"The man who made the complaint, Charles Anson, is the Queen's press  secretary. He's a manipulator of the Press who likes to tell newspapers what  they can do..."
It added: "the crazy thing is that we know that Prince Edward wasn't  offended by our pictures and he would have liked the complaint to have been  withdrawn."
Today accepted the newspaper broke the long-lens rule, saying: "We were  wrong and we regret."
But it also claimed Anson, not the prince, was behind the complaint.
A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: "The Palace has been informed of the  PCC's adjudication and welcomed it."
The complaint was the first made under the PCC's new code of conduct,  which states that "the use of long-lens photography to take pictures on  private property without consent is not generally acceptable".
