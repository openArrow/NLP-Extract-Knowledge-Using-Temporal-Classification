The Hong Kong government may hire  bounty-hounters to track down and slay rogue killer sharks and reassure the  colony's swimmers it is safe to go into the water this summer, a government  spokesman said Monday.
"Jaws-Busters" were one of a number of ideas floated at a special working  committee set up to deal with the perceived shark threat, recreation and  culture department spokesman Chris Yit said.
Terror hit Hong Kong's beaches last year after sharks killed two swimmers  in as many weeks.
A spate of shark sightings which followed the attacks kept beaches  deserted and swimmers out of the water.
Shark-supporters say the incidence of fish attacks is very low, and  contend bathers are more at threat from the slime of human waste and  industrial refuse that washes up on the colony's beaches.
