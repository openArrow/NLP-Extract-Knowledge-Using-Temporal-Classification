Former Formula One champion Nigel  Mansell's Indianapolis 500 ended after 92 laps with his car beneath that of  rival Dennis Vitolo.
Mansell departed the track hospital with little apparent injury, though  doctors said he appeared to suffer a mild concussion.
"Mr. Mansell walked out before we could complete our exam so I really  don't know what his condition is," the chief medical officer said.
Mansell leaped from his car after a fire began in a freak accident that  took place at low speed in a pit access lane.
Vitolo, a first-time Indy starter, rear-ended Mansell's car while both  were in the pit lane after avoiding crashes involving John Paul and Japanese  rookie Hideshi Matseda.
Vitolo's car, which had just been refueled, was airborne briefly before  landing on the rear of Mansell's car.
Mansell leaped out of his cockpit into the waiting arms of a safety  worker, apparently on fire. Mansell rolled into the grass, bringing his hands  to his helmet.
Mansell was running in third place at the time of the incident, trailing  leader Emerson Fittipaldi and second-place Al Unser Jnr.
"He's OK, there's no burns," said Paul Newman, co-owner of Mansell's team.  "I guess he's pretty angry."
Mansell was less circumspect.
"I've never seen anything that's such a joke," he said. "We were under a  yellow flag for a lap and a half and somebody tries to take my head off.
"I don't feel great," Mansell said as he left the circuit's clinic. "I've  got a bit of concussion. I upset the medical people, they wanted me to go to  the hospital.
