Fox Inc., the fourth largest US television  network, said Monday it is gaining 12 new stations in major markets as part of  a 500 million dollar investment in the New World chain of television stations.
The agreement will make Fox affiliates of a dozen New World stations that   had been affiliated with ABC, CBS or NBC, the major US networks.
The agreement constitutes a significant advance for Fox which seven years  after it was formed aspires to be the largest US network.
It scored a coup last year when it acquired the rights to rebroadcast US  pro football matches, which had been held for 30 years by CBS.
"This is the greatest realignment of television station affiliation in the  60 year history of American broadcasting," said Fox owner Rupert Murdoch.
"We will be adding to the Fox network 12 powerful VHF stations with the  finest reputations for news and local programming in their major markets," he  said.
In the United States, local frequencies are held by different companies  that affiliate themselves with the networks of their choice. Until Fox was  formed, there were only three networks.
New World stations in Atlanta, Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee and Tampa  will immediately join the Fox network, followed by stations in Boston and San  Diego.
Stations in Dallas, St Louis and Austin, which were in the process of  being acquired by New World, would become Fox affiliates by March 1995.
Once the agreement is concluded, Fox will divest itself of its own local  stations in Dallas and Atlanta.
