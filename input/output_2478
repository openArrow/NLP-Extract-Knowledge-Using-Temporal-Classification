China has again rejected US allegations that it  is still exporting prison labour products in defiance of two bilateral  agreements, the official Xinhua news agency said Friday.
A senior official of the Chinese judicial department said it was "entirely  false" that factories in China were "prison-labour factories," and said no  prisoner-made goods had been exported to the United States.
The retort was in response to allegations by Harry Wu, a former Chinese  prisoner, that he had secretly photographed and video-taped prisons disguised  as factories that continued to export goods to the United States.
He told journalists that the Shadong United Steel Tube Company in the  eastern Shadong province had shipped 180,000 pounds of tubing to two  Florida-based companies.
Wu, who now heads the US Laogai Research Foundation, also said 2,000  prisoners were producing tools which were exported to the US market, charges  denied by the judicial department official.
The official was quoted by Xinhua in a report monitored here as saying Wu  had fabricated the videos using footage taken in the streets "to spread  sensational rumours, in an attempt to deceive the general public."
He said China was "conscientious" in implementing the memorandum of  understanding between the two countries, banning trade in prison-labour  products.
On Thursday Chinese foreign minister spokesman Wu Jianmin also denied Wu's  accusations, denouncing them as "sheer fabrication."
Ending such exports was one of the key conditions laid down by US  President Bill Clinton for renewing China's most-favoured-nation status, which  comes up for extension on June 3.
