The other five-setter was won by 19-year-old Hendrik Dreekman who, like  Ivanisevic, came back after trailing by two sets to love to Richey Reneberg of  the United States.
The 6ft 2in German finally edged through 4-6, 3-6 6-4, 6-4, 6-4.
Alberto Berasategui of Spain looked one of the day's most impressive  performers.
The 20-year-old from Bilbao, who upset Jim Courier in the final at Nice  last month, beat powerful 6ft 3in Russian newcomer Yevgeny Kafelnikov for the  loss of only seven games.
Kafelnikov, also 20 and a finalist at Hamburg and a semi-finalist at  Monaco, may have been suffering from an overbooked pre-Roland Garros schedule.  He looked jaded and tired and probably paid the price for a successful season.
When he entered the events he probably didn't expect to play so many  matches.
Berasategui now faces Andrea Gaudenzi. The 35th-ranked Italian had played  just ten games when French opponent Arnaud Boetsch was forced to retire with a  groin injury.
There was better news for the home fans in the women's singles where Julie  Halard and Alexia Dechaume joined Mary Pierce in the fourth-round -- Halard  putting out ninth-seeded Lindsay Davenport.
At the end of the day only seven women's seeds and five men's seeds were  still in the tournament -- Ivanisevic being the only seeded player in the  bottom half of the men's draw.
