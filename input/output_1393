Differences between Oslo and Washington on  whaling apparently dominated a 45-minute meeting between Norwegian Prime  Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland and US President Bill Clinton Tuesday.
The gap cropped up even before the Oval Office meeting, when the two  leaders took a few questions from reporters.
"The US has taken a position opposed to commercial whaling," said Clinton.  "We think we're doing the right thing."
But when Brundtland was asked if Oslo's legalization of whaling flouted an  international ban, she replied, "No, I certainly don't. We would never have a  policy which is not in accordance with international law, ... not in this  issue, not in any other."
Outside the White House, protesters organized by the environmental group  Greenpeace and dressed as whales marched outside to protest Norway's whale  hunting.
Vice President Al Gore, who has specialized in the environment, said that  Washington supported a whale sanctuary in the Antarctic and hoped that Norway  would support that proposal.
France first proposed the sanctuary in 1992 aimed a protecting whales  south of the 40th parallel for at least 50 years. Norway and Japan are  expected to oppose the plan when it is taken up at a meeting of the  International Whaling Commission on May 23 in Mexico.
Clinton said he was convinced that Norway and the United States would come  to an agreement on the issue.
In advance of the meeting, White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said that  the president would thank Norway for its contributions in UN peacekeeping  operations.
She said Clinton would also thank Brundtland for Norway's hosting of the  secret meetings that led to the September signing of an agreement between the  Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel giving Palestinians  autonomy in the Gaza strip and West Bank town of Jericho.
