Zhang's movie -- which is widely tipped as a strong contender for the Palm  -- tells the story of three generations of a family living through the  Cultural Revolution, while the Russian director's movie contrasts an idyllic  family life against the Stalinist purges of 1936.
The Ecumenical jury also gave a special mention to "Rice People" by  Cambodian Rithy Panh, which depicts rural family life in the rice-fields of  Cambodia, and the tragedy brought to it by an apparently minor accident.
Also awarded Sunday was the UNESCO prize, which went to "Curfew" by  Palestian filmmaker Rashid Masharawi, whose film was shown in the Critics'  Week section of the festival.
The film depicts a day in the life of a family living in a refugee camp in  the Gaza Strip.
The judges of the UN cultural body said the film "reconstructs with rare  integrity, and in sensitive cinematographic language, what has been the  everyday reality for the inhabitants of this troubled region."
