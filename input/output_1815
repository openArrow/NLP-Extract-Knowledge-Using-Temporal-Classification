Wu received international renown briefly several years ago on the highly  acclaimed "60 Minutes" CBS television show for clandestine footage he took of  dealmaking with Chinese businessmen and officials for prison-produced products.
He appeared at a packed news conference flanked by California Democratic  Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Tom Lantos, Edward Markey, a Massachusetts  Democrat and several other congressmen who hailed his dangerous expedition.
Pelosi said the group of congressmen would present the evidence gathered  by Wu to the US Customs Service to investigate the apparent violations  uncovered by Wu.
Pelosi said that Clinton had a range of options available to him in  deciding the MFN case and said she would prepare legislation that calls for  "targetted revocation" of MFN for some state-owned industries.
Business leaders have stridently objected to targetting state-owned  industries as unenforceable, a contention Pelosi rejected saying companies  interested in protecting intellectual property have been able to find them.
