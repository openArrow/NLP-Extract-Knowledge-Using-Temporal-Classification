Authorities in the breakaway Russian Caucasus  republic of Chechnya accused Monday the Russian secret service of being behind  the recent failed attempt to assassinate President Dzhokar Dudayev.
Movlady Udugov, Dudayev's spokesman, said last Friday's car-bomb attack  near the capital Grozny was the work of "local experts working for Yevgueny  Primakov," the head of Russia's foreign intelligence service.
Udugov, reached by telephone from Moscow, also blamed the Russian secret  service for the recent hijacking of a bus in southern Russia.
Dudayev escaped unhurt from the car bomb attack in which his interior  minister, Magomed Eldiyev, his deputy in charge of criminal affairs, Said Ali  Batayev, and their driver were all killed.
Quoting foreign ministry sources, Interfax news agency said Dudayev's  11-year-old son was hit by glass in the attack, but his condition was  "satisfactory." His wife was also hurt, but it gave no details on her  condition.
Tensions between Moscow and Chechnya have run high since October 1991  when the tiny Moslem republic declared independence.
