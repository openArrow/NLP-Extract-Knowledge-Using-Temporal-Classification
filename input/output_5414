Hendrik Dreekmann restored Germany's battered morale  at the French Open on Monday when he stormed into the quarter-finals at the  expense of the man who dumped Michael Stich out of the tournament.
Dreekmann survived a nervous start to beat American Aaron Krickstein 6-4,  6-4, 6-4 in what turned out to be a one-sided match.
The powerful 19-year-old, who began to emerge from the shadow of Stich,  Boris Becker and Marc Goellner with his appearance in the final at Sun City  earlier this year, mixed up his game with intelligent changes of pace and  clever drop shots.
All his out-of-sorts opponent could manage was some variation in his  unforced errors.
Having started with great expectations, the German stars have had a  miserable tournament. Becker was ruled out by a back injury, Goellner lost in  the first round and Stich, who many people saw as a potential champion, was  routed by Krickstein in the second.
