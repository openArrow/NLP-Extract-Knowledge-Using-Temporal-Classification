Former Austrian president Kurt Waldheim has denied  involvement with the Central Intelligence Agency, the Standard newspaper  reported here Thursday, following allegations by the US media.
Waldheim, who was declared persona non grata by the United States in 1987  for activities in the German army during World War II, said he favoured  publication of CIA documents pertaining to him to allow him to deny the rumors.
The former UN secretary-general was responding to allegations by the US  media according to which the US State Department covered up his wartime  activities because of his close ties and support for US interests in the early  60s.
Waldheim was Austrian ambassador to the UN in 1966 and foreign minister in  1968.
The fact of being "friendly to the United States does not mean I was its  agent," Waldheim told the Standard.
Washington later banned Waldheim after allegations emerged on his  involvement in deportations and executions in Yugoslavia where he served in  the army of the German Reich.
