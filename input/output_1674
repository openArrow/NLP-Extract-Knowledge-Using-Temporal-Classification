Southern forces launched a heavy offensive on  northern forces with battles still raging after 15 hours of fighting at Abyan,  southeast of Aden, a southern military source said.
"There are violent battles now at Abyan between southern forces and the  units from the (northern) Al-Amalika brigade, 15 hours since the start of the  offensive," the southern army source said.
The southern forces told Al-Amlika commanders "to surrender with their  heavy weapons," but the northerners have refused and demanded to "retreat from  their positions with their arms," the source said.
He also said 1,500 northern officers and soldiers had surrendered at  another front in the Karich region, 45 kilometers (27 miles) northeast of Aden.
There was no confirmation or denial of the fighting from the northern side.
But combats have crept closer to Aden, where the exchange of heavy  artillery could be heard Wednesday for the first time since the start of the  civil war.
According to the source, rival forces were retreating from positions in  Abyan in face of a southern advance as troops tried to recapture positions  seized by the north since the start of the two-week-old civil war.
At the same time, the southern Al-Taysir brigade, based in the oil-rich  region of Shabwa, has "inflicted heavy losses" on the northern army in the  town of Mudia, 100 kilometers (62 miles) northeast of Aden.
Fighting between troops loyal to President Ali Abdallah Saleh and forces  led by his southern rival Ali Salem al-Baid broke out on May 5 after a long  running dispute on how to run the country, created when former North and South  Yemen were merged in May 1990.
