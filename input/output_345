Dockworkers in Lagos have called off a strike which  paralysed port activities for three days this week, the official News Agency  of Nigeria reported Friday.
Lagos has the two biggest ports in Nigeria. The strikers were demanding  higher wages and social insurance, and to come directly under the labour  ministry and not the port administration.
The strike was called off Thursday after a meeting between representatives  of the dockers and the Minister of Transport and Aviation, Ebenezer Babatope,  who promised that government would look into their their demands, the agency  said.
