The State Department Friday brushed aside  reports that the US ambassador to Israel resigned because he was excluded from  Middle East peace discussions.
Citing Israeli press reports, National Public Radio reported that  Ambassador Edward Djerejian, who has served in that post since January 13,  resigned because he was left out of talks between US negotiators and Israeli  Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
State Department Spokesman Michael McCurry said Secretary of State Warren  Christopher had known about Djerejian's plans for some time.
"I wanted to be able to talk to the ambassador directly myself in order to  be able to issue the most categoric denial on his behalf of those  allegations," said McCurry.
McCurry acknowledged that some meetings went on without the ambassador,  but he "has been a very effective, active member of the peace team and had  been included in every aspect of the deliberations underway related to the  Middle East peace process."
In late August Djerejian will head to Rice University in Houston, Texas,  where he will direct the James Baker Institute of Political Studies.
The institute is named after the former secretary of state under former  president George Bush. Djerejian worked with Baker at the State Department.
McCurry said reports Djerejian resigned because he was out of the loop  came from "Israeli sources and others in Tel Aviv, and frankly, those sources  who are just not familiar with the ambassador's thinking have put him in an  uncomfortable position ... he's having to stamp out stories that are untrue."
McCurry added, "because of Ambassador Djerejian's extensive knowledge and  his very shrewd judgement on issues related to the peace process, the  secretary specifically asked that the ambassador be included in all of the  activities of the peace process."
A career diplomat, Djerejian, 55, leaves the department after 33 years of  service. Djerejian notified President Clinton in a May 1 letter of his  resignation.
