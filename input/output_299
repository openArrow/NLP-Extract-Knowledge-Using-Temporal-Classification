The member nations of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC)  exported a total of 14,258 tonnes of tin from January to March -- a volume  26.9 percent below the permitted export tonnage, the association said.
A Bolivian delegate to the ATPC told a meeting of the association that  global tin stocks were "slightly high" but should "fall slightly" later this  year.
The ATPC, which groups the world's major tin producers, is limiting supply  in a bid to trim global stocks.
In 1993, the ATPC said member nations exported 72,469 tonnes of tin, below  the agreed limit of 89,000 tonnes. In ATPC produced 73,268 tonnes of tin in  1993, below the agreed limit of 92,387 tonnes.
China's (new) membership in the association should cause stocks to drop as  that nation "will now effectively comply with the quota put by the ATPC," said  Gonzalo Alvarez.
Elsewhere, the Malyan Mining Employers Association, which groups  Malaysia's main tin mining and smelting companies, said it was considering  disbanding because of the dramatic decline in the country's tin industry.
Weekly stocks on the LME rose 945 tonnes to a record 27,905 tonnes.
