Three people were seriously hurt Sunday when  two parcel bombs went off in and near this Basque city, police announced.
The autonomous Basque police force later closed all the beaches on the  Basque coast, evicting thousands of sunbathers, while they searched for other  devices there and nearby.
The first blast occurred shortly before 10:00 a.m. (0800 GMT) at Muzquiz  where a 50-year-old woman lost a hand when a parcel she had picked up on the  beach exploded. Her 25-year-old daughter suffered burns to her face and chest.
Minutes later a 70-year-old man suffered serious injuries when a bomb  exploded in a staircase leading to a Bilbao restaurant. The man lost both  hands and eyes, medical sources said.
Police immediately cordoned off Muzquiz beach and the area where the bomb  exploded in Bilbao pending a thorough search for possible other explosive  devices.
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks.
