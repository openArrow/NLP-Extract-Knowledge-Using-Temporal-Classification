Meanwhile in Brussels a spokesman for the health ministry said six people  had died of the bug in Belgium since last year.
In all, 17 cases in had been registered in the country since then.
Compared with Belgium's total population of 10 million such a level of  infection could in no way be described as an epidemic, the ministry said,  adding that Belgium's institute of hygiene and epidemiology had since  September 1993 been probing cases of infection by the bacterium.
