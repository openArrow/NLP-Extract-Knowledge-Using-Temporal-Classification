Graham Gooch missed the perfect chance  to gain the psychological upper hand against New Zealand here on Sunday after  throwing away his wicket.
Gooch, recalled to the England side for Thursday's first Test, had hit 42  off only 59 balls when he played a loose shot off Dion Nash and was caught in  the gully.
Essex, chasing the tourists' 428 for five declared, ended the day on 175  for four, with England reject Nasser Hussain unbeaten on 53 at the close.
Earlier Gooch was clearly irritated by the Kiwis decision to bat on until  lunch after beginning the day on 314 for three. That decision doomed the  three-day match to an almost certain draw.
Gooch responded by introducing the spin of Paul Prichard (career record  2-486) after himself sending down an over of gentle medium pace just before  the break.
