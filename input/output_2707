According to Imran, tampering takes two forms, depending on the bowler and  the conditions.
Seam bowlers, he says, use fingernails to make the twine more prominent,  causing it to move more when it strikes the pitch.
Swing bowlers, he says, scratch the ball to speed up the deterioration of  one side.
Imran, who scored 3,807 runs and took 362 wickets in 88 Tests, says:  "Lifting the seam is by far the more common practice. All the greats have done  it at some time in their career.
"If you watch a recording of Jim Laker's 19 wickets against Australia at  Old Trafford in 1956, you'll see him digging his fingers into the ball and  lifting the seam."
But Imran says: "I'm not condemning them because I believe it to be within  acceptable bounds.
"Laws are only laws if they are enforced. If a batsman snicks the ball,  doesn't walk and is given not out, does that make him a cheat?
"If so, most cricketers in the world are cheats."
The ball-tampering row surfaced most notably in the summer of 1992, when  England batsman Allan Lamb accused Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis of cheating.
The ball was changed during the one-day international between England and  Pakistan at Lord's but the TCCB refused to reveal why.
Imran says: "The authorities are unsure how to deal with the problem.
"All it needs is for a strong man on the ICC to reveal what has been  happening and to do something about it."
