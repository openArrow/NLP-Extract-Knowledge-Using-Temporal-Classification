A lion mauled his Romanian trainer to death  during a public show at a circus here, the Al-Qabas daily said Saturday.
The audience fled in panic as Madame Elena, 52, was attacked by the lion  when it angrily clamped her neck in its jaws after tumbling off its podium  onto her during the act.
Her husband Cezar Tipa tried to fight the lion off with a stick, but  failed, the paper added. She had trained the lion for 10 years.
