Russia has instructed its ambassador to the UN to  initiate a Security Council debate on attacks by Bosnian government forces  against Bosnian Serbs, a foreign ministry spokesman said here Thursday.
"Moscow is concerned at reports from different sources over the past few  days" referring to Bosnian government forces going on the offensive in  different parts of the country, spokesman Grigory Karasin told the press.
Russia is "especially concerned by instability as regards the situation  around Tuzla (in the north), of the Moslems' refusal to enter into agreement  on a security zone around Gorazde (in the east) and of heavier firing in the  Brcko zone (in the north) controlled by the Serbs," the spokesman added.
Moscow has instructed ambassador Yuli Vorontsov to "initiate" talks at the  Security Council "to prevent such actions and avoid a worsening of the  situation in Bosnia-Hercegovina," Karasin said.
