irregular. The price of Brent crude North Sea oil declined to below  the 16 dollars-per-barrel Tuesday, which analysts described as a technical  correction after exaggerated highs in recent weeks.
But scarcely 24 hours after this decline, the price swelled to break  through the barrier again, as figures showed a rise in US demand and a cut in  supply from the Gulf states.
Likewise, the situation in Yemen continued to preoccupy traders. The civil  war has caused Canoxy, the largest oil company in the south of the country, to  leave.
Production from the country, estimated at around 320,000 barrels per day,  is expected to be drastically reduced. Because of the fighting, oil tankers  are not approaching the Yemen coast to stock up, a Canoxy spokesman said.
Elsewhere, the London-based Centre for Global Energy Studies (CGES) said  in its latest report that OPEC might decide to raise its production levels in  the last quarter of 1994 if prices continue to rise.
RUBBER: lower. The price of rubber fell, influenced by a slump in  Indonesian rubber prices, Bell More, a dealer for Lewis and Peat said.
Prices were also suffering from a cut in world demand. More said many tyre  manufacturers were coming to the end of their buying period.
The market remained little affected by discussions for the election of a  new stock regulator for the International Natural Rubber Organisation who  would be responsible for regulating world prices.
