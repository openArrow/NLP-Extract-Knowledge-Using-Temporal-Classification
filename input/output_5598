Some 50 people were hurt late Monday when  police dispersed some 400 marchers demanding public housing in the eastern  part of the capital, the privately-run Televisa television station said.
Around 500 police officers were involved in the scuffle in which 40  marchers and 10 officers were injured, the report said.
The demonstration was organized by the Francisco Villa Front to demand  more public housing and the release of three of their members who are  apparently under arrest.
