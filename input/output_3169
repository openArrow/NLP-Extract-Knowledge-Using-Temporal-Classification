Sergio Vieira de Mello, the UNPROFOR civil affairs director in  ex-Yugoslavia, is scheduled to meet Monday with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris  Silajdzic to discuss the application of UN resolution 913 on Gorazde.
Silajdzic, in a television interview Sunday, questioned the UN's  credibility saying that "in terms of Gorazde, where everything had started off  well with a NATO ultimatum, these UN measures were successful in delaying  everything to the point where it has practically become a joke.
"If they are not capable of doing something in Gorazde, how could they on  a larger scale," he said, adding that as a result the Bosnian government would  cautiously enter into the next round of negotiations
