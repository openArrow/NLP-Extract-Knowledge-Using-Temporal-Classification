President Nelson Mandela said Tuesday that South  Africa's new democratic government will apply to rejoin the Commonwealth after  an absence of 33 years due to the previous government's apartheid policy.
Mandela told parliament that the cabinet of his government of national  unity had agreed to ask for membership of the international community of  former British colonies.
"This important community of nations is waiting to welcome us with open  arms," Mandela said.
South Africa left the Commonwealth in 1961 when then prime minister  Hendrik Verwoerd withdrew Pretoria's membership after strong criticism of  apartheid.
