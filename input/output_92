Venezuela's Supreme Court cleared the way Thursday  for a second set of charges to be filed against former president Jaime  Lusinchi (1984-1989), chief justice Roberto Yepez Boscan announced.
The high court found that there was enough evidence to try Lusinchi,a  social democrat, for misappropriation of funds from the National Institute of  Racecourses, an agency to manage racetracks.
The next step would be for the court to ask congress to lift Lusinchi's  presidential immunity, said Yepez Boscan. Lusinchi, like all ex-presidents,  has a lifetime seat in the senate.
The Supreme Court ruled in August that there was enough evidence to try  Lusinchi for corruption in his handling of other state funds. That trial is  now in "judicial limbo," said Lusinchi's lawyer, Morris Sierralta.
Lusinchi is currently in Boston, Massachusetts, according to his attorney.
