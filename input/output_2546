The Italian lower house passed a vote of confidence  in Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's government Friday, lower house Speaker  Irena Pivetti announced.
The outcome of the vote -- 366 votes for Berlusconi's conservative  government and 245 against -- was expected after the premier's Forza Italy,  the federalist Northern League and the neo-fascist National Alliance formed a  coalition following the March 27-28 general elections.
