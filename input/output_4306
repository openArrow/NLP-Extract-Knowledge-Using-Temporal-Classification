Greece on Thursday rejected Turkish accusations  that it has trained guerilla units in the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party  (PKK) to carry out attacks on economic, military and tourist targets.
The accusations were "totally unfounded" and part of a "campaign of  defamation" being waged by Turkey against Greece, Constantin Bikas, spokesman  for the Greek foreign ministry said.
Making the accusations "did not contibute to the normalisation" of  bilateral relations, he added.
Ankara said Wednesday that arrested PKK activists had confessed that a  group of 20 Kurdish militants had been trained in Greece in February to carry  out attacks in Turkey.
The group of 20 PKK militants arrived in Athens from Frankfurt last  February to be trained for bomb attacks on targets in Ankara, Istanbul and  Antalya, Turkey's main Mediterranean spa resort, Turkey said.
The Greek ambassador to Ankara was summoned Wednesday to the Turkish  foreign ministry to explain the affair.
Greece last week rejected earlier Turkish accusations that it had been  training PKK members. Athens "condemns terrorism without reserve," government  spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said, without saying whether the PKK was  qualified by Athens as a terrorist organisation.
In April Turkey protested strongly after Greece allowed the opening in  Athens of an office of the National Liberation Front of Kurdistan, the  political wing of the PKK.
