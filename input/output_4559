A bumper harvest and rising coffee prices are  expected to boost Vietnamese exports of beans to 250 million dollars this  year, a report said here Friday.
This year's crop has produced 150,000 tonnes of coffee, up 20,000 tonnes  on last year, the Vietnam News Agency said, adding that expected exports had  risen by 12,000 tonnes to 140,000 tonnes.
Traders in Singapore said Vietnamese suppliers had been defaulting on  deliveries of around 25,000 tonnes due to the rise in the price of coffee,  which has shot up by 1,000 dollars a tonne since January.
Vietnam expects to increase its area under coffee by around 10,000  hectares (24,000 acres) in the next few years due to rising returns on the  crop but problems with processing, transport and credit arrangements are  hampering the expansion, the official news agency said.
Uncontrolled competition between local traders, whose numbers have risen  from 50 to 80 since 1992, was also hurting growers, the report said.
