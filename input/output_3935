Amnesty International Thursday called on Israel to  release Mordechai Vanunu, the former nuclear technician jailed eight years ago  for giving details of Israel's nuclear program to a British newspaper.
The London-based rights group said Israel, in punishing Vanunu, had gone  "far beyond what is legitimate under international human rights law."
Vanunu, believed to have been abducted by Israeli agents in Italy and  returned to Israel for trial, was convicted of espionage and treason and  sentenced to 18 years in Ashkelon prison.
Amnesty said Vanunu had since been held in solitary confinement, "a  condition that we have long considered to constitute cruel, inhuman or  degrading treatment. The real reason for his continued isolation appears to be  to prevent him from talking about his abduction."
The group said Vanunu should be freed "as redress for violations of his  human rights."
Vanunu has acknowledged releasing Israeli nuclear secrets to a newspaper,  but said he did it as a matter of conscience, to promote public debate on the  program, and not as a spy.
