At least four people were injured and seven  were arrested during a protest Wednesday by disgruntled former employees of  the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), which managed South Africa's first  all-race election last month.
About 300 former election monitors gathered outside the downtown  headquarters of the IEC, which is wrapping up work after the April 26-29 poll,  and demanded bonuses of 7,000 rands (1,944 dollars) for each of the 18,000  monitors employed over the election, the reimbursement of the tax that had  been deducted from their pay and a barbecue.
"We are not a dispenser of largesse," IEC head Judge Johann Kriegler said,  dismissing their demands.
The demonstrators refused to leave the premises, prompting the owner of  the building to call the police.
Four people were injured, some suffering dog bite wounds, when police  forcibly ousted the protesters, the IEC said in a statement later Wednesday.
"Nowhere in monitors contracts had there been any reference to bonuses,"  the statement said, adding that to shell out bonuses would cost the taxpayer  126 million rands (35 million dollars).
The beleaguered IEC was plagued by accusations of disorganisation during  the election and inefficiency during the snail-paced ballot counting process  afterwards.
