China is expected to set up its first gold  market in Shanghai late this year on an experimental basis, the Hong Kong  China News Service said Tuesday.
If the plan succeeds in Shanghai, the Chinese government would later allow  the setting up of several other gold markets in other trade centres, such as  the Shenzhen special economic zone at the border with Hong Kong, the news  agency said.
The measure would be aimed at opening up the country's gold market and an  eventual tie-up with international gold markets, the report quoting the gold  management office of the People's Bank of China said.
China's gold sector in the first quarter of 1994 has suffered losses due  to illegal sales, the China Daily reported on Monday.
Despite a 17 percent jump in output over the same period last year, sales  to the state, unchanged on 1993, were down 35 percent on the first three  months of 1992.
The newspaper quoted Ministry of Metallurgical Industry gold bureau vice  president Cui Dewen as saying that the drop was due to a booming illegal trade  between gold producers and processing factories, which offer higher prices  than the central bank.
Last year, gold sales to the state plunged 40 percent on 1992, the first  fall in 15 years.
The government tried to reverse the trend in September by raising its  purchasing price from 51.2 yuan (8.80 dollars) to 96 yuan (16.70 dollars) a  gram, in line with the world market.
