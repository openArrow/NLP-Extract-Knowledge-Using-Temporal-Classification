Thirty-three Thai and three Malaysian  fishermen have been taken hostage by pirates in Vietnam who have threatened to  blow up their boat if ransom demands are not met, a newspaper reported Friday.
The Utusan Malaysia, a national Malay daily, said in a front-page report  that the pirates held the fishermen on May 5 when they were fishing in  Malaysian waters and demanded a ransom of 110,000 ringgit (44,000 dollars).
A government official told AFP that Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi had  asked the Malaysian embassy in Hanoi to verify the report as well as other  local press reports which claimed the fishermen were being held by Vietnamese  authorities.
