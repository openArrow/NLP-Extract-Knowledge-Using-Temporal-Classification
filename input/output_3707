South African President Nelson Mandela said  late Tuesday he was in the process of holding talks with white right-wing  leaders in order to reach a settlement "which will allay the fears of  everybody".
Speaking in an interview with state-run SABC television, Mandela said he  had already held talks this month with Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen  and with Conservative Party (CP) leader Ferdi Hartzenberg.
He was to hold further talks with Hartzenberg on Wednesday, he added.
"I have to address their fears," Mandela said. "That is what I'm busy  with. It is not sufficient for me to say we have made provision for all  individuals in the bill of rights. One has to enter into negotiations in order  to reach a settlement which will allay the fears of everybody."
The CP boycotted South Africa's first all-race elections held from April  26 to 29, which swept Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) to power in a  government of national unity, on the grounds that the new interim constitution  does not deliver a separe homeland for white rightwingers.
Viljoen's Freedom Front, which is also committed to the establishment of a  "volkstaat", or white homeland, decided at the last minute to contest the poll  and secured 2.17 percent of the vote.
Mandela said it was intended that a "Volkstaatraad", or homeland council,  be established to determine how much support existed from Afrikaners for a  homeland.
If a majority of Afrikaners supported the concept, the new government of  national unity would have to give consideration to their claim "however much  we may think their demand is misplaced".
