South Africa will rejoin the Commonwealth Wednesday  after a 33-year absence resulting from the racist apartheid regime that was  wiped out with last month's first free elections, Secretary-General Emeka  Anyaoku said Tuesday.
He told a press conference at Commonwealth headquarters here that the  return followed "the end of apartheid and the dawn of freedom in South Africa.
"The return of a non-racial democratic South Africa, working alongside the  other 50 members of the Commonwealth, is a boost for the association, not  least in the task of making the world safer for diversity," said Anyaoku.
South Africa dropped out of the Commonwealth by default in 1961, the year  it ended its constitutional monarchy headed by Britain's Queen Elizabeth, and  became a republic.
At that stage, according to Commonweath rules, it would have had to  reapply for admission as a republic and, faced with clear reports that such an  application would be rejected because of apartheid, it chose not to apply.
After Tuesday's announcement, Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister John  Major sent congratulatory messages to South African President Nelson Mandela,  and the British Foreign Office said it was "a gold letter day for the  Commonwealth and for South AFrica."
Anyaoku said the return of South Africa to the fold had brought the  Commonwealth "a very long way toward completeness," but said it was not yet  complete.
"I won't rule out the possibility of one or two other countries joining,"  he said, referring to Fiji and Cameroon, whose applications are pending.
Fiji, a member until 1987, was forced out because of a change of  government and constitution "which ran counter to the basic ethos of the  Commonwealth," said Anyaoku. "I hope and expect that in due course...Fiji will  finds its way back."
