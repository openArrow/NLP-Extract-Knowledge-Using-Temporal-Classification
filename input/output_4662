Twelfth-seeded Mary Pierce was given a standing  ovation by an awed centre-court crowd as she continued to steamroller her way  towards the French Open title at the Roland Garros Stadium here on Friday.
The 19-year-old Canadian-born French hope didn't drop a game and needed  just 58 minutes to brush aside experienced Lori McNeil of the United States  and sweep into the fourth-round of the women's singles.
She will now play South Africa's Amanda Coetzer who defeated Czech  opponent Marketa Kochta 6-0, 6-3.
Pierce, whose game and temperament have blossomed under the wing of new  coach Nick Bollettieri, has so far conceded only two games since the  tournament began.
She is a hot favourite to reach a probable semi-final showdown with  defending champion and world number-one, Steffi Graf.
