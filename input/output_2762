Two young US filmmakers took the top prizes  in the Critics' Week section of the Cannes film festival Saturday, one of them  a first-time feature made for just 27,000 dollars.
The prize for a feature-length film in the section was awarded to the  low-budget "Clerks," by 23-year prize US filmmaker Kevin Smith, while the  short award was given to "Performance Anxiety" by David Ewing.
The Critics' Week is one of the parallel sections of the film festival,  separate from the main competition.
"Clerks," which tells the story of a New Jersey convenience store and the  lives of its customers, is also competing in the Golden Camera section of the  festival, for first-time feature film makers.
The award, accompanied by a 60,000-franc (10,000-dollar) prize, was  announced at a ceremony Saturday evening.
Earlier in the week, Smith took the unusual step of hosting his press  conference for the film in a local supermarket, where he answered questions  from behind a cash till.
Ewing's 15-minute prize-winning film, which presents a surreal cast of  characters who judge a man sleeping with his partner for the first time, is  only his second short.
His prize includes the purchase of his film by the French satellite  television channel Canal Plus, and a 50,000-franc (8,500-dollar) award towards  his next film.
The awards were announced two days ahead of the culmination of the 47th  Cannes International Film Festival with the awarding of the Golden Palm, the  cinema world's most coveted award.
