The militant Islamic group Jamaa Islamiyya said  Saturday it had shot dead three policemen and wounded a fourth in the Asyut  region, a fundamentalist stronghold in southern Egypt.
A statement sent to AFP from the group's armed wing said that Friday's two  attacks were "part of a series planned to revenge the murder" on April 25 of  Talaat Yassin, the organisation's military leader.
It added they were also a warning to those who "killed the martyr Abdel  Hareth Madani" who died in detention at the end of April.
On Thursday the public prosecutor's office said initial autopsies showed  Madani had been tortured to death.
But on Saturday the Egyptian interior ministry said the 32-year-old lawyer  had died from an asthma attack befor he was even questioned about allegations  that he was acting as a go-between for jailed Jamaa members and those abroad.
Egyptian authorities have opened an inquiry into the affair which has been  condemned by the US-based human rights organisation Human Rights/Middle East  Watch.
Two policemen were killed Friday and one wounded when gunmen opened fire  at conscripts guarding a police station in Badari, near Abu Tig, 400  kilometers (240 miles) south of Cairo.
A few hours later another was shot dead as he stepped out of his home in  Abu Tig.
The latest killings bring to 138 the number of policemen murdered since  Islamic militants launched a campaign to topple President Hosni Mubarak two  years ago. The campaign has also cost the lives of 144 militants.
