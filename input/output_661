French Transport Minister Bernard Bosson and his  British counterpart John MacGregor reached agreement Sunday on opening Paris's  Orly airport to flights out of London by the end of June at the latest.
In a joint statement here, the two ministers said they would open the  Orly-London link as soon as possible, and certainly "by the end of June."
It remained unclear whether British carriers led by British Airways would  go ahead with plans to start flights into Orly Monday in defiance of a  continuing landing ban by French authorities.
