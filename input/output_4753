The dollar tried and failed to break through 1.65  marks in Europe on Friday, rising on unexpectedly strong US growth figures,  but falling on profit taking.
After the announcement that figures for US gross domestic product growth  for the first quarter had been revised upwards to three percent from 2.6  percent, the dollar rose to 1.6509 marks but fell later to close at 1.6440  against 1.6415 at the close on Thursday.
Movements had been exaggerated because the volume of trading was thin  before a three-day weekend in Britain and the United States, analysts said.
At Lazard Brothers economist Ian Donald said that the dollar was showing a  habit of being unable to draw lasting benefit from good news.
He held that the levels of German and US interest rates should in theory  push the dollar up against the mark but the strength of the yen prevented it  from taking off.
If the Japanese and Americans agreed on trade issues, the dollar might  rally against all currencies and end the year at 1.75 marks, he said.
Remarks by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan to the senate banking  commission that there was no sign of an increase in US inflation had not  helped the dollar, Donald said. This appeared to rule out further increases in  US interest rates soon.
But he said that in view of the strength of the US economic recovery, he  supposed that the Federal Reserve would have to increase its rates at some  stage during the year.
European currencies rose against the mark in response to comments by  Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer on Bavarian radio that the bank's policy  of pausing in its process of reducing rates applied to the discount and  Lombard rates and not to the repurchase rate.
The mark fell to 3.4168 French francs from 3.42 and to 967 lire from 972.
The drachma remaind under pressure at 150.45 marks against 150.30 before  the weekend.
The escudo also remained week at 104.10 to the mark from 104.05 despite  steps taken during the previous 24 hours by the Bank of Portugal to defend the  currency.
The Swedish krona, which had been weak during the week, rallied to 4.6925  to the mark from 4.7175.
The dollar was at 1.6440 marks against 1.6415 at the close on Thursday, at  104.40 yen against 104.30, at 1.4035 Swiss francs against 1.3995 and was  unchanged at 5.6213 French francs.
Sterling was quoted at 1.5090 dollars from 1.5110, at 2.4808 marks against  2.4803, 157.54 yen against 157.60, 2,1179 Swiss francs against 2.1146 and  8.4825 French francs against 8.4937.
The price of gold rose to 385.75 dollars an ounce from 384.90 dollars.
