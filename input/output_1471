A blast wrecked the third floor offices of US  computer giant IBM in a building in central Athens Tuesday evening, but no  injuries were reported, police said.
A caller who said he was from the November 17 extremist group phoned a  commercial radio station to give a warning a few minutes before the blast in  the Syndagma building.
He said November 17 were going to fire a rocket at the building, although  police could not immediately establish that a rocket had caused the blast.
Police cordoned off the entire area, which includes the Greek parliament  and the new European parliament headquarters.
November 17 has assassinated more than 20 people and carried out around 50  bomb or rocket attacks since it surfaced in 1975 with the murder of US Central  Intelligence Agency (CIA) Athens station chief Richard Welsch.
