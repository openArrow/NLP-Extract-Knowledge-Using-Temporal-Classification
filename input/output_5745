The British government on Tuesday approved a  transatlantic partnership between Britain's Virgin Atlantic airline and the US  giant carrier Delta, worth a potential 100 million pounds a year to Virgin.
The deal, which now only needs approval from the US government to start in  November, will considerably strengthen the Virgin's transatlantic position as  it battles for market share with British Airways and big US airlines.
Virgin is owned by entrepreneur Richard Branson.
"This is an excellent deal for passengers, offering more transatlantic  competition," said British transport secretary John MacGregor, adding that the  announcement followed informal talks with his US counterpart Federico Pena.
"Agreement to the airlines' proposals also demonstrates Britain's keenness  to make progress on the wider Britain-US air liberalisation talks," MacGregor  said.
Under two arrangements known as code-sharing and blocked-space, Delta will  purchase a designated percentage of seats on London-bound Virgin flights from  Los Angeles, New York, Newark, Miami, San Francisco, Orlando and Boston.
Delta will independently price, market and sell these seats, and these  flights will carry Delta and Virgin flight numbers.
Delta will continue to use its own aircraft to offer services from Gatwick  to Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit and Miami.
The agreement will effectively give Delta access for the first time to  London's Heathrow airport -- currently open only to two US carriers --  American and United.
Delta, the third largest US airline after American and United with over  500 aircraft, is the biggest transatlantic carrier. It also has code-sharing  agreements with Swissair, Sabena of Belgium, Aeroflot of Russia and Varig of  Brazil.
