NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner, who is  recovering from cancer, will not chair a meeting of the western alliance's  foreign ministers in Istanbul on June 9 and 10, Woerner said on Tuesday.
In a letter released by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation here,  Woerner said his doctors had warned him against interrupting his convalescence  in Germany "at this very critical phase of my recovery."
"Based on the prognosis of my doctors, I shall return at the end of the  summer holidays to resume my full responsibilities of the secretary-general of  NATO," Woerner said in the letter, which was addressed to NATO ambassadors.
Woerner, 59, has had three operations since 1992 for intestinal cancer.  The third was in January, shortly after he said he had conquered the disease.  His mandate as executive head of NATO expires in 1996.
The Istanbul meeting on June 9 is expected to concentrate on the terms for  Russia's participation in the alliance's partnership for peace programme of  military cooperation with the countries of the former Soviet empire.
Then on June 10 the NATO ministers will meet their counterparts from  countries of the former Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, in the so-called  North Atlantic Cooperation Council.
Woerner had interrupted his convalescence several times over the last  year, particularly last October at an emergency NATO meeting to discuss the  Bosnian conflict.
In February he made a midnight appearance at NATO headquarters here to  announce that the alliance would not bomb Serb positions around Sarajevo  because Serb forces were obeying a NATO ultimatum to withdraw their artillery.
Woerner said his doctors had warned him that these and other premature  returns to work had set back his recovery by weeks or even months.
