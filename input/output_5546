Mormon church president Ezra Taft  Benson, a former US agriculture secretary, died Monday at the age of 94.
Benson became the 13th president of the religious organization formally  known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1985.
The cause of death was not immediately known, church spokesman Don LeFevre  said.
As agriculture secretary under president Dwight Eisenhower for eight  years,  Benson was linked with far-right political groups including the John  Birch Society, and stirred controversy with a program of flexible price  supports.
After leaving government in 1961, he remained active in the church and was  known for his fiery speeches as a member of the Council of the Twelve  Apostles. He was elected to succeed Spencer Kimball, who died in 1985.
Under Mormon tradition, the three-member First Presidency is dissolved  upon a president's death and a new leader is ordained by the council of  apostles.
During Benson's leadership, the 160-year-old church grew to an estimated  nine million members, and Benson focused on doctrinal matters, primarily  promoting the Book of Mormon, the principal scripture of the church.
Church founder Joseph Smith said he translated the scripture from golden  plates he received from an angel. The text tells the story of Hebrews who fled  Jerusalem for the Americas about 600 B.C. and who later were visited by a  resurrected Jesus Christ.
