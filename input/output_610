The nominal leader of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge  guerrillas, Khieu Samphan, called Sunday for nation-wide resistance to  proposals that western nations should arm Phnom Penh government forces.
In a broadcast monitored in Bangkok, Khmer Rouge radio carried an appeal  by Khieu Samphan for "all Khmer residents in rural areas, towns and provinces  as well as abroad ... to defeat the western (arms) plan."
The United States and Australia have said they were considering new  military aid for Cambodia following a plea by King Norodom Sihanouk to save  his country "from the yoke of the Khmer Rouge."
Australian officials said Friday that Canberra, Washington, Paris and some  Asian countries were discussing how to bolster Phnom Penh's ill-disciplined  and poorly-equipped military but no decision had as yet been reached.
Urging all Cambodians "to stand up and undertake whatever action is  required to vanquish the (western) plan," Khieu Samphan said the United States  was the "ring-leader" and that France, Australia and Japan were also involved.
These countries "want to destroy (the Khmer Rouge) and to keep Cambodia  under their influence," he said, asserting that the West was acting now that  Phnom Penh's forces had been virtually defeated.
He noted that the neighboring countries of Southeast Asia were opposed to  any action by the West to arm Phnom Penh troops.
Thai officials notably have urged against new military aid, saying that a  political solution to the continuing Cambodian conflict was preferable.
In Bangkok, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai called for a unified stand by  members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) against foreign  interference in Cambodia.
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and  Thailand.
