Feuding Kurdish factions in northern Iraq  have called a ceasefire and set up a joint body to implement the agreement,  the Iraqi opposition said Saturday.
The Iraqi National Congress said the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and  Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) agreed to separate and withdraw their  forces, implement previous agreements and set up a joint operations room.
The two groups clashed Wednesday and Thursday, despite a May 8 ceasefire  accord following two weeks of violence in which around 100 people died.
Northern Iraq has been under the control of the PUK and KDP since an  uprising against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's army that followed the 1991  Gulf War.
UN aid workers have warned that their operations in northern Iraq could be  halted unless the Kurds stopped fighting.
