A young Palestinian suffered a fatal  gunshot wound by Israeli troops in the occupied West Bank town of Nablus,  Palestinian sources said.
Troops opened fire at stone-throwers, shooting Bashir Zeben, 23, in the  head. He was transferred to a hospital near Tel Aviv but died.
His death raised to 1,270 the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli  gunfire since the December 1987 outbreak of the intifada in the occupied  territories, according to an AFP count.
Earlier on Tuesday, Palestinian Moslem fundamentalists shot dead two  Jewish settlers and seriously wounded a third in an ambush near Hebron,  another West Bank town.
The Islamic Resistance Movement (HAMAS) claimed responsibility for the  attack and said it was in revenge for the 17 Palestinians wounded in clashes  with Jewish settlers and soldiers in Hebron the previous day.
