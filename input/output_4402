President Bill Clinton announced Thursday he  was renewing China's most favored nation trading status for another year and  delinking the trade issue from human rights for the future.
But he said he would impose limited sanctions on Beijing to pressure it to  continue to improve its human rights record.
"I have decided that the United States should renew most favored nation  trading status for China," Clinton said.
"I am moving to delink human rights from most favored nation status. I  believe ... that we have received the end of the usefulness of that policy."  he added.
But Clinton said that while China had made progress in some areas laid  down in his executive order last year conditioning future MFN on its human  rights record, there had not been sufficient progress in others.
In view of the continued abuses, Clinton said he was extending sanctions  imposed as a result of the Tiananmen massacre in June 1989, "in particular the  import of ammunitions and guns."
Clinton had said a year ago that he would not renew China's MFN beyond  June unless it showed significant progress on human rights.
Human rights activists have said China has failed to meet the conditions,  but the business lobby argued that withdrawing MFN and disrupting a 40 billion  dollar trade relationship would be an economic catastrophe.
China warned ahead of Thursday's announcement that sanctions would be  unwise but refused to comment on what retaliatory measures, if any, it might  take.
