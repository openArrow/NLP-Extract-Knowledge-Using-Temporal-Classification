Spain's second-seeded Arantxa Sanchez will play  compatriot Conchita Martinez in the semi-finals of the women's singles at the  French Open here following a 6-1, 7-6 (8/6) win over plucky French opponent  Julie Halard late Tuesday.
Sanchez, winner of the title in 1989 and a finalist two years later, had  to slap back a brave second-set revival by the 24th-ranked French player in  the 1hr 34 min clash.
At one stage Sanchez led 6-1, 5-3 before Halard, cheered on by a delighted  crowd basking in fierce sunshine surged back, forced the second-set into a  tie-break.
Halard managed to save a first match point at 5-6 in the decider with a  superb cross-court volley but Sanchez made no mistake with the second.
The other semi-final will be between defending champion Steffi Graf and  French hope Mary Pierce. Both won their quarter-finals Tuesday in  straight-sets.
