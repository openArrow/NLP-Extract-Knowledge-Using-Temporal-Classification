Some 3,000 people demonstrated here Sunday for  missing Israeli airman Ron Arad, whose plane was shot down over Lebanon in  1986, organizers said.
The rally was called by a support committee for Arad, the only missing  Israeli servicemen in Lebanon still believed to be alive.
"Ron Arad has already spent 2,750 days and night without contact with the  outside world. Respect for prisoners' rights is being flouted," the committee  said.
On May 22, Israeli commandos abducted an Islamic fundamentalist guerrilla  chief, Mustafa Dirani, from his home in eastern Lebanon to help trace Arad.  Israel said he acknowledged holding the airman for two years.
There has been no proof, photographs or videocassette, that the missing  airman was still alive.
