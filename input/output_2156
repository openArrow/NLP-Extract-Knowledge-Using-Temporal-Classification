England, put into bat, had motored along with hardly a care in the world  as Atherton and Stewart tucked into the new ball.
Hopes of a high-scoring contest were put on hold, however, when Stewart  got too greedy, too soon, and dashed altogether after lunch as wickets fell  steadily.
Stewart, having timed the ball to perfection on his way to 24, hoisted an  inviting short delivery from Chris Pringle into the hands of Dion Nash at long  leg.
The loss of their most destructive stroke-maker, and the introduction of  spinners Hart and Shane Thomson, changed the picture considerably for England.
Unsettled by a delivery from Thomson that spun sharply, Robin Smith fell  tamely to the same bowler soon after, edging an attempted cut.
Captains past and present, Graham Gooch and Atherton, nudged their way to  a half-century stand.
But when Gooch was bowled off his pads by another Thomson turner, a dour  struggle became inevitable.
Atherton, having hit eight boundaries in his 137-ball innings, was  eventually run out by Crowe's direct hit, and then Pringle helped himself to  four more wickets and one-day best figures of five for 45.
Hick fatally tried to hit across the line, Dermot Reeve miscued an  attempted swing to leg, Steve Rhodes was comfortably held in the deep after  crunching a straight six and Lewis was bowled by the last ball of the innings.
