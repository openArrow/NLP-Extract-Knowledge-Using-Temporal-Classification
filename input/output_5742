Former New Zealand Test coach Tony Gordon has taken  charge of English Rugby League first division club Hull.
Gordon, who has been given a one-year contract with a two-year option, had  been coach of second division London Crusaders since February 1993 and came  within a point of taking them to promotion this season.
He failed to agree terms for next season with London's new owners,  Brisbane Broncos, and now replaces Australian Royce Simmons at The Boulevard.
Hull chairman David Latham earlier denied a report he had first offered  the job to Australian Steve Anderson, currently the assistant at Gold Coast  Seagulls.
Latham said: "Somebody from the club spoke to Steve Anderson but he hasn't  had a formal interview with us."
