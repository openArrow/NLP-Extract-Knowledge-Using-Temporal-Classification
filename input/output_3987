The first former Socialist party minister to  be tried for corruption denied Wednesday accepting kickbacks prior to Italy's  April 1992 elections, judicial officials said.
Appearing in court for the first time, ex-foreign minister Gianni De  Michelis denied charges that he had accepted around 70 million lire (42,000  dollars) in cash from businessman Giuseppe Pisante, an administrator for the  Acqua group.
He told the court: "I always took responsibility for receiving (party)  contributions from businessmen, but in this case the question does not apply."
De Michelis added that he had never met Pisante, who earlier said he had  met the former minister on one occasion.
De Michelis is also one of 32 leading figures from Italy's political and  commercial establishment due to stand trial for corruption from July 5 in  connection with the high-profile Enimont scandal.
Enimont was a failed merger at the end of the 1980s between state energy  concern ENI and the private Ferruzzi-Montedison conglomerate. An estimated 100  million dollars in bribes to political parties were paid out during its  abortive formation.
Other defendants in the case include Northern League leader Umberto Bossi,  whose movement is part of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's governing  coalition, and former prime ministers Bettino Craxi and Arnaldo Forlani.
