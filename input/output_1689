Syria and Israel are still far apart over moves  towards peace after US Secretary of State Warren Christopher's latest Middle  East mission, Syrian presidential spokesman Gebran Kurieh said Wednesday.
"The results of Mr. Christopher's talks in Israel show that there are  still wide differences because of the Israeli position on the principles of  peace," he said.
Christopher left for Egypt on Wednesday after a second round of talks with  President Hafez al-Assad, when he briefed the Syrian leader on his talks with  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.
Israel has offered a withdrawal from the strategic Golan heights over  several years in return for total peace, but the Syrian official press on  Wednesday rejected any phased handover.
The Golan has been the main stumbling block between Israel and Syria since  the launch of Middle East peace talks in October 1991.
Negotiations between Syria and Israel have been suspended since the Hebron  massacre on February 25 when a Jewish settler killed 30 Arab worshippers.
