Alexander Solzhenitsyn's eldest son, Yermolai,  arrived Wednesday in Vladivostok from Seoul, two days ahead of the writer who  returns to his homeland after 20 years in exile, ITAR-TASS reported.
Yermolai, a Harvard graduate, is currently living in Taiwan and will  accompany his father, mother Natalia and brother Stepan on their journey  across Russia to Moscow.
The Solzhenitsyns were to spend a few days in the port city to meet local  people including fishermen and sailors of the Pacific fleet before boarding a  train across Siberia and the Urals.
Local officials were quoted by ITAR-TASS as saying that no special  security measures were planned, stating that local police forces will ensure  order during Solzhenitsyn's visits in the city.
Meanwhile, local people in the surrounding towns and cities of Nakhodka,  Ussuriisk and Arseniev have invited Solzhenistyn and his family to visit but  it was not known if the writer would travel to those areas.
The regional administration of Primorskoye has also offered to put up the  Solzhenitsyns in a luxurious dacha reserved for international conferences and  official ceremonies but the writer has declined to stay there.
The family will stay at a local hotel.
The Nobel Prize winning author was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1974  after his epic work "The Gulag Archipelago", an expose of the horrors of  Soviet labour camps, was published in France and the United States.
Solzhenitsyn was to leave his home of Cavendish, Vermont Wednesday and  travel to Anchorage where he will board an Alaska Airlines flight to  Vladivostok.
The flight will make a stopover in Magadan, a center from which political  prisoners were sent to the Kolyma gold fields, and to the far east city of  Khabarovsk.
