A handful of films are left in the running  for the Golden Palm, due to be awarded here Monday, Cannes film festival jury  member Kazuo Ishiguro said Friday.
In an interview with AFP, Japanese-born Briton Ishiguro also said that as  far as he was concerned, the winner would be a film which would appeal to the  "enthusiastic amateur."
"On Monday I suspect it will come down to a handful. I can't speak for  other members of the jury, but as you watch the films in competition certain  ones eliminate themselves as you go along," he said.
He said he was judging the films "as a kind of enthusiastic amateur ...  the questions I'm asking are does it move me, do I find it funny, sad, does it  bore me."
Ishiguro is on the 10-member jury which has been viewing two or three  films a day since last Wednesday, judging each ahead of the awarding of the  Palm on Monday evening.
As a member of the jury, Ishiguro was not allowed to comment on the  chances for individual films. However, a small number of the 23 films entered  in competition have begun to emerge as frontrunners with the critics.
"Three Colours Red," by Poland's Krzysztof Kieslowski, seems to have the  most consistent support, while "To Live" by Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou and  Italian Nanni Moretti's "Dear Diary" are following close behind.
