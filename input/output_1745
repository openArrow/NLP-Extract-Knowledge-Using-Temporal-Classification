Turkey on Wednesday warned Iraqi Kurds against  cooperating with Kurdish rebels after Turkish warplanes attacked a rebel base  in north Iraq in the second such cross-border raid this year.
Foreign ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman said Turkey would not remain  neutral if either of the two Kurdish movements in Iraq started cooperating  with Turkey's separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
Nineteen aircraft took part in Wednesday's raid and eight bombed the camp,  110 kilometres (70 miles) from the border and 500 kilometers (310 miles) from  airforce bases in east and southeast Turkey, according to military  headquarters here.
All planes safely returned to base, but there was no immediate word on  casualties.
A first cross-border air raid at the end of January was described by the  military as their biggest air strike against the PKK rebels in the 10 years of  the movement's separatist insurrection.
At the time military officials said the Zaleh base which was manned by  1,600 PKK rebels had been wiped out.
In a warning to Kurdish movements in Iraq foreign ministry spokesman  Ferhat Ataman said Wednesday that Turkey had so far remained neutral in rows  between Iraq's Democratic Party of Kurdistan and Jalal Talabani's Patriotic  Union of Kurdistan.
"Should one of these two movements cooperate with the separatist  organization (the PKK), it will no longer be able to continue this  neutrality," he added.
Ankara suspects Talabani of tolerating and even fostering PKK activities  in Iraqi Kurdistan and notably in areas under the control of Patriotic Union  fighters, according to Kurdish sources in Ankara.
Ataman said Turkey was concerned about the instability in north Iraq but  would stick to its non-interventionist policy.
Government officials meanwhile said 86 PKK fighters had been killed since  Monday in security force operations in southeast Turkey, where Kurds are the  majority of the population.
Officials enforcing emergency regulations in the region said a large amount  of weapons had been captured.
The army has stepped up sweeps since the end of March in a major push to  finish with the rebels once and for all, according to official briefings.
