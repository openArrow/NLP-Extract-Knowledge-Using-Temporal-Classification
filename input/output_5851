The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) is to submit a  project to restructure the United Nations and make it more democratic,  according to a draft resolution issued here Tuesday.
NAM heads of state will propose a restructuring plan to the United Nations  at their next summit in September 1995, coinciding with the 50th anniversary  of the United Nations.
The draft resolution under discussion by NAM foreign ministers said the  changes should be based on "the principles of democratization ... in the  United Nations and all its agencies."
"Ministers took the view that the United Nations should be restructured to  take into account the significant changes that have taken place," it said.
"Membership of the Security Council should be expanded on democratic  principles, with regard to the various proposals by developing countries for  representation in the Council."
NAM, meeting in Cairo until Friday, considers the United Nations the  "chief vehicle" through which it can participate in the shaping of the new  world order following the end of the Cold War.
The organisation also aims to consolidate the position of developing  countries and give them "more negotiating power vis-a vis the developed  industrial nations."
