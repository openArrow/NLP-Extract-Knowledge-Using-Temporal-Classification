Popular support for Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata's cabinet dropped to 51.6 percent this month, down 5.2 percentage points  from an April poll conducted just after its formation, a poll by the Yomiuri  newspaper showed Wednesday.
The disapproval rate for the Hata cabinet stood at 34.2 percent.
But his current level of support is still the fourth-highest recorded  since Yomiuri started conducting the polls in 1964, the nation's largest paper  said, adding that the poll shows the public still holds high expectations for  the coalition government.
Of those who support the Hata cabinet, 36 percent said they thought it  would try new ideas; 32 percent said the cabinet was better than the previous  LDP cabinet and 25 percent said Hata seems trustworthy, according to the poll.
Of the detractors, 42 percent of them cited as reasons for disapproval  that the premier "does not hold real power," indicating criticism of the  influence of Ichiro Ozawa, co-leader of Japan Renewal Party which Hata heads,  the daily said.
The cabinet of Hata's predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa, who ended the Liberal  Democratic Party's 38-year grip on power in August last year, scored the  highest approval rating of 71.9 percent in September 1993.
It was followed by the cabinet of Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka in October  1972 with 60.5 percent and that of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa in November  1991 with 55.7 percent, it said.
The weekend poll was conducted by the Yomiuri covering 3,000 eligible  voters nationwide, of whom 70 percent responded.
Another weekend poll published by the Tokyo newspaper Wednesday showed the  approval rating for Hata's cabinet at 54.3 percent, also the fourth-highest on  record among the daily's polls on cabinets soon after their formation.
