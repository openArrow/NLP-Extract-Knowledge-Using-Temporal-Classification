Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on Friday  hailed the "historic step toward a new Middle East peace" born of recent  Israeli-Palestinian accords.
"It's a solid track, a one-way track, and I don't think there can be a  going back on what was achieved," he told the Royal Institute of International  Affairs before leaving for a meeting with US counterpart Warren Christopher in  Geneva.
Moussa said he was optimistic that "Arab-Israeli peace seems to be  attainable," that there was "a possibility to reach a settlement that would  give both Arabs and Israelis a sense of security."
The future of the Middle East would be determined, he said, by four  factors: Israel's withdrawal from territory it occupied after the 1967 war,  guarantees of security for all sides, normalized relations between Israel and  Arab nations, and political rights for the Palestinians.
"If we can really achieve that, then the prospects for the Middle East are  there," he said. "The Israelis have started to feel cohabitation is possible.  On the Arab side, Israel is no longer the enemy."
The Israeli-Palestinian accords on Gaza and Jericho were only "a first  step," said Moussa. "The second would be autonomy in the totality of the West  Bank."
He cautioned against over-optimism, and "exaggeration in the demands of  this or that side.
"Security must be for both sides," he said. "They have to prove they are  able to live together side by side as neighbors."
