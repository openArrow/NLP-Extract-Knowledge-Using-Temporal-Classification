Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Friday that the United States  is not seeking confrontation with North Korea but will defend South Korea  against any aggression from Pyongyang.
"Confrontation is emphatically not our preferred path," Christopher said  in a speech to the Asia Society in New York.
"US forces stand shoulder to shoulder with those of our ally, South Korea,  to deter and defeat any agression by the North."
Christopher said that if North Korea persisted in its nuclear ambitions  the price would be "continued isolation, economic hardship and pariah status."
But if North Korea abandons plans to acquire nuclear weapons "and does  not otherwise undermine peace in Northeast Asia," it could become part of the  international community," he added.
