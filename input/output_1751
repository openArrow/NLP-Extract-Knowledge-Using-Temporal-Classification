About 1,500 defence factories will go bankrupt in  the next two months, putting 7.5 million people out of work, a leading  industrial lobbyist said Wednesday.
Arkady Volsky, head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs, also called for an "economic state of emergency" and said his  lobby group would present next week a series of urgent measures to the  government to curb the drastic fall in production.
He was quoted by ITAR-TASS news agency.
Industrial output has fallen about 25 percent in the first quarter  compared to last year and about 5,300 factories have already stopped  production, according to the economics ministry.
Volsky warned that massive unemployment could lead to social unrest, in  particular in the many one-industry towns across Russia.
