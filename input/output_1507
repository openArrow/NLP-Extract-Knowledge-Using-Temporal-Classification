Cambodia's Khmer Rouge guerrillas Wednesday  dismissed Hanoi's call for border negotiations with Phnom Penh, saying the  boundary between the two countries was internationally recognized in the 1960s.
In a broadcast monitored in Bangkok, Khmer Rouge radio demanded that Hanoi  "return all Cambodian territory, whether on land or sea, that was seized or  occupied" since the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia in 1979.
Boundaries were set forth on 1/100,000-scale maps in 1933 and 1953 and  recognized by the international community, including Vietnam, in the 1960s,  the radio said.
Hanoi now wanted to negotiate border disputes with Phnom Penh in order to  give legal weight to its "seizure of thousands of square kilometers of  Cambodian territory between 1979 and 1990," the radio said.
On May 13, the foreign ministry spokesman in Hanoi said Vietnam was  prepared to negotiate border disputes "on the basis of mutual respect,  independence and sovereignty."
He was responding to charges by Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk, in an  interview with the Far Eastern Economic Review, that Vietnam had moved border  markers and was digging canals inside Cambodia.
The 1,130-kilometer (700-mile) frontier has been a bone of contention  between the two states since France left Indochina in the 1950s, with fresh  allegations that Vietnam expanded its claims during the 1979-1989 occupation.
