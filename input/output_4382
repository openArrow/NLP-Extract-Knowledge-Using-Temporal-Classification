Bulgaria's Prime Minister Luben Berov won Thursday a  confidence vote from lawmakers by 125 votes in favour to 95 against with one  abstention, parliamentary officials said.
Berov, 68, demanded the confidence vote to give him the mandate to  implement the programme of his non-party interim government until general  elections scheduled for the autumn.
Last Friday, parliament rejected a proposed cabinet reshuffle, put forward  by Berov, by 116 votes to 108.
The government, which came to power in December 1992, is following a  programme of land reform and privatisation and attempting to maintain price  controls and to finalize an agreement with the London Club of international  creditors on halving Bulgaria's 8.7 billion dollar debt.
President Zhelio Zhelev, parliamentary speaker Alexander Yordanov and all  parties here are agreed on the need to hold general elections ahead of the  normal parliamentary term, which ends in 1995.
Early elections are expected to be held in October or November.
