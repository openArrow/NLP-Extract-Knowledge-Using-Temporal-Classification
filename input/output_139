Boris Yeltsin's communist and nationalist opponents  have agreed to devise a joint action program against the Russian president  when they hold a national meeting at the end of May, press reports quoting  communist party leader Gennady Ziuganov said Thursday.
Yeltsin's arch-rival, former vice president Alexander Rutskoi who was a  leader in the bloody October 1993 hardliners' revolt against Yeltsin but was  freed from prison in February, also called for the opposition to unite, saying  "strength lies only in unity," according to the reports.
The two spoke at a public meeting Thursday night involving a handful of  other movements linked since last February in a coalition called Understanding  for Russia.
Ziuganov and Rutskoi, who last week called for the "overthrow" of the  Yeltsin government, repeated their aim to take over power in Russia by the  50th anniversary next year of the end of World War II in Europe, which is  celebrated on May 9 in Russia.
Rutskoi said the next Victory in Europe day will be "celebrated without  the regime now in power."
Rutskoi told the meeting he favored a takeover of power "in stages." He  said he would wait until the term of the present legislature, to end in  December 1995, before preparing himself for the presidential election.  Yeltsin's current term runs out in June 1996.
Rutskoi also criticized the absence of any joint ceremonies by Russians  and its World War II Western allies to mark the departure of their troops from  Germany.
He said this was the "price of the dwarfish foreign policy led by Boris  Yeltsin and Andrei Kozyrev," his foreign minister.
