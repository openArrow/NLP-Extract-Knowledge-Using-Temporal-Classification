The third fragment of Polish director  Krzysztof Kieslowski's multi-hued trilogy was coloured in Monday with the  Cannes premiere of "Three Colours Red."
But Kieslowski, presenting his sequel to "Blue" and "White" in competition  here, insisted that the three films were presented as individual episides  rather than as a unified whole.
He said he "simply told three stories ... If people find something else in  the three films, it's really a present for me."
The latest offering, premiered on the fourth full day of the 47th Cannes  International Film Festival, returns to the mood of the first part of the  trilogy.
The heroine, played by Irene Jacob, develops a strange relationship with a  hermit-like old man whose dog she runs over in her car. Amid her own romantic  turmoils, the relationship develops into an obsession.
The culmination reunites characters from the previous two parts of the  trilogy, who are washed up as survivors from a ferry accident, apparently  based on the 1987 Herald of Free Enterprise disaster in the English Channel.
Explaining his cinematic philosophy, which produced the multi-part  Decalogue series before "Three Colours," Kieslowski said: "If I make several  films at a time, I can illuminate a wider field.
"Life is not an assemblage of parts, or fragments. For me it is essential  to put more fragments (together) to understand better," he said.
