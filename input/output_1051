French objections to Russian sales of cheap  uranium held up a decision by European Union foreign ministers here Monday to  sign a new trade, cooperation and partnership accord with Russia.
But diplomats predicted that the agreement would be wrapped up in mid-June.
The Greek chairman of the EU council of ministers, Theodoros Pangalos,  said it might be signed by EU leaders and Russian President Boris Yeltsin at  an EU summit on the Greek island of Corfu on June 24 and 25.
The accord would give Russia better access to western European markets and  open up the prospect of a Russia-EU free trade area after 1997 if Moscow  implements market reforms.
It also recognises Russia as an economy in transition towards a free  market, rather than state-controlled. This concession tranlates into better  trade terms.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe blocked the agreement on the grounds  that it would favour Russian exports of cut-rate uranium to the EU, where  France has 60 percent of the market.
Juppe insisted that nuclear fuels should be excluded from the accord, at  least until it had won more favourable terms from Moscow. He is due in Moscow  later this week to discuss the issue.
But diplomats suggested that the French objection was tactical and  temporary, aimed at placating the influential French nuclear industry.
EU Trade Comissioner Sdir Leon Brittan said: "I'm delighted at the  reception given by our proposals on nuclear and banking. The agreement is  effectively resolved and I am confident it will be agreed in June."
The accord has been held up for more than a year by Moscow's insistence on  incorporating nuclear fuels, and on restricting the operations of foreign  banks in Russia.
In a gesture to France, the European Commission has proposed that the EU  retain the right to curb surges of cheap imported Russian uranium.
The EU executive has also accepted Russian insistence that foreign banks  should be allowed no more than 12 percent of the Russian banking system's  capital -- at least until a review after five years.
An EU diplomat reported a general sentiment at Monday's meeting that Russia  would not budge and that the deal was the best that could be got.
The EU ministers also gave their approval to the signature of a similar  trade, cooperation and partnership agreement with Ukraine, which was  initialled in March.
Diplomats said Ukrainian President Leonard Kravchuk might sign the accord  with EU foreign ministers at a meeting in Luxembourg on June 14.
They said he had asked for the signing ceremony to be held ahead of a  Ukrainian presidential election at the end of June.
