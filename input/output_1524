Japan is expected to accept numerical targets in the  field of government procurement to revive stalled trade talks with the United  States prior to July's Group of Seven (G7) summit, newspapers said Wednesday.
During planned talks starting Thursday in Washington, the Japanese side is  expected to propose setting "some criteria" to gauge Japanese government  procurement of various products, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said.
Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice minister at the international trade and industry  ministry, and Sakayuki Hayashi, deputy foreign minister for economic affairs,  are due to discuss the stalled trade talks in Washington on Thursday.
The proposal is considered the first compromise toward restarting  negotiations deadlocked since February after talks broke down between US  President Bill Clinton and then prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa.
"It appears that the US side will concentrate on negotiations in  government procurement," a senior international trade and industry ministry  official said.
"It is possible that we will have to make drastic decisions to realise an  increase in our procurements from overseas," he said.
Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa hinted at a compromise earlier this week,  saying Japan "might show some numerical gauges over government procurement."
Clinton and Hosokawa's predecessor Kiichi Miyazawa agreed in July last  year to hold wide-ranging talks in various sectors to reduce Japan's huge  trade surplus with the United States.
But Japan has refused to accept numerical targets as part of the  "objective criteria" which both sides agree is needed to monitor progress in  the three sectors of government procurement, automotive trade and financial  services.
The government procurement talks cover computers, supercomputers,  satellites, medical technology and telecommunications.
