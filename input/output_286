German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's center-right  coalition drafted a bill Friday making it a crime punishable by up to three  years in prison for anyone to deny that the Holocaust took place.
Members of the coalition said they would present the bill to the  Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, next week so that it could be voted  into law later this year.
Denying that the Nazis murdered millions of Jews in death camps during  World War II is currently not a crime in Germany, although numerous courts  have punished culprits by convicting them for inciting racial hatred or  defaming the dead.
But the federal court of justice, Germany's highest court, ruled in March  that denying that the Holocaust existed did not amount to inciting racial  hatred.
The ruling sparked widespread outrage with Ignatz Bubis, a leader of the  Jewish community in Germany, saying that it amounted "to a handbook on how to  deny Auschwitz existed without being punished."
Bubis at the time also called for the adoption of a law specifically  making it a crime to deny the Holocaust.
The government of former chancellor Helmut Schmidt, a Social-Democrat,  attempted in the 1980s to adopt such a law but dropped the issue as neo-Nazis  sympathies were not on the rise at the time.
The tide has changed, however, in recent years with Germany increasingly  becoming the focus of international attention because of a rise in xenophobia  and racially motivated attacks on foreigners.
