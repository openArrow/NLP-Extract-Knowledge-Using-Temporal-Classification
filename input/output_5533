Human rights violations will in future be able to  be faxed directly through to the United Nations by victims, their relatives,  or non-governmental organisations, following the establishment Monday of a  special fax hotline.
The "human rights hotline" will be open around the clock, to enable the  United Nations to respond immediately, explained UN High Commissioner for  Human Rights, Jose Ayala Lasso, who announced the move at his organisation's  Geneva headquarters.
Lasso also announced the creation of a special bank designed to hold  donations for the activities of human rights committees and stressed new and  more efficient fundraising methods had to be found "to make use of ever more  meagre resources."
