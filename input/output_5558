Haiti's army-backed government pledged  Monday not to allow the reorganization of the Tonton Macoutes, the feared  private militia that kept order through intimidation for decades here.
In a statement issued by information minister Jacques Saint-Louis, the  government said the Haitian constitution prohibits any armed organization  aside from the army and the police.
The Macoutes, whose name became synonymous with savagery under the regimes  of Francois "Papa Doc" Duvalier and his son, Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier,  promised last week to reorganize to protect against a possible invasion by the  United States.
The militia formally known as the National Security Volunteer Corps  included as many as 300,000 members before the group was dissolved in February  1986 by the military government after Baby Doc Duvalier was ousted.
Saint-Louis said that interim president Emile Jonassaint -- whose  government is not recognized internationally -- would not change the decree  banning the Macoutes by former military ruler Henri Namphy in 1986.
US President Bill Clinton has refused to rule out military action to  restore Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the democratically elected president ousted in  a September 1991 coup, if economic sanctions fail to work.
A United Nationas embargo against Haiti covering all but food and medicine  took effect May 21 in a bid to force the military to relinquish power.
