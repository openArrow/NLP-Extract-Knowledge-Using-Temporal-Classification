A disgruntled Prince Charles, heir to the British  throne, has been landed with a 160,000 pounds (240,000 dollars) annual bill  for his estranged wife Diana's "grooming", the Daily Mail said Wednesday.
The 3,000-pounds (4,500 dollars) a week account is believed to cover some  of Princess Diana's clothing, casual wear for her sons, her alternative  therapy treatments, make-up, hairdressing and some gifts.
Costs of her private holiday travel arrangements are also included.
A Kensington Palace source told the Mail: "She has made it pretty clear  around here that it will never be allowed to get that high again. Staff have  been urged to advise on areas where cuts can be made, and they are already in  place."
