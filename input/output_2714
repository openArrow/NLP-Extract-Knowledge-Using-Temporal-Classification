Allison Fisher of England confirmed her status  as the world's best woman snooker player by winning her seventh world  professional title here Saturday.
The 26-year-old Fisher reeled off the final five frames to defeat  third-seeded compatriot Stacey Hillyard 7-3 in the best-of-13 frames final  here and make it three-in-a-row in the world championships.
Fisher picked up the winner's cheque of 7,500 dollars while Hillyard  received 2,500 dollars.
The players were tied 3-3 after the morning session before Fisher went  into overdrive, her run to victory including a break of 102 in the sixth frame.
"The match was closer than the final scores suggest and I am pleased it's  over," said a jubilant Fisher after receiving her trophy from former Indian  cricket captain Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi.
"It was the toughest final I have played in and only some good shots in  the end helped me win.
"Stacey has always been a strong competitor so the victory is even more  satisfying," she said, adding her aim was to win 10 world titles.
Hillyard, whose lone world title came back in 1984 at the age of 14,  complemented Fisher's consistency in tense situations.
"I missed a few easy balls when it mattered and that set me back a bit,"  Hillyard said. "Fisher was very dominant in the second session and deserved to  win.
"But I felt pretty good out there and am reasonably pleased with my  performance over the last three days," said Hillyard, who defeated  second-seeded Karen Corr in the semi-finals.
