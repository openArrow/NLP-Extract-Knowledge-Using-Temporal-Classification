South Korea on Saturday urged North Korea to  immediately stop the controversial refuelling of a nuclear reactor, warning  that the situation could degenerate into a crisis.
"The (South Korean) government strongly urges North Korea to immediately  stop removing the used fuel rods ... and carry out its obligations related to  nuclear safeguards of the Non-Proliferation Treaty," the foreign ministry said  in a statement.
"The government expresses a deep regret and concern," added the statement,  which observErs describe as being unusually devoid of rhetoric.
The statement came after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  said North Korea had resumed refuelling at a five-megawatt nuclear reactor,  threatening to make a full accounting of weapons-grade fuel impossible.
The statement said the government, in close cooperation with itS allies,  was exerting "all diplomatic efforts" to persuade the North to stop the  refuelling and accept the IAEA's demands.
