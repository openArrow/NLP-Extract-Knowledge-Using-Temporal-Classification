A bashful Hong Kong graduate of Canada's McGill  University is giving his alma mater eight million Canadian dollars (5.8  million US) to build a new engineering building, its principal said Tuesday.
David Johnston declined to name the mystery donor, saying a promise of  anonymity had been made by the university.
But he told reporters it was likely the building would be named in the  benefactor's honor when it opens in a few years' time on the university's  campus in downtown Montreal.
Nearly 700 graduates of McGill University live in Hong Kong, including  Chye Kuok, whose father Robert Kuok is one of the territory's wealthiest  tycoons and a confidant of top Chinese leaders.
Others are Anna Pao Sohmen, daughter of the late shipping magnate Sir Y.K.  Pao, and Edward Leong, a prominent doctor who represents the medical  profession in the Legislative Council.
The mystery donation represents two-thirds of the 12 million Canadian  dollars (8.7 million US) McGill University has gathered so far in Hong Kong as  part of its 200 million dollar (145 million US) fund-raising drive.
Several thousand Hong Kongers hold degrees from universities in Canada,  which remains the most popular destination for emigrants from the British  colony in the run-up to Chinese rule in 1997.
