Vietnam has no immediate plans to devalue its  currency, at present worth 10,955 dong to the US dollar, one of Hanoi's  central bankers said Tuesday.
Le Van Chau, deputy governor of the State Bank of Vietnam, scotched  speculation that the dong might be devalued by 30 percent as Hanoi continues  to liberalize the state-dominated economy.
"It is not true ... we will not depreciate our currency in the years to  come," he told reporters, adding that Hanoi would continue to regulate the  dong's value "so that it is more in line with the market."
Chau spoke during a day-long seminar between Hanoi government officials  and Hong Kong-based businessmen looking to invest in Vietnam.
He is among a delegation of 20 officials that will proceed to San  Francisco and Washington on Tuesday to become the most important Vietnamese  trade delegation ever to go to the United States.
Leading the delegation is Vice Premier Tran Duc Luong, whose private  itinerary in Hong Kong will include a meeting on Wednesday with Governor Chris  Patten, a Vietnamese official said.
The United States lifted a sweeping trade embargo on Vietnam earlier this  year, but has yet to agree to the establishment of diplomatic ties with Hanoi,  19 years after the end of the Vietnam war.
