The upbeat Hungarian Socialist Party (HSP) wants  a coalition government even if it wins an absolute majority in a final round  of legislative voting on May 29, party leaders said Sunday.
"We would want to set up a coalition government because that would serve  the country better," said party head Gyula Horn, 61, who got up from his  sickbed for the first time Sunday to attend an HSP election committee session  after sustaining serious injuries in a car accident ten days ago.
His party won 32.9 percent of votes in a first round ballot on May 8.
But Horn, foreign minister in the last communist government until 1990,  also told the election committee that the socialists would govern on their own  if no other political force was ready to join them.
"We would rather rule alone than arrange new elections, because the  country could not bear the tension of a new vote," he said.
Pollsters say the HSP has a good chance of winning a parliamentary  majority in the second round.
And only the orthodox communist Labour Party, and the runner-up liberal  opposition Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), which won 19.4 percent in the  first round, have so far signalled their willingness to join a coalition.
The SZDSZ has its own candidate for the premiership, Gabor Kuncze, and  expressed opposition to Horn being nominated for the post.
The HSP said it would not discuss coalition possibilities before the  second round, Horn said after Sunday's meeting, adding that his party would  not accept preconditions from prospective coalition partners.
The HSP committee reiterated that a socialist-led government would support  the rights and aspirations of Hungarian ethnic minorities in neighbouring  countries, said Laszlo Kovacs, the party's foreign spokesman.
