Twenty-three members of a wedding party were  killed when an improvised tractor-trailer in which they were travelling broke  into the path of an express train in north India, state-run TV said Sunday.
The accident occurred in the district of Gonda in Uttar Pradesh state on  Saturday when the vehicle was trying to negotiate a railway crossing.
The death toll rose from 19 overnight when four died in hospital,  television said. Thirteen people were injured, six seriously.
The tractor was pulling a trailer packed with people on their way to a  marriage in the bride's town.
The bridegroom was travelling in a jeep that had safely crossed over the  tracks before the improvised vehicle -- a favourite form of mass transport in  the northern Indian countryside -- met with the accident.
In the southern district of Bellary on Monday, the bride and 33 wedding  revellers died when an overloaded boat on which they were having a "joy ride"  sank in the Tungabhadra river.
