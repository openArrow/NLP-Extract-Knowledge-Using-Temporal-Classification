Iranian state radio blasted Saudi Arabia Wednesday  for its silence over the death toll in a stampede during the Mecca pilgrimage,  saying the incident cast doubt on Riyadh's ability to stage the ceremony.
"With a little planning the Saudis could have prevented the tragedy," the  radio said.
"The event highlights the incompetence of a government which thinks of  itself as the guardian" of the holy site in Mecca.
The radio accused the Saudis of "being incapable of providing safety" for  millions of Moslems who make the pilgrimage each year.
Iran's Kayhan daily, quoting its correspondents in Mecca, reported that  700 people, including six Iranians, had been trampled to death in the stampede  on Monday during a ritual known as "stoning the devil" in Mina.
Witnesses said that more than 200 pilgrims, mainly Asian and Africans died  in the incident, while Indonesian officials put the toll at 252.
Saudi officials have yet to disclose an official figure, but authorities  said the overall number of deaths in the whole pilgrimage was 829.
A record 2.5 million Moslems from around the world participated in this  year's pilgrimage, known as the "hajj," which every Moslem is expected to make  once in his lifetime if he can afford it.
