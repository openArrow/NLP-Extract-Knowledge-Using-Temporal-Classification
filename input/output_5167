Nottingham Forest sacked former Scottish  international Archie Gemmill from its coaching staff here on Sunday.
Gemmill still had a year of his eight-year contract to run.
Manager Frank Clark said: "I have decided the time is right to bring in a  new face and I hope to make an appointment within a week."
Forest's talented young defender Vance Warner is recovering in a Tenerife  hospital after contracting meningitis on an end-of-season club tour.
Clark said he had been assured Warner would make a full recovery.
