China Tuesday conditionally agreed to discuss the  murders of 24 Taiwanese tourists on a mainland pleasure boat with Taipei, but  authorities in Taiwan have rejected the offer, officials here said.
The agreement follows nine requests from Taipei over the boat fire and  murders on Lake Qiandao in eastern China on March 31, after the incident  caused a diplomatic spat between the two governments.
A total of 32 people were robbed and murdered before the boat was set  ablaze by the raiders. Four people have been charged with robbery, mass murder  and arson in connection with the incident.
Taiwan requested the talks to discuss compensation for the families of the  victims and protection of Taiwanese travelling in China.
The Beijing-based Association for Relations of the Taiwan Strait (ARATS),  in a letter faxed to its Taiwanese counterpart, the Straits Exchange  Foundation (SEF), said the Chinese side would agree to a special meeting, SEF  officials said.
But any talks must include issues concerning Taiwanese investment disputes  in China, and the issue of the Taiwanese navy's firing on Chinese fishermen  when their boats come into Taiwan's territorial waters, the letter said.
