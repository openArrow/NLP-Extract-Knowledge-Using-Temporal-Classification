British troops faced stiff resistance at Sword  beach, the furthest beach to the east on D-Day.
The 3rd division, the 27th tank brigade, the 101st Beach Sub Area and  Royal Marines embarked against heavily fortified German positions in the dunes.
The Brits -- a total of 28,845 eventually landed -- were aiming to open  the way to the port of Ouistreham. They also were assigned, as the fighting  progressed that June 6, to help out paratroopers from the 6th division who  were under heavy fire at a beach-head on the Orne River.
But they faced the 21st Panzer division, the only Panzer division the  Nazis had on the Normandy front. The 21st joined up with the German 716st  infantry division to block the route to Caen, the Normandy capital that was  one of the principal goals of D-Day.
Among the British forces was the only French commando unit to take part in  D-Day, the 177-strong 4th commando. It included many Breton sailors as well as  Normandy residents.
A member of the team, Albert Lerigoleur, recollected in a newspaper  interview that while the Bretons, from a region to the west of Normandy, did  not know where they were to land, the Normands had recognized the Caen coast  from models of the landing sites shown during briefings.
"But they said nothing (before the landing). Secrecy was the rule,"  Lerigoleur recalled.
