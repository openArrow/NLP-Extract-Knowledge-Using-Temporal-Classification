PLO leader Yasser Arafat said here Wednesday that his  recent call for a Moslem holy war should not be construed as hostile to Israel  but rather an appeal to strive for complete Middle East peace.
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who had said he would query Arafat  on the remark, walked into an Arafat press conference as the PLO leader was  giving his explanation. The two men shook hands and Peres took a seat at  Arafat's side.
They were here for ceremonies honoring Norway's role in brokering the  Israeli-PLO peace agreement.
Controversy flared Tuesday when Israeli radio broadcast what it said was a  speech given by Arafat May 10 in a Johannesburg mosque in which the  Palestinian leader called on Moslems to "take part in a jihad (holy war) to  liberate Jerusalem." Arafat was in South Africa for Nelson Mandela's  inauguration as president.
Arafat said here Wednesday that his comments had been misunderstood.
Speaking in English, he said, "it seems that they are trying to squeeze me  with false means."
He said that after praying at the Johannesburg mosque, "the worshippers  asked me to make a religious speech" and he insisted that his use of "jihad"  was a religious phraseology.
"For your information," he told reporters, "we can say, 'I will continue  my jihad to achieve peace' in an Islamic, in a religious way. We can say 'I  will continue my jihad to do my work well, til I will be able to bring  Christians, Moslems and Jews to play together in Jerusalem.'"
He insisted: "Some extremists have changed the religious terminology into  a political terminology. It is not my fault."
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin had warned earlier Tuesday in Israel  that if Arafat's remarks were confirmed, it "calls into question the peace  process."
Rabin warned at a press conference with visiting US Secretary of State  Warren Christopher that Israel would "not accept such violations and continue  the process." Christopher said he endorsed Rabin's statement.
Wednesday's official agenda said Arafat and Peres would take part in the  inauguration of a sculpture offered to the Norwegian people for their  contribution to the Middle East peace process.
Oslo hosted secret meetings in 1993 that started off contacts between the  two parties after 45 years of war. The contacts culiminated in last  September's agreement granting limited autonomy to the Gaza Strip and the West  Bank town of Jericho.
Twenty-seven years of Israeli military occupation ended Wednesday as Peres  and Arafat were here to thank Norway.
