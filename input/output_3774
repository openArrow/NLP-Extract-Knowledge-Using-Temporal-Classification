Burmese Moslem rebels have killed 11 Burmese  government soldiers and injured 15 others in an ambush in a renewed guerrilla  campaign against the military regime, a rebel statement said here Wednesday.
The soldiers were killed when a Burmese army patrol was ambushed last week  in Fansi village, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Buthidaung township  in Arakan province, according to a statement faxed by the Rohingya Solidarity  Organisation (RSO) to AFP.
The RSO, one of several Moslem guerrilla groups fighting Burmese  government forces, said in a bid to achieve its goal the organisation has  "recently geared up jihad (holy war)" in Arakan.
It claimed that nine "powerful" bombs were set off in Maungdaw township  recently along with armed attacks on government troops.
The statement said Burmese forces operating in southern Maungdaw have  forced 20,000 Moslem villagers to carry military equipment and have used them  as human shields in operations against the guerrillas.
No independent confirmation was available.
