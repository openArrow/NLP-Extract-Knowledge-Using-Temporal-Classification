Chilean army chief and former president General  Augusto Pinochet arrived in Prague on Monday, where he is expected to discuss  possible arms deals, CTK agency said.
Pinochet flew in from Amsterdam for a private visit of several days on the  invitation of Omnipol, a company specialising in arms exports.
CTK originally said he drove in from the Netherlands but eyewitnesses at  the airport saw the army chief, wearing a grey suit, welcomed into the VIP  lounge while at an airport terrace demonstrators unfurled a banner saying  "assassin, where are our brothers who are missing?"
Diplomatic sources quoted by CTK said Pinochet would be discussing the  possible purchase of armoured vehicles.
He is expected to remain in the country until June 4 and visit an arms and  military equipment show, IDET, opening on Wednesday in Brno.
