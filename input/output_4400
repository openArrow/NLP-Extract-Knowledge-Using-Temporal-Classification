Pole-sitter Al Unser Jnr and  reigning champion Emerson Fittipaldi took confidence but little else from  Thursday's final practice session for Sunday's Indianapolis 500.
Cool and windy conditions kept speeds low and provided poor preparation  for expected hot race conditions. Teams tested equipment but were cautious.
"We just wanted to put some miles on the car, make sure there were no  leaks and get ready for Sunday," Unser said. "This is as confident as I have  ever been at Indy."
Retiring Mario Andretti, preparing for his 29th Indy start, had the  fastest lap of the two-hour session at 223.708 mph, followed by Scott Brayton,  Fittipaldi and Nigel Mansell above 222 mph (355 km/h).
"It was a good speed for me," Fittipaldi said. "I was running full fuel  tanks most of the time so I was pleased."
Fittipaldi had been the speed leader in practice, but was forced to  qualify in hotter conditions than Unser. That helped Unser win the pole  position on the inside of row one while Fittipaldi is on the outside of row  one.
While Fittipaldi predicts a tight race betweeneight or nine racers, Unser  gives Fittipaldi the favorite's label.
"The number one guy now is Emerson," Unser said. "He is everybody's main  competitor. I was fortunate to get a break in qualifying, but under equal  conditions, Emerson has finished strongest."
Mechanics on Jacques Villeneuve's car won the annual pit-stop contest  Thursday with a time of 12.867 seconds, defeating the crew of John Paul in the  final. Every instant counts when cars complete a lap around the 2.5-mile (4  km) oval in just over 40 seconds.
Canada's Scott Goodyear returned to the starting lineup for the race when  owner Kenny Bernstein replaced qualified Davy Jones. Goodyear did not practice  Thursday and will start last in the 33-car field.
