England named a near full strength  line-up for the second match of their South African tour, picking 14 of the  players that did duty for England in the final five nations match against  Wales.
The team to take on Natal Saturday consists of David Pears, Rory  Underwood, Will Carling, Phil de Granville, Tony Underwood, Rob Morris, Dewi  Morris, Jason Leonard, Brian Moore, Victory Obogu, Nigel Redman, Martin  Johnson, Tim Rodber, Ben Clarke and Dean Richards.
After Wednesday's embarrasing defeat at the hands of a fired-up Orange  Free State, England coach Dick Best said: "I have already identified the  problem areas which will have to be rectified within the next few days of  training."
The players are reported to be still smarting from referee Pierre  Lombard's lineout decisions.
"We were not allowed to compete in the lineouts as we are used to back  home," team manager Jack Rowell said.
Former England flanker Tony Neary said the England test line-up will boast  a much better pack.
Natal have made four changes to the side that lost to Queensland in the  Super 10 final: New Zealander Kevin Putt takes over as scrum-half from  Springbok Robert du Preez, Mark Andrews comes in to bolster the pack and  Justin Enslinn comes in on the right wing for injured James Small. The other  change is still to be named.
