Singapore would welcome the North America Free Trade  Agreement (NAFTA) being extended to include Singapore, Prime Minister Goh Chok  Tong said in an interview published Tuesday.
Goh said that while there has not been any official proposal from the  United States, he would welcome NAFTA being extended to countries "across the  Pacific, including Singapore and South Korea."
He made the comments in an interview Monday with Nihon Keizai newspaper  president Takuhiko Tsuruta.
But he said that if NAFTA were only extended to Singapore and South Korea,  there would be problems. The trade accord should be open to other Asian  countries, Goh said.
In the same interview, Goh also expressed Singapore's opposition to  linking  human rights to economic issues.
The United States is pressing China to improve its human rights situation  as a precondition for extending its most favored nation trade status.
"We see human rights from a perspective different from the West, which  emphasizes human rights over group rights," Goh said. "Singapore and most  parts of Asia think that group rights should prevail over individual rights."
Goh said Singapore considered it necessary for the United States to remain  in Asia for regional security.
There are two strong powers in Asia, Japan and China, he said. "If the  United States leaves Asia, there would be two sumo wrestlers left in the ring,  with each trying to prove itself the champion."
