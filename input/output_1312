Iran has declared a port city in the Caspian Sea a  free-trade zone, the official news agency IRNA reported.
The decision was announced by President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjnai on  Monday, during a tour of Bandar-e-Anzali, it said.
IRNA said the city in northern Gilan province had a potential to serve as  a "key trade link to other countries bordering the sea" -- namely Azerbaijan,  Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Russia.
Bandar-e-Anzali is the fifth region in Iran to be declared a free-trade  zone after Qeshm and Kish (on the Gulf), Chah-Bahar (on the Oman Sea) and  Sirjan in the southern Kerman province.
The Iranian parliament voted last year to set up special social, customs  and trade regulations to govern the zones, and it also called for a lax visa  requirement for foreigners.
But it did not say whether foreign investors were allowed to own more than  49 percent of any venture, as has been the rule in the mainland.
Iran set up the free-trade zones to boost exports and attract foreign  investment and modern technology, but the plan has so far failed and the  regions have been used as platforms for importing luxury goods.
