China has appointed 13 more members to its  Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) -- Beijing's shadow policy-making body in  Hong Kong.
The PWC is charged with mapping out Hong Kong's post-1997 political system  in conjunction with top Beijing officials led by Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.
The latest appointments, which include businessmen, former government  officials, and academicians from Hong Kong, were made Thursday after the  seventh meeting of the Standing Committee of China's National People's  Congress in Beijing, the semi-official China News Service said.
They included businessman Paul Cheng, chairman of Inchcape Pacific, a  subsidiary of British-owned Inchcape PLC, and former chairman of the Hong Kong  Chamber of Commerce, Wong Ying-wai, former deputy trade and industry  director-general, and Arthur Garcia, a former government ombudsman.
New PWC members from the Chinese side included Guo Fengmin, the Chinese  team leader of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, and Wulan Mulun, the  deputy director of Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong.
Beijing has now handpicked 141 advisers from the territory to help it  prepare for the transfer of sovereignty in 1997.
Beijing set up the PWC and advisory bodies after Governor Chris Patten  ignored Chinese objections and pushed ahead with political reforms for Hong  Kong ahead of 1997.
