Talks aimed at finalising a ceasefire agreement in  the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh broke down here Tuesday after both  sides failed to agree on a final document, Interfax reported.
The agreement brokered by Russia provided for an immediate ceasefire to be  followed by the deployment of military observers and 1,800 troops from the  Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in the conflict zone.
