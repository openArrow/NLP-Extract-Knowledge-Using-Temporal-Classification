A strain of deadly mutant bacteria that destroy  human flesh and can kill in hours claims about 20 lives in Germany every year,  a spokesman for the German health agency (BGA) said here Wednesday.
Between 30 and 40 cases of the gangrene-like infection, necrotizing  fasciitis, which has claimed nine lives in Britain so far this year, are  reported in Germany every year and about half of the patients die, said Gernot  Rasch.
No exact figures of the total caseload are available as the disease need  not be reported to health authorities, Rasch added on the sidelines of a  medical convention held in the German capital.
He said necrotizing fasciitis, which is caused by a strain of  streptococcus-A bacteria believed to be genetically transformed into a killer  microbe by a viral attack, was treated with antibiotics.
In The Hague, the Dutch public health ministry meanwhile said the bacteria  had killed 21 people in the Netherlands in the last 18 months.
The ministry said sufferers were scattered across the country and that the  situation was under control.
