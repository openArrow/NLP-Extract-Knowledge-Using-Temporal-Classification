Doubts over the Argentine Grand Prix have  apparently been cleared up by constructors' chief Bernie Ecclestone.
Marcos Gastaldi, chairman of the firm which operates the track, said the  FOCA president had confirmed the race would go ahead on Oct 16.
The uncertainty was caused by work to refurbish the track and arguments  over the financial package.
