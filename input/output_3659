Disgraced former British athletics  chief Andy Norman bounced back here on Tuesday when he was granted an agent's  licence to represent athletes competing abroad.
Norman, sacked as promotions director last month, was granted his licence  by the British Athletic Federation.
Dismissed for spreading false rumours of sexual harrassment about  journalist-coach Cliff Temple who later committed suicide, he was forced to  make the application after it was discovered he had been negotiating  appearance money for top athletes without official approval.
A Federation statement said: "Mr Norman has applied to BAF to become an  authorised athletes' representative under its rules.
"Permission has been granted for Mr Norman to act as a representative to  British athletes competing abroad."
BAF spokesman Tony Ward said: "Andy is an experienced operator who  successfully handled athletes for the Federation."
Norman, who has acted for Linford Christie, Colin Jackson and Sally  Gunnell in the past, said: "There have been some misunderstandings, but I  don't see any problems now."
Under the deed of covenant, he is unable to act for the athletes at  British meetings.
