Weekly stocks slumped a massive 24,975 tonnes to 399,725 tonnes on the  London Metals Exchange.
LEAD: slightly lower. Prices varied little throughout the week, as the  market concentrated on the rise of copper and to a lesser extent nickel.  Prices ended the week five dollars lower at 494 dollars per tonne.
Figures from the International Lead and Zinc Study Group showed mining  production had slipped 7.9 percent in the first quarter on a cut in North  American production.
Consumption of refined lead likewise reached 1,119 million tonnes during  the first quarter of 1994, a three-percent rise -- although producer stocks  reached 217,000 tonnes.
Weekly stocks on the LME lifted 4,600 tonnes to reach a record 350,325  tonnes.
ZINC: slightly higher. Prices ended the week 10 dollars higher at 989  dollars per tonne, after breaking through the 1,000-dollars-per-tonne barrier  when it followed copper higher.
It was also boosted by figures from the International Lead and Zinc Study  Group.
These showed that refined zinc production was virtually unchanged in the  first quarter of 1994 at 1.381 million tonnes compared with the same period a  year ago, the steady down-trend in mined production continued with a 6.8  percent year-on-year decline to 1.266 million tonnes in the first quarter.
"Within the complex zinc has one of the worst set of current fundamentals  but great-looking future fundamentals," said analyst William Adams from Rudolf  Wolff.
Continued falls in mined production are eventually expected to impact the  refined market as smelters run short of feed.
Weekly stocks on the LME rose 5,500 tonnes to a record 1,162,850 tonnes.
