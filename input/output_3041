Tom Lehman, who let the Masters get away from  him in the final round last month, made no such mistake Sunday as he marched  to a record-breaking five-shot victory in The Memorial golf tournament.
Lehman carded his fourth straight 67 on the Muirfield Village Golf Club  course for a 20-under total of 268.
That was three shots beter than the course and tournament record of 271  set by Hal Sutton in 1986.
"My whole game plan was to torch the front nine, go for every pin," Lehman  said. "I wanted to try to lap the field."
Australian Greg Norman was second with a 64 for 273. He birdied three of  the last four holes to claim the runner-up spot, three shots ahead of John  Cook who had a 71 for 276.
"Hey, I played the best golf I could play," Norman said. "He just beat us."
Tournament founder Jack Nicklaus, who designed the course, echoed the  words Bobby Jones addressed to him 19 years earlier when he said Lehman  "played a game with which I am not familiar."
Lehman, his voice breaking as his eyes filled with tears, said: "It is one  of the greatest days of my life."
Lehman, who birdied the third, the birdied three in a row from the  seventh, led by seven shots until Norman's closing flourish.
"I've been close a few times, more than a few times, before," he said.  "I've made a career out of beating myself, three-putting from 15 feet, making  a stupid bogey, not getting up and down, something.
"This time, I didn't beat myself. I kept myself under control, mentally  and physically. I'm very, very pleased."
