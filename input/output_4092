The former leader of China's 1989 pro-democracy  demonstrations, Wang Dan, called on the government Thursday to overturn its  official condemnation of the movement and release all protestors who remain  behind bars.
"We believe that the government's ruling that the 1989 movement amounted  to chaos and counter-revolutionary rioting is unfair. This ruling must be  revised as soon as possible," Wang said in a petition addressed to the  standing committee of the National People's Congress (NPC).
Six other dissidents involved in the Tiananmen Square movement also signed  the document.
The petition also calls on the the release of "all those who are still  detained because of their role in the 1989 movement" and "compensation for  relatives of the June 4 dead, and help for former prisoners returning to  society."
The pro-democracy movement began on April 15 and mobilised millions of  Chinese before being crushed by the People's Liberation Army in central  Beijing on June 4 1989.
According to an official version of events, 300 people died. Dissidents  and observers who were present said several thousand were killed.
Wang's petition said: "This movement was a popular, patriotic and  democratic movement, based around students. We were reasonable and non-violent  throughout."
"We believe that the June 4 incident is like a 'knot' in the history of  the Chinese nation. Today we are at a key moment in reform and opening, and,  like the government, wish to have stability," the text, released to the  foreign press, said.
The document highlighted the need to promote social stability, build a  democratic system and ensure social progress.
"We must undo this knot," it said. "This is why we sincerely wish that the  government will take a wise step and take into account the interest of the  nation and the future of the state."
"We have never forgotten this event, and we firmly believe that this  movement has played a highly important role in the history of our country."
"On the occasion of the fifth anniversary, we exercise our political  rights as citizens to issue these public appeals to the standing committee of  the PNC, the supreme organ of state," it said.
The petition was signed by Wang Dan, Ma Shaofang, Zhai Weimin, Shao Jiang,  Li Hai, Zheng Xuguang and Guo Haifeng.
According to a report released this month by the group Human Rights  Watch/Asia, several hundred people are still in prison after being detained  during the crackdown.
