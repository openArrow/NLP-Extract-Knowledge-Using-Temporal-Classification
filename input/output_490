English football legend Bobby Charlton could  become national coach to Sierra Leone, according to the sports minister of the  west African state, Charles Mbayo.
Mbayo announced on Saturday he had sacked all the coaching staff of the  national squad "with immediate effect", following their first round  elimination from the African Nations Cup finals in Tunisia during March.
"Leone Stars' performance fell hopelessly short of expectations," Mbayo  said, adding: "It was a national disgrace and severe blow to our pride.
"It is time to rehabilitate our national pride and restructure the team  for future participation."
The minister announced an "arrangement to secure the services of former  England captain, Bobby Charlton who is expected here in two weeks' time".
The side had previously been coached by Egypt's Mohamed Mustapha Abdel  Ghali and Sierra Leone's Obi Metzger.
