UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali  said Wednesday that he would request a second term in the position at the end  of 1996 if he is healthy.
"The question will be raised in 1996 and it will depend on my own physical  capacities," Boutros-Ghali, 71, said.
"If I am feeling in shape, quite honestly I'll say yes. But on the other  hand, at the end of two and a half years, if I dont feel well enough then I  won't request a second term," he said.
Boutros-Ghali became UN Secretary-General on January 1, 1992 and his  mandate expires on December 31, 1996. He is from Egypt.
