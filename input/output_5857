Pete Sampras' dream of a fourth consecutive Grand  Slam title turned into a nightmare on the treacherous red clay of the Roland  Garros centre-court here on Tuesday.
The world number-one, winner of last year's Wimbledon, United States Open  and this year's Australian Open, was beaten in four sets by his old buddy and  rival Jim Courier in a big-hitting quarter-final duel spread over nearly three  and a half hours on the hottest day of the tournament so far.
Courier, who grinded out a 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, 6-4 win, now plays defending  champion and sixth seed Sergi Bruguera in Friday's semi-final -- a repeat of  last year's final.
The 22-year-old Spaniard, beat dangerous fourth-seeded 19-year-old rival  Andrei Medvedev 6-3, 6-2, 7-5, despite a first-set injury to his right thumb.
"I felt something after a volley and when I looked down I saw the skin had  come off and it was bleeding. I had some spray on it and it was OK after that.  It looked worse than it was," said Bruguera.
In the women's singles Steffi Graf and French teenager Mary Pierce didn't  disappoint organisers, fans or ticket touts. They raced to the  potentially-explosive semi-final everybody wants to see and which is sure to  pack the centre-court.
It was a case of 'anything you can do I can do better' as the two players  charged through their quarter-finals.
Defending champion Graf, chasing her fifth consecutive major title, saw  off Argentina's Ines Gorrochategui -- the girl they are calling the new  Sabatini, 6-4, 6-1 in just 66 minutes.
Pierce went even faster. She needed nine minutes less to overwhelm  Austria's Petra Ritter 6-0, 6-2 and become the first French player since  Francoise Durr in 1973 to reach the last-four of the event.
Durr was the last home player to win the title -- in 1967.
