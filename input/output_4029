Crimean President Yuri Meshkov on Wednesday  welcomed as "encouraging" a compromise on the autonomous republic's future  reached a day earlier in Kiev by Ukrainian and Crimean negotiators.
A crisis blew up in Crimea Friday after the republic's Simferopol  parliament voted Friday to adopt a 1992 constitution seen in Kiev as  tantamount to a declaration of independence.
The compromise Tuesday was "a search for mutual understanding in bilateral  relations," Mechkov told the ITAR-TASS news agency, adding that the  negotiations represented a "start towards resolving the problems."
"The confrontation that certain forces in Kiev have tried to provoke in  Crimea has failed," Mechkov said.
"However, Kiev is pursuing a policy aimed at destroying the executive  power structures in Crimea and destabilising the situation in the republic,"  he said.
Both sides agreed Tuesday to refrain from any new measures which might  aggravate the situation.
Crimean deputies agreed not to enforce Friday's resolution.
And the Ukrainian parliament agreed to hold fire on its own resolution  passed Friday declaring the Crimean move illegal and giving the local  legislature until Monday to reverse its decision.
Russian and Ukrainian presidents Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk agreed  in a telephone conversation Monday that the Crimean situation was an internal  Ukrainian affair, the Interfax news agency said.
Late Wednesday, the Russian presidency issued a statement advising  Russians that it was safe to holiday in Crimea this summer.
"The Crimea is a favoured holiday spot," and despite "the artificial  creation of a pre-conflict atmosphere" the situation "gives no grounds for  concern," the statement said.
