Algeria's new legislative assembly on Tuesday  chose its president, Abdelkader Bensaleh, the former spokesman of an official  commission responsible for trying to end a bloody uprising by political means.
Officials said that Bensaleh, the government's candidate for the post, was  elected in the National Transitional Council (CNT) unopposed by a show of  hands after two other candidates stood down.
He had been spokesman for the National Dialogue Commission, a body set up  by the army-backed government in a bid to find a political solution among  parties after Algeria plunged into guerrilla warfare waged by Moslem  fundamentalists against the authorities early in 1992.
The CNT, installed by President Liamine Zeroual on May 18 as a  transitional legislative authority, held its first plenary session on Monday  to set its own parliamentary rules.
In coming days, it is due to debate the programme of Prime Minister Mokdad  Sifi's government.
Twenty-two seats of the 200 in the CNT remain vacant, since the body has  been boycotted by the former sole, ruling National Liberation Front, the  Socialist Forces Front of Hocine Ait Ahmed and the Rally for Culture and  Democracy, led by Said Sadi.
These parties are at odds with the government over its policies,  particularly on how to deal with Moslem extremists, who launched their violent  campaign after the cancellation in January 1992 of a general election the  Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win.
Of the remaining seats, 73 are occupied by politicians, 85 by  representatives of labour unions and professional bodies, and 30 by members of  the administration.
Bensalah was three times elected to the former single-party national  assembly dissolved in January 1992, where he chaired the foreign affairs  commission. He also headed the foreign ministry's communication and  documentation department and was director of the government daily Ech-Chaab.
