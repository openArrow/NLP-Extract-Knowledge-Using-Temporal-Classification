The deputy president of the territorial assembly,  Tinomana Ebb, and the minister of labour and solidarity, Raymond van  Bastolaer, have been thrown out of the Pupu Here Aia party here, the party  said Friday.
The president of the party, Jean Juventin, said the two men had carried on  "activities contrary to the interests of the party."
Juventin's party is the second largest faction in the government.
The move comes two days after a mini cabinet reshuffle which saw the  creation of a new portfolio, environment minister, and observers believe it  could lead to more changes.
