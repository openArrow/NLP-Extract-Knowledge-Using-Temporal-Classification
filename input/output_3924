Vietnam's industrial production increased by 12.1  percent in the first four months of this year compared with the figure for the  same period in 1993, the government's statistics department announced on  Wednesday.
The growth was most notable in the centralized state sector, which rose by  13.7 percent. Local state industries grew 10.5 percent and the private sector  increased 9.7 percent, according to official statistics.
Crude oil production was up 20.8 percent, cement 15 percent, electricity  9.6 percent and coal 4.3 percent.
The department said that the increase in production is due mainly to price  stability and the development of local products in a market which has been  dominated by foreign competition.
But industries still suffered from a lack of capital investment, and  officials say Vietnam needs 45 to 55 billion dollars for its development  through 2000, it said.
