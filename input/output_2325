Fundamentalist gunmen shot dead two Israeli  soldiers at a petrol station on the edge of the Gaza Strip on Friday, the  Islamic Jihad claimed.
The group said in a statement sent to news agencies that it carried out a  "heroic" operation near the Erez border crossing before dawn.
Several fighters from the Jihad's Kassam unit had used American M-16 and  Israeli Galil rifles in the attack.
The petrol station is just inside the settlement zone controlled by  Israeli forces on the northern edge of the Gaza Strip.
Islamic Jihad has vowed to fight on against Israeli occupation despite the  autonomy agreement in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho.
Fundamentalists from the Islamic Resistance Movement HAMAS shot dead two  Israeli settlers south of Hebron on Tuesday.
The claimed attack would the first killing of Israeli settlers since  Israel and the PLO signed an accord on May 4 to launch autonomy.
