Calling land mines a threat to many developing  countries, a US official said Friday that Washington will lead a worldwide  effort to remove the devices blamed for thousands of deaths and injuries each  year.
Thomas McNamara, a senior State Department official in charge of  politico-military affairs, said it would be extremely difficult to ban mines,  since they are not considered illegitimate weapons as is the case with  chemical or biological weapons.
But McNamara told a Senate panel that Washington will sponsor a conference  this year or next to raise funds for deactivation of land mines around the  world.
"Land mines have become the weapon of choice in many developing  countries," McNamara said.
"Land mines pose a significant impediment to achieving our foreign policy  objectives in many regions of the world," he added.
President Bill Clinton has urged the Senate to ratify an international  treaty restricting the use of land mines, whose victims are often civilians.
The Senate panel received written statements supporting the restrictions  from UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and former US president Jimmy  Carter.
"Every month, at least 1,200 people, mostly innocent civilians who have  nothing to do with any war or conflict, are killed or maimed for life by these  tiny, silent explosives," said Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, who led the  hearings.
