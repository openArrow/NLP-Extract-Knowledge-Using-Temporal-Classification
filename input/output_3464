Fast as he is, even Mario Andretti  cannot outrun Father Time.
A racing era concludes in Sunday's Indianapolis 500, the 29th and final  start here for the 54-year-old driver.
"In the mind, reality has to set in," the Italian-born racer said. "I'm  not as good as I used to be. But I'm still satisfied I can be a factor and  still run with the boys up front at this stage in my career."
Andretti's retirement after this season, combined with last week's  retirement of four-time Indy winner Al Unser and last year's departure of  veteran A.J. Foyt, ends an era of longevity unmatched in racing.
"These guys are the stuff of legends," former series and Indy 500 champion  Bobby Rahal said. "It has been fantastic to race against Mario, Al and A.J. I  always considered Mario the yardstick. If I finished ahead of him, I knew I  had done something."
Andretti, in his 41st racing season, has run alongside his son Michael and  former Formula One champion Nigel Mansell for the Paul Newman-Carl Haas team.  He has talked of becoming an owner and working with his son.
"There are mixed feelings," the younger Andretti said. "I'm glad he is  retiring like he wants but it's sad because it's his last Indy. He's a legend  here. We'll miss him."
Andretti's 52 Indy-car victories are the most of any active driver and he  also owns series career records for poles, laps led and starts. He was the  first racer to win Indy-car and Formula One titles, but had just one victory  in the past five years.
"When I reached 50, I thought every year from then would be a bonus,"  Andretti said. "I'm trying to savor every venue and Indy has tremendous  meaning. I'm trying to enjoy each day."
