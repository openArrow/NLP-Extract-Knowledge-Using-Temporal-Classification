Robbers stole at least 72 automatic pistols  and 14,000 rounds of ammunition in a raid on the headquarters of the Gamboma  military zone in central Congo, military sources said here Tuesday.
A team of army and police officers was Tuesday sent to Gamboma, 300  kilometres (185 miles) north of Brazzaville, to investigate the theft, which  took place on Sunday night, the sources said.
Gamboma is one of the strongholds of Congo's opposition coalition. At the  beginning of this year, opposition militiamen stole large numbers of weapons  and quantities of ammunition from the non-commissioned officers' training  school there.
President Pascal Lissouba then said a senior army officer had been an  accomplice to the crime, but did not name him.
