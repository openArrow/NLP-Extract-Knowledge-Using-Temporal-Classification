One of Hong Kong's best loved couples were  spending Monday night apart -- one behind bars for biting a workman, the other  at the territory's smartest address.
Whisky, the male half of Governor Chris Patten's Norfolk terrier duo, was  taken away in disgrace by the authorities after he bit a 21-year-old workman,  while his mate Soda waited behind, officials said.
The three-year-old will spend seven days in government kennels under  observation for rabies, then, if given the all clear, will be sent back home.
Patten, currently in London for talks, was informed of the mishap and sent  a get-well-soon message to the worker, the officials said.
This is not the first time the governor's dogs have made the news.
Last year Soda went missing while on a walk and Whisky was eagerly  photographed by the local media pinning for his mate.
The furry duo have since been regular favourites of the public.
