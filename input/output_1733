English football's double winners, Manchester  United, will hear an unwelcome echo of their season's darkest moment on Friday.
The Michael Bell-trained two-year-old, Cim Bom Bom, which makes its debut  at Hamilton, takes its name from the victory chant of Turkish club  Galatasaray, who knocked United out of the European Cup.
The Dowsing colt's Turkish owner, Yucel Birol, mistakenly believed he was  having a joke at Bell's expense when he named it.
Bell said: "He knew that I supported a Manchester-based football team.
"The joke back-fired, though, because I'm a City fan and it was too late  to change the name!".
