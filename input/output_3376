Top US trade officials met here Monday on the  sidelines of US-Japan trade talks aimed at ending a deadlock over opening  Japanese markets.
President Bill Clinton's chief economic advisor Laura D'Andrea Tyson said   there would be an announcement Tuesday but refused to comment on whether this  meant the two sides had resolved the differences in their bilateral trade  negotiations.
Senior US economic and trade officials gathered in the office of US trade  Representative Mickey Kantor after the seventh US-Japan meeting since Thursday  to try to break the deadlock.
Japanese deputy foreign minister for economic affairs Sakayuki Hayashi  said as he left the seventh session that there could be a further meeting  before the end of the day and he hoped that the talks could be finished before  Tuesday.
The two sides are trying to agree on ground rules for resuming trade  negotiations which collapsed in February in a disagreement over how to measure  progress in opening Japan's markets and reducing its 60 billion dollar trade  surplus with the United States.
An official at the Japanese Embassy said the talks could go on as late as  midnight.
