Michael Schumacher, who has won the first  four races of the season, was head and shoulders above the field in his  Benetton-Ford as he won pole position here Saturday for the Spanish Grand Prix.
He was joined on the front row by Damon Hill of Britain in a  Williams-Renault. Hill had been third fastest in the first qualifying session  on Friday.
Mika Hakkinen of Finland, who lost his place on the front row to Hill, was  third-fastest in a McLaren-Peugeot.
J.J. Lehto of Finland, in a Benetton-Ford was fourth-fastest.
Rubens Barrichello of Brazil, back after escaping with only a broken nose  after crashing at 180mph the day before Ayrton Senna was killed at Imola,  improved to fifth-fastest in his Jordan-Hart and shares the third row with  Frenchman Jean Alesi in a Ferrari.
The second qualifying session had been slightly delayed by an accident to  Andrea Montermini.
The Italian, in his first Grand Prix meeting for Roland Ratzenberger who  was killed at San Marino, escaped unhurt when he crashed his Simtek-Ford.
Drivers and engineers in the paddocks held their breath as Montermini lost  control coming out of a bend, spun across the track and smashed the front of  his car into a low wall.
Former world champion Niki Lauda, who now heads the Grand Prix Drivers'  Association, said there was nothing anyone could do to prevent such an  accident.
"I haven't any solutions to this," the Austrian said.
Top teams had refused to race on Friday until motor racing authorities  agreed to a more flexible timetable for introducing changes to make the cars  slower and safer. They claimed the haste with which they were brought in had  only made the situation more dangerous.
The changes were rushed through after Brazil's triple world champion Senna  and Ratzenberger were killed at San Marino and another Austrian, Karl  Wendlinger, suffered serious head injuries in a Monaco GP crash.
