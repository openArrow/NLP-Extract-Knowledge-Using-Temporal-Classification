A presidential spokesman ruled out power-sharing  with UNITA in a government of national unity Saturday but said the rebel  movement could still join the cabinet.
Waldemiro Vaz said government ministers from the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola would have to carry out the program of the ruling  Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), which swept legislative  elections in September 1992.
UNITA has contested the election outcome and fighting between the two  movements broke out again ending a short lull in the civil war that erupted  after Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos said Friday his government would give  special status to UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi in a government even though this  would be one of the more difficult tasks.
He said he hoped for a solution "as soon as possible" at renewed,  internationally-mediated peace talks under way since November, on and off, in  the Zambian capital Lusaka.
