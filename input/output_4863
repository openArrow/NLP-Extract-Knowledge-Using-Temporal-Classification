China's crucial 1994 state-bond issue has been  largely successful with all two-year bonds sold out ahead of schedule and 67  percent of their three-year equivalents taken up, the ministry of finance said  Saturday.
The 27-billion-yuan (three-billion-dollar) issue of two-year treasury  bonds was sold out May 25, five days before the cut-off date, the ministry  said, adding that 40.25 billion yuan of the 60 billion-yuan three-year bond  issue had also been sold.
A ministry official in charge of the issue said he was confident that the  remaining 33 percent of three-year bonds would be sold by the end of June as  planned.
This year's 87-billion-yuan state bond issue, launched April 1, is vital  to the government because the state treasury will for the first time be unable  to offset its budget deficit -- forecast to double that of 1993 to 66.9  billion yuan -- by borrowing from the central bank.
The sales figures will be welcomed with relief by the government, which  had to extend the deadline for last year's 30 billion-yuan issue due to a lack  of public interest.
While the 1994 rates -- of 13 percent for the two-year bonds and 13.96  percent for three-year bonds -- are more than one percentage point higher than  bank deposits of the same term, they are still well below inflation, which is  running at 20 percent nationwide and even higher in the cities.
However, recent financial reforms banning the unauthorised raising of  capital has freed more funds for bond sale and made the issue more attractive.
The response to the 1994 issue has been especially warm in inland  provinces, while the reception has been less than enthusiastic in the  more-developed coastal regions which provide a wider choice of investment  opportunities.
