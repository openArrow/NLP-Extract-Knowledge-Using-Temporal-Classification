Until <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE">this week</TIMEX3>, Keating was <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">coasting</EVENT> towards the middle of his first term  as prime minister, well ahead in the polls, his prospects for <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">winning</EVENT> the <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE">1996</TIMEX3>  election <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">bolstered</EVENT> by the best economic indicators for <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION">30 years</TIMEX3>.&#13;
Consumer confidence is <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">soaring</EVENT>, the currency is buoyant, a growth rate of  four percent is among the highest in the Western world, inflation is among the  lowest, interest rates are at their most affordable for decades and  unemployment is still high but <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">falling</EVENT>.&#13;
Best of all for Keating, he had a chief political opponent who by his own  admission, was "no politician".&#13;
Former economics professor John Hewson was also <EVENT eid="e9" class="PERCEPTION" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">seen</EVENT> as contemptuous of  the kind of political machinations necessary to <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">lay</EVENT> a glove on a formidable  political street fighter like Keating.&#13;
But if the pundits are any judge all that <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">changed</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE">Monday</TIMEX3> and a new sense  of optimism <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">swept</EVENT> the parliamentary corridors <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">occupied</EVENT> by a conservative  opposition in the wilderness for <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION">11 years</TIMEX3>.&#13;
Alexander Downer, <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">born</EVENT> to politics <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE">42 years ago</TIMEX3> as son and grandson of  distinguished Liberal politicians and proud to <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">declare</EVENT> himself a politician  <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">became</EVENT> not just opposition leader, but alternative prime minister.&#13;
His elevation was <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">welcomed</EVENT> by media commendators who <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">took</EVENT> the view that  green as Downer may be he will be a tougher opponent than his predecessor.&#13;
Suddenly, it <EVENT eid="e19" class="I_STATE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">seemed</EVENT>, a Labor government <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE">now</TIMEX3> in its fifth term, is <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">facing</EVENT> a  real <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">challenge</EVENT> to its prospects for a sixth.&#13;
A poll <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">published</EVENT> by the Sydney Morning Herald on <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e23" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">indicated</EVENT> a  spectacular <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">turnaround</EVENT> of political perceptions, effectively <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">reversing</EVENT> the  standing of the party leaders.&#13;
It <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">gave</EVENT> Downer an immediate lead over Keating, <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">showing</EVENT> almost 60 percent  of those <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">polled</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e29" class="I_STATE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">thought</EVENT> he would <EVENT eid="e30" class="STATE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="would">have</EVENT> a better chance against Keating than  Hewson.&#13;
Although pollster Irving Saulwick <EVENT eid="e31" class="I_ACTION" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">conceded</EVENT> it was a "first blush" reaction  which could quickly <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="could">change</EVENT>, some political analysts <EVENT eid="e33" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">believe</EVENT> support for  Keating is so flimsy it would <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="would">take</EVENT> little to <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">destroy</EVENT> it.&#13;
"I <EVENT eid="e36" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">think</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE">this week</TIMEX3> is the <EVENT eid="e37" class="ASPECTUAL" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">start</EVENT> of next election and I <EVENT eid="e38" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">think</EVENT> Downer's  election <EVENT eid="e39" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">makes</EVENT> it 50-50," Sydney University politics professor Rod Tiffen <EVENT eid="e40" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">told</EVENT>  AFP.&#13;
"The business cycle is <EVENT eid="e41" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">moving</EVENT> as well as the government could possibly  <EVENT eid="e42" class="I_STATE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="could">expect</EVENT>, but I also <EVENT eid="e43" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">believe</EVENT> support for Keating is very brittle because the  government still <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">bears</EVENT> a lot of scars from the recession."&#13;
"Unemployment is likely to still be around nine percent at the next  election and I <EVENT eid="e45" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">think</EVENT> if Downer is even a reasonably competent leader who  doesn't needlessly make enemies then he is in with a very strong chance."&#13;
"But Keating is a brilliant political fighter and there is no way he will  <EVENT eid="e46" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="FUTURE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">go</EVENT> down without a gigantic fight so it could be very interesting to <EVENT eid="e47" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">watch</EVENT>."&#13;
Elaine Thompson, associate professor of political science at the  University of New South Wales <EVENT eid="e48" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">described</EVENT> Downer as the closest the  conservatives have to the typical successful Labor politician -- "a person  born and <EVENT eid="e49" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">bred</EVENT> to politics who lives and breathes politics."&#13;
"This means he will have a much better sense of going for the jugular and  he will be able to <EVENT eid="e50" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">give</EVENT> as good as he gets," she <EVENT eid="e51" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT>.&#13;
"I'm sure Keating will <EVENT eid="e52" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="FUTURE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">play</EVENT> it tough to <EVENT eid="e53" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">assert</EVENT> his dominance, but I <EVENT eid="e54" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">think</EVENT>  Downer is also very tough and his election as leader has the potential to  <EVENT eid="e55" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">change</EVENT> the political equation in Australia."&#13;
