German M3 money supply grew at an annual rate of  15.8 percent during April and far exceeded the Bundesbank's target of 4.0-6.0  percent for 1994, provisional figures from the German central bank showed on  Tuesday.
The M3 figure had shown a 15.4-percent growth rate in March, 17.5 percent  in February and 21.2 percent in January.
The Bundesbank stressed in a statement that money supply "grew strongly in  April" partly because the bank had paid almost all of its profits for 1993 to  the state in that month
It said that the April figure was still much influenced by the expansion  in German M3 around the end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994, which the bank  said was caused by exceptional factors.
The April figure was also attributable to uncertainty on world markets,  the bank said, expressing the hope that recent German interest rate cuts would  ease a liquidity bottle-neck.
Economists partly explain the continuing high rate of M3 growth by the  movement back into Germany of investment funds from Luxembourg, which have  gone into short-term deposits while awaiting a calming of the bond market.
With a hoped-for move now into relatively more attractive longer-term  deposits after the latest Bundesbank rate cuts, these funds would no longer  fall within the measurement of M3.
M3 comprises money in circulation, available deposits and deposits made  for less than four years.
