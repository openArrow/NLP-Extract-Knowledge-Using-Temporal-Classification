Haiti's new foreign minister, appointed this week  by the military regime in the Caribbean nation, has refused to give up his job  as a newspaper reporter here.
But Charles David, who has used a union contract agreement with La Presse  newspaper to take a six-month leave of absence, now has all his Canadian  assets frozen.
David, 53, was named to the foreign affairs cabinet post Monday by Haiti's  military-appointed president, Emile Jonassaint. The government is not  recognized by Canada or other major powers who are all insisting on the return  to power of ousted president Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Foreign Affairs department spokeswoman Lilian Campbell said David's name  had been added to a list of people considered friendly to the Port-au-Prince  regime and "his assets are frozen ... if he returns to Canada, he will have to  prove his (residence) status."
Under Canadian law, landed immigrants are allowed to leave the country for  only six months at a time without endangering their status.
Claude Masson, assistant publisher of La Presse, told the English language  Montreal Gazette that La Presse had tried unsuccessfully to persuade David to  resign from the newspaper where he is employed as an international affairs  reporter.
But meanwhile, because of the union agreement, La Presse was obliged to  grant his request for a six-month leave of absence to pursue his political  career.
In an editorial in Wednesday's La Presse, the newspaper said: "La Presse  does not approve of this illegitimate government -- which is not elected, is  anti-democratic -- and does not approve of Charles David's decision to become  a member of the cabinet."
The paper said that if David -- who has worked for La Presse for 22 years  -- failed to return after six months, he would lose his job automatically.
If he returned within the six months allowed under his contract, he would  not be allowed to report on international politics.
