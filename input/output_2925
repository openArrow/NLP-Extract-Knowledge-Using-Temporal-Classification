Venezuelan Oil Minister Erwin Jose Arrietta held  talks here Sunday on boosting cooperation between OPEC countries, Tehran Radio  said.
Arrietta told President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani that his visit was  aimed at studying the oil situation in the region and seeking Iran's  experience in mines and metallurgy.
"There are vast grounds for coopertion in areas of mutual interest," he  said.
Rafsanjani replied that Iran was prepared to share its expertise in oil,  gas, mining, metallurgy and petrochemicals.
Arrietta also met Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh, who called for unity  between its members to strengthen the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting  Countries, to which both Iran and Venezuela belong.
During a visit to Kuwait last week, Arrietta said his country sought an  OPEC production cut to help stabilise oil prices, according to Tehran Radio.
