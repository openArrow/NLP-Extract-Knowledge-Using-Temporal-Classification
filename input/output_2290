Former British foreign secretary Lord Howe  called Friday on China and all concerned with Hong Kong's future to exercise  restraint in the run-up to the territory's 1997 handover to China, radio  reports said.
Howe, who arrived here Wednesday for a three-day private visit, told  government-run Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) that "it is very important  for China to exercise restraint, to cherish Hong Kong as it has developed, and  as it is developing."
"It is important for Hong Kong to recognise that it can't present itself  as a bridge head for revolutionary changes in China itself," said Howe, who  was a principal negotiator of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration.
Howe said the "one country, two systems," which China has envisaged for  Hong Kong to maintain its capitalist system for 50 years after 1997, required  "each system to refrain from destabilizing or shaking each other."
Howe's remarks come at a time of political standoff between Britain and  China over Governor Chris Patten's decision to go ahead with political reforms  in Hong Kong, despite China's vehement objection.
