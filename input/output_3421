The tiny bollworm, which devastated China's cotton  production in 1993, is posing an equally destructive threat to this year's  crop, a top agricultural official was quoted as saying Tuesday.
"Local governments should put the war against the pest on top of their  agenda," vice-minister of agriculture Liu Chengguo was quoted as saying by the  China Daily.
By providing farmers with adequate protection against the bollworm pest,  the government hopes to lure more farmers back into cotton production.
Many farmers have turned their backs on cotton in recent years in favour  of more profitable activities and the government was forced to raise cotton  wholesale prices twice last year in a bid to stimulate falling output.
Liu said a plant protection network should be set up to teach cotton  growers pest-prevention skills, including effective use of pesticides.
China is one of the largest cotton producers in the world and the  government views the crop as playing a major role in the country's economic  development.
Output has recovered this year as total acreage given over to cotton has  expanded to more than five million hectares (12.3 million acres), but that  figure remains well short of the state-set target of six million hectares.
Now that the spring cotton has been planted, Liu said the target could  only be met by expanding the summer-sowing areas.
