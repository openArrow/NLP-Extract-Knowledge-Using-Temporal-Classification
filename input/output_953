Petr Korda overcame a totally  inadequate Stefan Edberg 6-1 6-4 to give the Czech Republic an early lead over  Sweden at the World Team Cup.
The Swede managed to earn just four points in the first five games. Edberg  finally held serve for 1-5, but Korda took the first set when Edberg hit a  forehand long.
Edberg, who took only two games off Korda in the same event a year ago,  had no touch at all, mis-timing his runs to the net and committing a string of  errors on his volleys.
Although he offered a little more resistance in the second set, Korda  still surged to 4-0 lead.
Korda, in contrast to his opponent, made almost no errors, and Edberg was  unable to establish himself until it was too late to matter.
Leading 5-2, Korda was broken as he served for victory, but he came  through safely at his next opportunity, winning in 59 minutes.
"He didn't make many mistakes, but I didn't play particularly well in the  beginning. I wasn't really in the match," admitted Edberg.
"I have lost my game a little since Madrid last month and have to try and  put it back together again. The way I'm playing now, the French Open will be  tough, but you can play a couple of good sets and it can turn change very  quickly."
He believes that Pete Sampras is the overwhelming favourite to win the  French Open, which begins next week.
"Sampras is going to be tough to beat on any surface. He's playing so well  at the moment," Edberg acknowledged.
