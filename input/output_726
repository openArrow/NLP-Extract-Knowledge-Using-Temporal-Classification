Four Buddhist monks imprisoned for joining a protest  march in Vietnman have been on a hunger strike for three weeks to denounce  their punishment, the Buddhist church to which they belong said in Paris  Sunday.
The four monks were convicted in January of "disturbing the public order"  and sentenced to up to four years in prison after they joined a demonstration  in the former imperial capital of Hue, south of Hanoi, organised by the  Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnman, an offshoot of the Buddhist Church of  Vietnman  which was set up in 1981 by the communist regime.
The monks, who are being fed intravenously, are asking that their prison  conditions be improved and that they be allowed to appeal their conviction as  allowed by law, the church said in a statement.
The church has also asked the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to  intervene and has appealed to the International Committee of the Red Cross to  send a delegation to visit the monks.
The two Buddhist churches in Vietnman have been fighting for supremacy  among the country's 50 million Buddhists, who make up 60 percent of the  population.
