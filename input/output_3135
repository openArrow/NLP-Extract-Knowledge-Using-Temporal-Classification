The Japanese Minolta Camera Co. Ltd. announced plans  to invest 2.5 billion yen (24 million dollars) to set up a wholly-owned unit  in southern China to produce photocopiers and laser-beam printers for export,  on Monday.
The Osaka-based company plans to launch production at a new plant in  Dongguan in Guangdong province in October, aiming to double the initial  monthly output of 5,000 copiers and 10,000 printers within six months. The  local content ratio is targeted to reach between 70 percent and 80 percent.
"We decided to set up the assembly plant in southern China due to the  abundant labor force in high technology and the competitive prices of  necessary components," a statement said.
Minolta said it would set up a second subsidiary in Hong Kong to oversee  the new operation, including management, technology and procuring parts.
The Japanese company has been manufacturing single-lens reflex cameras in  Shanghai since 1985, producing 6,000 units a month. Minolta has also operated  a camera wholesale subsidiary in Hong Kong since 1971.
