The United States and Japan have reached  agreement on resuming bilateral trade negotiations, ending a three-month  deadlock, US officials said here Tuesday.
US Trade Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor was due to make a press  statement later in the day on the results of five days of marathon  negotiations here to try to get the talks on opening Japan's markets and  reducing its 60 billion dollar trade surplus with Washington back on the rails.
The two sides have reached a compromise under which the United States  would assure Japan in writing that it will not rely solely on numerical  targets to judge whether Tokyo is keeping its pledge to open up its markets.
In return, Japan will accept that measurable results are needed to gauge  progress in market-opening, senior US trade officials said.
The agreement will enable the two sides to return to the negotiating table.
Talks collapsed in February in disagreement over ways to measure progress  in opening Japan's markets.
Tokyo was rejecting US calls for numerical targets, saying this smacked of  managed trade and quotas.
Over five days of talks here the two sides have been trying to agree  virtually word by word a written accord that would take into account Tokyo's  concerns but also meet the US insistence on a viable measure of progress.
Tuesday's deal is simply an agreement on the ground rules to resume  negotiations, and the two sides now have to get down to the serious work of  hammering out accords in various sectors under the so-called framework  agreement reached last July.
Both sides had been anxious to get the talks back on track before the  Group of Seven summit in Naples in early July.
Reports from Tokyo before the talks began suggested the Japanese team  could bring proposals for at least partial acceptance of numerical targets in  the government procurement sector.
The government procurement talks cover computers, supercomputers,  satellites, medical technology and telecommunications.
