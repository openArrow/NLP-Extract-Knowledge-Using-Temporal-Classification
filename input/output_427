Several armored cars took up positions Saturday in  the Georgian capital Tbilisi ahead of a debate in parliament on President  Eduard Shevardnadze's challenge to deputies to abolish the post of presidency.
The armored cars were reinforcing police checkpoints already in place for  several days in the center of the town, witnesses said.
Shevardnadze submitted Friday his resignation and proposed abolishing the  presidency to protest the deputies' refusal to ratify an accord towards  settling the conflict with the separatist republic of Abkhazia in western  Georgia.
Ramaz Sakavarelidze, Shevardnadze's press officer, quoted by the Georgia  news agency Iprinda said that Shevardnadze would remain parliamentary speaker,  a post to which he was elected in October 1992.
Shevardnadze has been head of state since his election in November 1992.
The deputies fear the accord will authorize the secession of Abkhazia. The  accord, to be signed Sunday by Georgian and Abkhazian delegations in Moscow,  calls for deploying Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) troops in a  12-kilometre (7.2 mile) security zone separating Abkhazia from the rest of  Georgia.
Georgia has been hit since becoming independent in 1991 by a series of  political crises, including two civil wars and the Abkhazian secession  struggle, at a time when the national economy is in ruins.
