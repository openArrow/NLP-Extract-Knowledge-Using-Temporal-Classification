The two other leading candidates are both judges. Richard Arnold, who is  from Clinton's home state Arkansas, and Stephen Breyer of Massachusetts, are  both considered moderates.
"They would be slam dunks for the president," and easily confirmed said  Utah Senator Orrin Hatch, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee.
Arnold's health problems are an issue and also working against him is his  connection with Arkansas, where Clinton was governor. The White House wants to  avoid any hint of influence peddling.
Clinton's nominee will replace 85-year-old Justice Harry Blackmun who  decided to resign after 24 years on the Supreme Court.
Clinton named his first Supreme Court justice last June: Ruth Bader  Ginsburg, known as a moderate and an abortion rights advocate.
