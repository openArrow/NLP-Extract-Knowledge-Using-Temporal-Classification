A UN plane made two safe flights  in and out of Tuzla airport Thursday, two days after Bosnian Serb artillery  shelled the airport when another UN plane landed there, UN spokesmen said.
They said a third flight was expected to take place later in the day.
The flight Tuesday had been the first into the airport since April 14. But  it took off abruptly after eight Serb artillery shells thudded in after it set  down on the runway, though there was no damage.
The United Nations said there were no problems Thursday and no Serb  artillery fire when the white Ilyushin 76 tranport plane made two successful  trips in and out of the airport on a circuit from Split to Tuzla to the  Croatian capital Zagreb then again through Tuzla before heading back to Split.
The plane brought in material and equipment -- including radar -- for the  UN Protection Force in Tuzla, a UN-declared safe area.
On its second trip out of Tuzla, the plane evacuated five people needing  medical treatment accompanied by nine members of their families on behalf of  the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
The mainly Moslem Bosnian army handed over control of the airport to the  UNPROFOR on March 22.
Twenty-two flights carrying equipment for UN forces stationed here landed  at the airport through April 14, but no humanitarian flights have yet arrived.
