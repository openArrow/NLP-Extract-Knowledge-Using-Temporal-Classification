A safety official Tuesday  slammed the behaviour of a Norwegian tourist who for the second time has  sparked a major search and rescue operation by going missing in a rugged area  in southwestern New Zealand.
A 30-person search and rescue squad was combing a 320-square-kilometre  (128-square-mile) area of Fiordland for Rebecca Fuchs.
It was the second time Fuchs, who is in her 20s, had gone missing while  hiking by herself in Fiordland. She was rescued by police last Easter after  she was found disoriented and poorly equipped.
Mountain Safety Council assistant director Bob Badland said he could not  understand why Fuchs would go back to the same area where she had been lost  before.
He said he had no sympathy for Fuchs, who was travelling alone and  reportedly poorly equipped for the rough Fiordland terrain.
"Travelling on your own in the back country -- not a lot of people do that  other than hunters who are pretty experienced.
"I wouldn't go to Africa and go wandering around the back country in a  pair of sandals."
"She sounds like one of those people who are pretty irresponsible if she  hasn't learned from her first experience," Badland said. "She is putting the  people looking for her at risk as well."
Badland said that if Fuchs had become lost because of her own actions,  there was the question of cost to be addressed.
"There's a phenomenal network to set up in a search and rescue exercise,  and if she's been irresponsible, who's going to pay for it?
"You and I are going to have to pay for it as taxpayers."
Invercargill police said earlier costs included paying 2500 NZ dollars  (1,472 US dollars) per hour for an air force helicopter, as well as labour  costs for a 30-member paid rescue squad and food, equipment and communication.
Searchers had found no sign of Fuchs as of Tuesday.
