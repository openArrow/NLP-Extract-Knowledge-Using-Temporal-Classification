Israel is developing a "biological weapon" to  destroy Lebanese poppy fields and so end drug-trafficking across the border  into Israel, the daily Maariv said Friday.
Police last year called on the most advanced genetic engineering  techniques to develop a gene, based on poppy derivatives, capable of  destroying up to 70 percent of the Lebanese crop.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin approved the project and put up one million  dollars for the research, the paper said.
A police spokesman would neither confirm or deny the report.
Drug-taking has reached huge proportions in Israel, with a market worth  about two billion dollars, according to 1993 police figures.
Israeli coordinator in Lebanon Uri Lubrani told the paper that once there  is peace with Syria and Lebanon "and the opening of borders I don't even want  to think about the catastrophe that could take place."
Police say three to six tonnes of pure heroin, hundreds of kilos (pounds)  of cocaine and dozens of tonnes of hashish are smuggled into Israel every  year, mainly from Lebanon.
