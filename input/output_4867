The Palestinian National Authority has adopted a  political program for an interim period of autonomy on the Gaza Strip and in  the West Bank town of Jericho and has made 14 apointments in the provisonal  government, a PLO spokesman announced here Saturday.
Yasser Abed Rabbo said the Authority, which is to be headed by Palestine  Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat, would meet again here Saturday  principally to name ministers of interior and information.
Abed Rabbo said he had been named to hold the culture portfolio.
No definitive date has been set for Arafat and the rest of the authority  to become operational in the newly autonomous areas. But Abed Rabbo said the  new administration would be up and running "in the next two weeks."
