One of the main goals of the new Palestinian  Authority is to win back all the territory occupied by Israel since 1967,  including East Jerusalem, PLO spokesman Yasser Abed Rabbo said Saturday.
The authority's objectives are set out in its first political programme,  adopted by a meeting here but still to be ratified by the Palestine Liberation  Organisation's executive committee.
Rabbo said it reiterated the Palestinians' position on Jerusalem, which is  considered "an integral part of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967"  when Israel also seized the Gaza Strip and West Bank in a Middle East war.
The spokesman said the document set out the authority's aims until  elections in October for an autonomy council to run the autonomous areas of  Gaza and Jericho for a five-year interim period as set out under the May 4  Israel-PLO autonomy accord.
The authority also made 14 appointments to its "cabinet" in talks which  began Friday at the PLO headquarters in Tunis and are due to continue until  Sunday, Abed Rabbo said.
On Saturday members were to nominate interior and information "ministers,"  Abed Rabbo said.
PLO chairman Yasser Arafat is to head the 24-member authority.
Bethlehem mayor Elias Friej, who will be responsible for tourism and  archaeology, said Arafat would also be take over the interior ministry.
Abed Rabbo said there was still no definite date for Arafat's return to  Gaza and Jericho but that it would happen "at the latest within two weeks."
PLO sources said late Friday that the authority would be sworn in in  Jericho and not in Tunis as originally planned.
Meanwhile Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation in the  peace talks, has turned down the post of information "minister," Abed Rabbo  added.
Ashrawi was nominated by Arafat, but has said she wants to continue her  work with a Palestinian civil rights organisation in the territories.
