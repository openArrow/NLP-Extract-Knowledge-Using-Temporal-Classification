The Sudanese army Wednesday recaptured the town  of Pageri on the road between Juba and Nimule, a stronghold of the rebel Sudan  People's Liberation Army (SPLA) on the Ugandan border, radio reports said.
The army liberated Pageri as people were celebrating the Bairam feast, the  national radio of Omdurman quoted a statement by the armed forces general  command as saying.
Pageri is about 90 miles (145 kilometers) south of Juba, the capital of  Eastern Equatoria state and about 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of rebel-held  Nimule, the ultimate goal of the current summer offensive of government troops  and one of the few areas currently under SPLA control.
The statement reiterated the army commitment to a peaceful settlement of  conflict in south Sudan.
The radio earlier quoted Sudanese President Brigadier General Omar  el-Beshir as saying that his governemnt was still committed to a peaceful  settlement of the south Sudan problem despite the failure of Nairobi-held  peace talks.
Despite the fact that the SPLA rebels are now "feeling the weakness of  their military and negotiating position," the government is still committed to  the initiative sponsored by the heads of state of the Intergovernmental  Authority for Drought and Development (IGADD), he said.
In a related development, the US embassy to Khartoum issued a statement  saying that US President Bill Clinton named Melissa F. Wells as his special  representative to Sudan.
The press release said Wells would assist regional efforts to negotiate a  ceasefire and permanent peace agreement to end the 11-year civil war in south  Sudan and ensure delivery of humanitarian aid to the people there.
Wells would work closely with US ambassador Donald Petterson and with the  leaders of Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda who have sent envoys to the  peace-brokering IGADD committee.
