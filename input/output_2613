Canada will give some 10,000 asylum seekers who  have already been rejected and threatened with deportation another chance,  officials said Friday.
The decision applies to asylum seekers - in particular Chinese and Somalis  - who have already received a negative response to their requests and who have  exhausted their appeals, said Immigration Minister Sergio Marchi.
The offer, however, is not a general amnesty. Each case will be evaluated  separately, said ministry spokesman Gerry Maffre.
The Canadian government decided recently to suspend the deportation of  thousands of asylum seekers under pressure from refugee defense groups. The  groups cited the risks refugees could face if they were repatriated.
Official estimates of the number of Chinese seeking asylum who have been  rejected but not deported reach around 4,500.
From now on, before each person reaches their final appeal, authorities  will have to calculate the risk each refugee would face if deported to nations  with a known history of torture, arbitrary arrests, and disappearances, said  the spokesman.
Until now, the burden rested on the asylum seekers to prove that they  would be endangered if they returned to their homelands.
