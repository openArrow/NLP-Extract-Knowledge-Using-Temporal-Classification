Former president Carlos Andres Perez and a former  cabinet minister were arrested Wednesday on charges of misappropriating public  funds, the chief justice of the Supreme Court said.
The arrests of Perez and former cabinet ministers Reinaldo Figueredo and  Alejandro Izaguirre were ordered by the Supreme Court, said chief justice  Roberto Yepes Boscan.
Perez and Izaguirre were taken to the headquarters of the Judicial  Technical Police and were to be transferred from there to the El Junquito  jail, Yepes said. Figueredo was still at large and believed to have fled the  country.
Shortly before his arrest, Perez proclaimed his innocence.
"I am proud to serve and to have served Venezuela," he said outside the  court. "I have committed no crime to be ashamed of."
The Supreme Court began proceedings May 20 against the former president  and his two cabinet ministers, who were accused of misappropriating 17.2  million dollars taken from a secret Interior Ministry slush fund.
Perez was suspended from office in May 1993 and removed from office in  August of the same year because of the charges.
Perez, 71, is entitled to house arrest because of his advanced age, but  his lawyers said he would not request it.
