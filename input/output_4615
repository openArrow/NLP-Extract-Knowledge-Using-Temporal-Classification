Hong Kong teenager Shiu Chi Ho, convicted of  vandalism, has submitted a clemency petition to President Ong Teng Cheong to  spare him from caning for spray-painting cars, his lawyer said Friday.
"The petition has just been put in and we are waiting to see the outcome,"  lawyer Kok Mun Loon said.
Shiu, a British passport holder, was found guilty of spray-painting four  cars last September and sentenced to 12 strokes of a rattan cane and eight  months imprisonment on April 21.
The prosecution dropped 22 further vandalism charges against Shiu on  Monday.
Kok said he visited Shiu in Queenstown Remand Prison on Wednesday to  explain the contents of the eight-page petition and its enclosures.
"He seemed to have lost weight but he seemed to be all right. He has been  reading a lot to pass his time," Kok said.
The British and Hong Kong governments have also sent an appeal to the  Singapore government to spare the rod.
Shiu, who has lived here for eight of the past 10 years, is the son of  former Hong Kong actor Shiu Chung On, who is now the Chinese drama director of  the Singapore Broadcasting Corp.
Shiu and caned American vandal Michael Fay were among a group of foreign  students who were arrested last October after public complaints of cars being  spray-painted.
Fay, who is also in Queenstown prison, was given four lashes of the cane  earlier this month after the Singapore government reduced his court-ordered  sentence by two strokes following an appeal by President Bill Clinton.
The government said other vandals involved in the incident would receive  similar reductions in their sentences.
Government prosecutors earlier this month dropped vandalism charges  against 16-year-old American Stephen Freehill and a 15-year-old Malaysian who  cannot be named because of his age, saying they could not rely on the evidence  of their accomplices as witnesses.
Another 15-year-old Malaysian has been remanded in a boys' home for a  similar offence.
