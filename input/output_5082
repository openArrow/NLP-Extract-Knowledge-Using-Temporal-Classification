Won Jae-Sook of South Korea clinched her  second title in a month when she overcame a four-stroke deficit to win the  480,000-dollar Toto Motors women's golf here Sunday.
The 24-year-old Korean, who grabbed her first victory on the Japan LPGA  Tour three weeks ago, carded five birdies against a bogey for a three-round  total of five-under-par 211 on the 6,185-yard Toto Hanno Country Club course.
Won, the team gold medallist at the 1990 Beijing Asian Games and also the  winner of an amateur title when she was a university student here in 1990,  received the winner's check of nine million yen (86,500 dollars).
Her second career victory takes Won up to second place on the LPGA money  earners list with 31,259,166 yen (300,000 dollars) behind Ikuyo Shiotani of  Japan.
Kumiko Hiyoshi shot a two-under-par 70 for 212 to finish at the runner-up  place, followed by fellow Japanese Akemi Yamaoka and Aiko Hashimoto on 213s.
Overnight leader Michiko Hattori of Japan ended the day with a three over  par 75 for 214 at fifth place tie with compatriots Fuki Kido and Mayumi Hirase.
