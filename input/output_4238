Andrea De Cesaris will replace the injured Karl  Wendlinger from the Canadian Grand Prix, the Sauber Mercedes team said  Thursday.
Wendlinger was still in a coma in a Nice, France, hospital but out of  danger after crashing in practice for the Monaco Grand Prix two weeks ago.
Sauber Mercedes have entered only one car, driven by German Heinz-Harald  Frentzen, for Sunday's Spanish GP at Barcelona.
"For us the entry of a second car has alaways been only possible as soon  as there is no more threat to Karl's life. His condition has developed very  positively over the last days, but we still have to be patient," said team  chief Peter Sauber.
De Cesaris was retained for the rest of the season.
The 35-year-old Italian has raced in 199 Grands Prix since making his  Formula One debut for Alfa Romeo in 1980.
He finished fourth at Monaco when he drove for Jordan in place of their  injured Brazilian Rubens Barichello.
