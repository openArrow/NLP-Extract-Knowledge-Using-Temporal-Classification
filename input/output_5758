President Nelson Mandela said Tuesday he was  "delighted" to learn that South Africa would Wednesday rejoin the Commonwealth  after a 33-year absence.
"The South African government is looking forward to making a positive  contribution in the various fields of endeavour pursued by the Commonwealth,"  Mandela said in a statement here.
Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka Anyouka announced in London Tuesday  that South Africa would be readmitted to the Commonwealth from June 1  following the country's first free elections last month which ended more than  three centuries of white minority rule.
Mandela said the step was "a tribute to the momentous changes that have  taken place in our country as well as a challenge for South Africa to play its  part in the worldwide quest for a peaceful, harmonious and caring world."
The people of South Africa were indebted to the contribution made by  Commonwealth members to bringing about a democratic South Africa, he added.
