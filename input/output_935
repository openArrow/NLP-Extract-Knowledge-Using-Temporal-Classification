British tobacco-to-insurance giant BAT Industries  on Monday signed an agreement with the government of the Republic of  Uzbekistan to acquire 51 percent of Uz Tobacco AD, BAT said.
BAT said that under the agreement it would invest 200 million dollars in  Uz Tobacco during the next five years, adding that its equity interest in the  company would rise as capital was invested.
Uz Tobacco is a new company which would own the principal operating assets  of the Uzbek tobacco industry, BAT said.
BAT also said it would modernise the existing cigarette factory in  Tashkent; build a new cigarette factory near Samarkand; invest in the tobacco  leaf processing plants in Samarkand and Urgut; provide training and technical  services; and invest in the industry's social infrastructure.
Investment in Uzbekistan was an important step in BAT's strategy of  investing in new and developing markets world-wide, the company said.
Ulrich Herter, managing director of BAT Industries said Uzbekistan relied  largely on imported cigarettes to satisfy local consumption.
"This agreement involves a major investment in modern cigarette  manufacturing which will allow Uzbekistan to decrease its dependence on  cigarette imports and improve prospects for cigarette exports to the  neighbouring republics of Central Asia and elsewhere in the former Soviet  Union," he said.
The price of BAT shares rose by five pence to 448 by midday.
