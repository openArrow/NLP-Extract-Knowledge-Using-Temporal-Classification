The Sri Lankan cricket board dropped its  disciplinary action against Test captain Arjuna Ranatunga here on Friday for  boycotting the Australasia Cup in Sharjah.
Board president Tyronne Fernando said no further action would be taken  because of Ranatunga's "expression of regret at the inconvenience caused" at  missing the April tournament and because of his outstanding contribution to  Sri Lankan cricket.
The board executive committee ruled Ranatunga's conduct "was apparently  motivated by selfless reasons," Fernando said.
The board also directed the selectors to include Ranatunga in the 31-man  national pool picked for Pakistan's tour "in whatever capacity they deemed  fit."
The selectors picked the squad 10 days ago but decided to leave out  Ranatunga until the board conducted their inquiry.
Ranatunga pulled out of the cup as a protest over the exclusion of his  deputy Aravinda de Silva from the side after he failed a fitness test. Opening  batsman Roshan Mahanama captained Sri Lanka in place of Ranatunga.
