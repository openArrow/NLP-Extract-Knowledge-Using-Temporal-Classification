Formula One drivers joined together to form a  pressure group here on Friday in a bid to improve safety in a sport now  overshadowed by death and injury.
The move follows Thursday's crash here which left Austrian driver Karl  Wendlinger fighting for his life, and the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland  Ratzenberger at the San Marino Grand Prix two weeks ago.
Drivers met for four hours on Friday, deciding a plan of action --  primarily to call for circuit safety inspections at the next three races --  and electing four men to represent them.
The main concern was to get their safety concerns across to the ruling  International Automobile Federation (FIA) and its British president, Max  Mosley.
Austria's former world champion Niki Lauda announced after the session at  the Automobile Club de Monaco, that: "We agreed to form a Grand Prix Drivers  Association.
"It was agreed that the representatives of the association would be Niki  Lauda, Michael Schumacher, Gerhard Berger and Christian Fittipaldi.
"The GPDA requests representation on or with the FIA to improve the safety  of Formula One."
He said the association was concerned about "the immediate situation" and  wanted "to look at the next three Grand Prix circuits together with the FIA  for possible improvements."
All the current world championship drivers were at the meeting, along with  three currently without a team -- Britain's Derek Warwick, Frenchman Patrick  Tambay and Italian Riccardo Patrese.
A GPDA had been set up during the 1970s, but petered out in the early  1980s. Drivers have been without any formal representation within the FIA for  several years.
