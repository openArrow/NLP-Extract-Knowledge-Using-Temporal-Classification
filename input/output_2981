Defendents in the trial of Albania's last communist  president, Ramiz Alia, appeared unrepentent Sunday during the second day of  court argument in their trial for ordering summary executions and embezzlement.
Sunday's hearing focused on three of the defendants, former prime minister  Adil Cacani, his deputy, Manush Mustiu, and the former head of the communist  parliament, Rita Marko.
The trio and their co-defendants are charged with abuse of power that led  to murder, summary executions, deportations and embezzlement.
"I am here because of my political convictions. I remain loyal to the  program outlined by my party. I was a communist and and I was elected to my  post by the people," Marko, charged with outlawing religion in 1967, told the  court.
Cacani and Mustiu added that the ban on religion was only in response to  the people's wishes.
Mustiu, who was in charge of a special commission in charge of  deportations, said his commission was necessary considering "the threat the  deportees posed to society."
Some 60,000 people were deported or jailed between 1945-1991 under the  communist regime, according to an organization of former prisoners and  deportees.
The trial of Alia and nine top aides was postponed until Friday. Hearings  in the trial are usually held at weekends.
