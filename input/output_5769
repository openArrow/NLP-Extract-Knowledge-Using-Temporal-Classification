Conchita Martinez finally laid to rest a five-year  jinx at the French Open on Tuesday.
After failing to get any further than the quarter-finals on five previous  visits, the 22-year-old Spaniard finally reached the semi-finals when she  defeated Germany's sixteenth-seed Sabine Hack 2-6, 6-0, 6-2.
Martinez, who has won ten of her 18 career titles on clay and who had not  dropped a set and conceded only 21 games in the tournament before today's  match, could not have made a worse start.
But she patiently worked her way back into the match with some magnificent  baseline tennis in the second-set.
Hack, who had beaten Martinez only once in six previous encounters and who  was playing in Paris for the seventh time, was making a first quarter-final  appearance. The 24-year-old German's previous best performance was to reach  the fourth-round two years ago.
Martinez, who with compatriot Arantxa Sanchez is the only player in the  world to have beaten Graf in the last twelve months (at Philadelphia last  November), now plays either second-seeded Sanchez or Julie Halard of France  for a place in next Saturday's final.
She came to Paris brimming with confidence after beating Martina  Navratilova in straight-sets in the final of the Italian Open earlier this  month
Her best previous Grand Slam performance was to reach the semi-finals at  Wimbledon last year.
The other women's semi-final on Thursday will be between Steffi Graf and  Mary Pierce who both won easy straight-set victories earlier today.
