Bangladeshi feminist writer Taslima Nasreen has  drawn fire from rightwing and fundamentalist groups over anti-Islamic comments  she reportedly made, newspapers said Monday.
Legislator Hafeza Asma Khatun of the fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami party  accused the controversial author of irreverence by calling for the revision of  Islam's holy book, the Koran, the daily Banglabazar newspaper said.
"The matter was of public importance and it had hurt the religious  sentiments of Moslems," the member of parliament was quoted as saying.
A number of fundamentalist and rightwing groups have staged demonstrations  demanding that Nasreen, 31, be hanged or put on trial.
Nasreen, who writes in the Bengali-language and rose to fame after the  Dhaka government banned her book "Lajja" or "Shame," was not available for  comment Monday.
The controversy arose when the pro-Islamic daily Inqilab newspaper quoted  an interview Nasreen gave to India's  The Statesman.
Nasreen told the prestigeous daily: "Whoever has written the Koran has  made it absolutely clear that not a single word can be changed."
"I am not in favour of minor changes. It serves no purpose. The Koran  should be revised thoroughly," she allegedly said.
The government has made no comment on the controversy.
