The UN Security Council approved the phased  deployment of 5,500 peacekeepers to Rwanda and an arms embargo on the  violence-torn African nation.
The vote came early Tuesday after near-record nine hours of debates and  consultations.
In response to a US proposal, the UN peacekeepers will be deployed in  different phases which will be submitted to ongoing reviews.
