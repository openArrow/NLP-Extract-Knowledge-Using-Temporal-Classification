A helicopter that crashed and killed four  soldiers in December while en route to pick up Malaysia's deputy premier,  Anwar Ibrahimhad, had not been properly inspected, Defence Minister Najib Tun  Razak said Monday.
An inquiry into the crash revealed that the pre-flight inspection was  carried out under limited light at dawn, resulting in the "inspection not  being done thoroughly," Najib was quoted by Bernama news agency as saying.
The Indonesian-manufactured Super Puma, built under licence from  Aerospatiale of France, was on its way to pick up Anwar on New Year's Eve when  it plunged into a mangrove swamp in northern Kedah state, killing all four  soldiers on board.
Najib said the poor inspection had resulted in one of the two fastening  devices in the aircraft's cowling, or engine cover, not being properly fixed.
Under normal circumstances, the defect would have been detected  immediately by the crew through the warning system, but the aircraft flew  without the equipment, which was being overhauled, Najib said.
As a result, the helicopter went nose up until its rotor blades cut the  cowling, causing the aircraft to crash, Najib said.
The 24-million-ringgit (9.6 million US) helicopter was delivered to  Malaysia in 1989 by Indonesia's Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (IPTN). It  was  refurbished into a VIP carrier by the Royal Malaysian Air Force.
