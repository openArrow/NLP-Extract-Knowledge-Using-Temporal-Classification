Thailand has recorded 1,953 deaths from Acquired  Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), a health official told Prime Minister Chuan  Leekpai Wednesday.
An official of the Division of Epidemic Control (DEC) told the premier  that the deaths represented nearly one-third of the 5,990 known AIDS cases  here since the disease was first detected in Thailand in 1984.
Of the deaths registered up to the end of April, 72.35 percent of the  victims contracted AIDS through sexual intercourse, a government statement  quoted the DEC official as saying.
Another 10.09 percent contracted AIDS from intravenous drug use, 9.73  percent contracted the disease from their mothers when they were born, and six  people caught it through blood transfusions, he said.
In 7.53 percent of the cases it was not known how the victim contracted  AIDS, he said.
An estimated 600,000 Thais also have the Human Immune-deficiency Virus, or  HIV, that leads to AIDS.
