The troubled Euro-Disney leisure company, which has  just undergone a major financial overhaul, expects to make a loss during the  April to September accounting period, according to its boss Philippe  Bourguignon.
"Once the financial restructuring, including the interim agreement, are  implemented, this will provide the company with sufficient funds to continue  operations," the director said in a group report to be submitted to  share-holders on June 8.
If restructuring proposals were rejected by share-holders, "the company  would find itself facing serious liquidity problems," Bourguignon added in his  report released Monday.
