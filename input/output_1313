It may be time to ease pressure on Japan for  specific market opening commitments because of the domestic political upheaval  in Tokyo, President Bill Clinton's top economic advisor said.
"The issue here is ... trying to moderate or adjust the timing to the  political realities in Japan without changing the overall thrust of the  policy," Clinton's chief economic advisor Laura D'Andrea Tyson said in an  interview published in the Washington Post Tuesday.
"A policy which is sensible under one set of circumstances may have to be  adjusted to a set of circumstances which no one ... predicted would be the  case," she said.
The US administration is now dealing with its third Japanese prime  minister in less than a year since reaching a framework agreement in July to  open up Japan's markets and reduce Tokyo's 60 billion dollar trade surplus  with Washington.
The less than one-month-old coalition government of Tsutomu Hata is at  best shaky and narrowly escaped a no-confidence motion Tuesday.
Talks on the details of implementing the framework agreement broke down in  February in disagreement over how to measure progress in opening Japan's  markets.
The US side has insisted that the ball is in Japan's court and it must  come up with new proposals before Washington will return to the negotiating  table.
But after a flurry of diplomatic activity last week, senior Japanese  negotiators are due in Washington for talks Thursday which could pave the way  for a resumption of the negotiations.
