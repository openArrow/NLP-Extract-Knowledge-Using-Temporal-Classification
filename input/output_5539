Peru's National Police chief has been accused of  obstructing justice in connection with a drug case, officials said Monday.
National Police director Victor Alva also stands accused of failure to  fulfill his professional duties for allegedly delaying his report on the  escape of two police officials suspected of netting millions of dollars from  the sale of seized drugs. A date for his trial was not immediately announced.
Huanuco department prosecutor Carlos Gonzalez announced drug trafficking  charges against the two renegade police officials, Major Percy Cabrera Rojas  and Captain Dilberto Oliva Nole, and 78 other authorities several weeks ago.
Judge Jose Lopez Mendoza said he would try the group of 80 for allegedly  seizing 180 kilograms (397 pounds) of coca paste, and then reselling it for 80  million dollars.
Coca paste, made from coca leaves, is the raw material from which cocaine  is processed. The paste is an interim step in the drug production process.
Authorities said the group of 80 was involved in the confiscation and  later sale of the coca paste at a special operations base in Aucayacu, Huanuco.
Sunday, Armed Forces Joint Command chief General Nicolas Hermoza  acknowledged there were cases in which military staff were involved in the  drug trade, particularly with alleged trafficker Demetrio "El Vaticano"  Chavez," who was captured in Colombia and now is jailed in a military prison.
