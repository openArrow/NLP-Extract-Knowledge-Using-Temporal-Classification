Taiwan declined direct comment Friday on the US  decision to renew China's Most Favored Nation trading status, but suggested  that stronger US trade links with its political rival would aid the reform  process on the mainland.
"We have no comment on the US decision as we do not get involved in  US-communist China relations, just as we want communist China to stay away  from Washington-Taipei relations," a foreign ministry statement said.
But the statement added: "We believe economic development and expansion of  foreign trade on the mainland will help speed up social openness and political  reforms," it said.
At the same time, Taiwan said it "hoped the US government would not reduce  its concerns over human rights on the mainland."
Taiwan, which still considers itself the rightful ruler of all China and  is reluctant to be seen offering support to the government which chased if off  the mainland in 1949, refused official comment throughout the long MFN debate.
But analysts said here that renewal would clearly be to the benefit of  much of Taiwan's business community, because of its huge investments in China.
