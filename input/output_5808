The Republic of Ireland's veteran defender Paul  McGrath has emerged as a target for English First Division club Wolverhampton  Wanderers, as the Molineux club completed the signing of England winger Tony  Daley on Tuesday.
Wolves and former England manager Graham Taylor watched McGrath, 33, in  Ireland's 2-0 victory over Germany in Hanover on Sunday.
McGrath, who is battling to prove his fitness for the World Cup after  further problems with long-standing knee injuries, was brought to Aston Villa  from Manchester United by Taylor in 1989, when he was manager of the  Birmingham club.
Because of his age and length of service, McGrath is entitled to a free  transfer but, despite disciplinary problems including going missing on at  least three occasions, Villa Park manager Ron Atkinson has offered the player  a new contract.
Atkinson said: "I will be having talks with Paul later this week. We want  him to stay and he has been offered a good deal."
The Villa boss has slapped a 3.5 million pound price tag on another Eire  international, full-back Steve Staunton, 25, who is at the end of his contract  and has been linked with a return to his former club, Liverpool.
Daley, for whom Villa will receive 1.25 million pounds, has signed a  four-year contract with Wolves.
Villa face expensive ground improvement bills and chairman Doug Ellis has  told Atkinson if he wants to strengthen his squad he must sell players first.
