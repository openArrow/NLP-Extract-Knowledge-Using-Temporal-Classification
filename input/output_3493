Red carpets were out as the newly revamped parliament was put under tight  security for the occasion, to be marked by a 21-gun salute and a flyover by  air force Impala jets trailing the colours of the new South African flag.
The jets rehearsed with flights over Cape Town all day Monday, while the  band practiced the country's two national anthems, the white "Die Stem" (the  Voice) and the black "Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika" (God Bless Africa).
The new parliament comprises 252 ANC members, 82 from former head of state  and current second deputy president Frederik de Klerk's National Party, 43  from Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party, nine from  the white right-wing Freedom Front, seven from the liberal Democratic Party,  five from the black nationalist Pan Africanist Congress and two from the tiny  African Christian Democratic Party.
It is the country's first all-race legislative body, replacing the  segregated tricameral apartheid parliament that sat in separate chambers in  the same attractive complex nestled at the foot of Cape Town's imposing  landmark, Table Mountain.
After conducting business for years with a whites-only assembly, the  government had bowed to domestic and international pressure in 1984 to set up  the tricameral body, which consisted of one house for whites, one for  mixed-race "coloureds" and one for Indians -- but no blacks.
