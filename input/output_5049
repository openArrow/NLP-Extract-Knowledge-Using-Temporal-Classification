The opposition in Niger ended its 81-day boycott of  parliament Saturday, returning to the 33 seats it holds in the 83-seat  chamber, correspondents said.
The opposition walked out on March 8 in protest at what it called its  exclusion from the political process.
It launched a civil disobedience campaign with a demonstration here on  April 16 in which one person was killed and 24 injured.
The next day three opposition leaders, Mamadou Tanja, Andre Salifou and  Issoufou Assoumane, were detained but were freed four days later when the  govenment announced it would hold an inquiry into the violence at the April 16  protest.
The public prosecutor had the courts lift the parliamentary immunity of  the 33 opposition parliamentarians on April 23.
Last Friday, opposition lawmakers held talks with President Mahamane  Ousmane, asking him to drop legal proceedings against them and to give them  access to the state media.
Ousmane said on television late Friday that he would examine their  grievances and try to find solutions.
The opposition embarked on its boycott after the government dismissed its  claim for the 46 percent share of senior civil service posts it said it  merited by dint of its support level of 46 percent in the March 1993  presidential poll.
