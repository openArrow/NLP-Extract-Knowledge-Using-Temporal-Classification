Chemical Bank of New York has formally expressed  interest in opening a Philippine branch under a new law which allows foreign  competition in banking, Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said Monday.
Singson said that the US banking giant voiced its interest in a formal  letter to his office recently. He declined to give additional details.
He said that under the new law, Chemical Bank would be allowed to set up  six branches in the country -- three in areas of its choice and three in areas  subject to approval by the Monetary Board.
The bank already has Philippine exposure with its 12.5 percent stake in  Far East Bank and Trust Co., one of the Philippines' major banks.
Chemical Bank is the first US bank to express interest in opening shop  here under the bank liberalization law, which allows 10 more foreign banks  into the country aside from the four here now.
Two major Dutch banks -- ING Bank and ABN-AMRO -- have informed the  central bank of their intention to establish branches in the Philippines.
In addition to opening branches here, investors can, under the new law,  set up new banks in which they may own up to 60 percent in equity, or they may  buy up to 60 percent of an existing local bank. Foreign banks had been  previously limited to a maximum 40 percent ownership.
Only four foreign banks have been allowed to operate in the Philippines  since 1948 -- Bank of America, Citibank, N.A., Standard Chartered, and Hong  Kong Bank.
Analysts said the entry of more foreign banks would help bring in more  investments and increased competition would result in improved services. The  banking industry is currently controlled by a local cartel.
