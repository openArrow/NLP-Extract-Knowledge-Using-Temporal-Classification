<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><TimeML><TIMEX3 tid="t0" functionInDocument="CREATION_TIME"/>The emergence of a democratic South Africa has <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">got</EVENT>  businessmen in neighbouring countries <EVENT eid="e2" class="I_STATE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">worried</EVENT> about what impact it might have  on trade in the region.&#13;
Some <EVENT eid="e3" class="PERCEPTION" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">see</EVENT> post-apartheid South Africa as a threat, <EVENT eid="e4" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">fearing</EVENT> that foreign  investors might <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="might">divert</EVENT> their attention to the new democratic country because  of its vast economic potential and well-developed infrastucture.&#13;
There are also fears that South Africa might <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="might">dominate</EVENT> the region, <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">flooding</EVENT>  it with its exports.&#13;
But others <EVENT eid="e8" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">view</EVENT> it as a magnet to <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">attract</EVENT> investment and stimulate trade  within southern Africa.&#13;
Like many Zimbabweans, <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">visiting</EVENT> British investment expert Sir Terence  Streeton <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">admitted</EVENT> that the world is <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">looking</EVENT> at South Africa's potential, but  witha certain amount of circumspection.&#13;
"Foreign investors are at the moment reluctant to <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">commit</EVENT> themselves to  South Africa until they are <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">satisfied</EVENT> with the political developments there,"  he <EVENT eid="e15" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT>.&#13;
Fear of South African domination <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">stems</EVENT> from the scale of its economy,  which is three times the size of the 10 SADC (Southern African Development  Community) countries <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">put</EVENT> together.&#13;
The SADC nations are Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique,  Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.&#13;
Between 40 and 60 percent of the total SADC trade has been with South  Africa, which <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">enjoys</EVENT> an annual trade surplus of more than one billion (US)  dollars with the region.&#13;
In <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE">1991</TIMEX3>, South Africa <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">exported</EVENT> 3.76 billion dollars worth of goods to SADC  countries against imports of 668 million US dollars, <EVENT eid="e20" class="REPORTING" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">according</EVENT> to the  Harare-based Southern Africa Foundation for Economic Research (SAFER), an  independent economic research body.&#13;
However, some analysts are optimistic that the positive political <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">changes</EVENT>  in South Africa should <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="should">provide</EVENT> a fertile ground for improved regional trade  and investment.&#13;
In any case, South Africa will within <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION">the first years</TIMEX3>, concentrate on  domestic expectations of <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">correcting</EVENT> the apartheid legacies in such areas as  education, health, housing and unemployment which <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">discriminated</EVENT> against  blacks, and has <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">earmarked</EVENT> some 11 billion dollars of investment for the task.&#13;
"My personal view is that South Africa won't be much of a power to <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">shake</EVENT>  the region as it will <EVENT eid="e27" class="STATE" tense="FUTURE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">have</EVENT> its own domestic issues to <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">address</EVENT> - it will be  more inward <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">looking</EVENT> instead of outward," <EVENT eid="e30" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT> Joshua Mushauri, the executive  director of SAFER.&#13;
However, Mushauri <EVENT eid="e31" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT>, the entry of South Africa into the fold will  <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="FUTURE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">undermine</EVENT> a lot of the region's industry, as the newcomer's highly  sophisticated technology and production efficiency will <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="FUTURE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">result</EVENT> in inexpensive  goods of high quality.&#13;
Zambian Barclays Bank financial analyst, Dolika Banda, <EVENT eid="e34" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT> there was <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE">now</TIMEX3>  potential for more serious capital investment from South Africa, <EVENT eid="e35" class="REPORTING" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">adding</EVENT> that   Zambian companies were more ready for joint ventures with South Africans.&#13;
"But at the same time, one can <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="can">foresee</EVENT> a massive braindrain from this  country. Most Zambian professionals <EVENT eid="e37" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">think</EVENT> a new peaceful South Africa under  black rule will be a better place for greener pastures," Banda <EVENT eid="e38" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT>.&#13;
Mushauri <EVENT eid="e39" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT> the independence of South Africa will <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="FUTURE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">exacerbate</EVENT> the <EVENT eid="e41" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">drain</EVENT>  of both skilled and unskilled manpower from the region.&#13;
In varying degrees, southern African countries <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">depend</EVENT> on South Africa for  employment of their citizens.&#13;
Despite its former government's destabilisation <EVENT eid="e43" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">acts</EVENT> against neighbouring  countries, <EVENT eid="e44" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">causing</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e45" class="I_STATE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">estimated</EVENT> 60 million dollars of damage, the regional  countries have to <EVENT eid="e46" class="I_ACTION" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">accept</EVENT> South Africa like the biblical prodigal son.&#13;
