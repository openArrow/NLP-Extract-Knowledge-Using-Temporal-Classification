After years of struggling  with the occupying army to obtain passes to enter Israel, Gazans learned  Sunday they would now have to go through the new Palestinian police first.
"Requests will have to be made in our offices for our approval and then be  handed on to the Israeli army for their approval," a senior PLO official told  AFP.
Palestinians were not looking forward to the double procedure.
"Before I used to call the military administration and an army patrol  would accompany the Israeli lorry carrying gas bottles to my factory in Deir  el Balah," said factory owner Mohammad al Tilbani.
However, since Palestinian police took charge of the area last week the  deliveries have had to stop.
"So now I have to go and fetch gas myself from Israel. But when I called  the military administration, I was told from now on to go through the  Palestinian police.
"I made my request but they told me they were too busy deploying policemen  in different barracks and to come back tomorrow."
"I don't know how they will function in the future, all I know is that I  have 85 workers who have nothing to do and a Moslem holiday starts on  Saturday," said Tilbani, who makes cakes and biscuits.
"If we don't work now, people will buy Israeli cakes and our economy will  collapse."
The 3,900 Gazans with the old permits to work on Israelis farms  nonetheless went to work as usual on Sunday.
The permits will remain valid until their expiry date when the workers  will also join the queue outside the offices of the new force.
