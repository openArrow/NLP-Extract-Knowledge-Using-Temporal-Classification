Activity in central Kinshasa ground to a  standstill Friday as shops, offices and markets closed following a call for  public protest by the radical wing of Zaire's opposition.
Supporters of Etienne Tshisekedi, one of Zaire's rival "prime ministers"  and an implacable foe of President Mobutu Sese Seko, called on people not to  go to work to press for implementation of a transitional constitution.
Few vehicles took to the streets of central Kinshasa, and in outlying  districts of the capital, such as Massina, Lemba and Linguala, children played  football in wide avenues empty of traffic.
Trains owned by the private companies City-Train and Sotraz were running  but largely empty.
The radical wing of the Sacred Union opposition movement called for the  work stoppage after the transitional parliament seized all the files of  candidates for the post of prime minister.
The radicals consider Tshisekedi, who was appointed premier by a national  conference convened four years ago, the only opposition candidate, but  moderates in the Sacred Union have put up three other names.
Mobutu sacked Tshisekedi last year and appointed a new prime minister,  Faustin Birindwa, but the opposition leader has refused to recognise his  dismissal.
No trouble was reported during the protest Friday.
In Zaire's second city, Lumumbashi, capital of the mineral-rich  southeastern province of Shaba, work continued as usual, according to several  sources in the private sector reached by telephone.
Shaba has declared its autonomy, amid economic and political chaos in the  country.
