Formula One's drivers and team bosses backed new  safety measures here on Monday following the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland  Ratzenberger.
Drivers representatives Michael Schumacher of Germany and Gerhard Berger  of Austria took part in the meeting, which agreed unanimously to back the  decision announced by governing body FIA.
Benetton boss Flavio Briatore said: "All the teams are agreed over the  changes required for the Grand Prix of Spain."
Berger said a meeting of team engineers ended with even stricter safety  measures being suggested. The team bosses plan to approach FIA president Max  Moseley with their views.
Austrian Ratzenberger was killed in practice for the San Marino Grand Prix  and Brazilian Senna died during the race at Imola on May 1. Karl Wendlinger,  also of Austria, is currently in a coma after a crash in practice for the  Monaco race, won by Schumacher on Sunday.
FIA has suggested cutting car power, changing aerodynamics and adding  protection for drivers around their heads.
