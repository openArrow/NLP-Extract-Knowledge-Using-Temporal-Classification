A couple from Mali was given a four-year suspended  sentence Friday by a court in the Paris suburb of Bobigny, after mutilating  their two daughters by the traditional African practice of female  "circumcision."
The prosecution had asked the court to set an example in the widely  publicised case, which would send a message to the African community.
"I was circumcised at my birth, I wanted my children to be like me,"  explained mother Dembele Soumare, aged 34, who argued that she had not known  the operation was illegal in France.
Her husband Guessouma, 54, said he was not involved in the affair which he  described as "women's business which does not concern the head of the family."
The local hospital discovered that 12-month-old Fatoumata Soumare had been  infibulated -- a ring passed through the outer lips of her vagina -- and her  clitoris removed when she was hospitalised for an anaemic condition in August  1990.
Her sister Feta, aged three, was then examined by the emergency services  who found the clitoris and smaller vaginal lips removed, typical of the ritual  circumcision practised on young girls in around 30 African countries.
Dembele, saying she had acted alone, described meeting a circumciser who  brought her to an unknown address where she operated on the children as they  sat on the mother's knee.
"I did not look at what she was doing, I do not know what instrument she  used. My girls bled very little," she told the court. The operation cost 100  francs (17 dollars).
Her husband acknowledged knowing that the operation was illegal. "If my  wife had asked me I would have told her not to do it," he said.
A witness from the childrens' inspectorate who interviewed the couple  after their arrest contradicted this testimony, saying that at the time the  father defended the operation as a normal custom.
