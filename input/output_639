Nelson Mandela was taking a breather this  weekend at his home village in Eastern Cape province after a hectic two week  schedule that saw his inauguration as South Africa's first  democratically-elected president, the Sunday Times reported.
The newspaper said that Mandela issued instructions that no one be allowed  at his residence in Qunu village.
On Saturday he attended the funeral of Zwelinbanzi Hani, the father of  assassinated South African Communist Party chief Chris Hani who was slain in  April last year.
Mandela's African National Congress swept to power in the April 26-29  election, ending more than 300 years of white-minority rule.
