The UN food agency said Sunday the influx of  Rwandan refugees into Tanzania, already hosting more than 320,000 other  Rwandans, was continuing unabated with an estimated 1,400 people arriving  daily.
The World Food Programme (WFP) said in a statement released here that  although it had managed to deliver adequate food to northwestern Tanzania, the  refugees were threatened with an outbreak of epidemics because of poor  sanitation.
The agency estimates that 100 tonnes of human excrement is piling up daily  in Benaco, the world's largest refugees camp. The faeces flow down the hill  when it rains and contaminates the only source of water for the refugees.
Relief workers, including those from the Red Cross and Medecins Sans  Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) are working round the clock to improve  sanitation in the refugee camps, WFP said.
Impassable roads, lack of transport and storage facilities have continued  to hamper relief deliveries to the refugees fleeing tribal massacres in  Rwanda, where more that 200,000 people have been killed in five weeks of  ethnic bloodletting pitting the majority Hutus against the minority Tutsi.
Another 500,000 have fled to neighbouring countries.
Fighting between the mainly Tutsi Rwanda Patriotic Front rebels and  Hutu-dominated government forces intensified Sunday in the Rwandan capital,  Kigali and in several other towns across the country, a UN spokesman said.
The violence erupted after Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana was killed  in an alleged rocket attack on his plane over Kigali on April 6.
Food requirement for the refugees at Benaco camp is 4,600 tonnes a month  at an estimated cost of one million dollars, the WFP says.
