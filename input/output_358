Washington denies that Clinton has shifted policy on Kashmir, and says it  is a matter of Indian perception.
The US policy has always been the same - that the Kashmir dispute is  something that India and Pakistan should work out between them, taking into  account the wishes of the Kashmir people, the US official said.
Rao made it clear this week that he was not about to cause further  ructions at home by making any major concessions on the nuclear  non-proliferation issue during his Washington trip.
Another key element of the visit is the effort to boost the economic  relationship, which has taken off with the opening up of the Indian economy in  the Rao administration.
Rao arrives in New York Sunday for meetings with the large Indian  community there, then goes on to Houston for talks with business leaders.
He will be in Boston on Tuesday where he will give a lecture at Harvard.
The Indian prime minister's two-day stay in Washington on Wednesday and  Thursday includes a speech to a joint session of congress, and a two-  and-a-half-hour session with President Bill Clinton.
The two men are scheduled to hold a joint press conference after their  meeting Thursday.
Rao is also scheduled to have talks with Defense Secretary William Perry,  Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
