US Secretary of Secretary Warren Christopher  said here Tuesday that he would return to Syria after talks with Israeli  leaders.
"I am going back to Damascus for further discussions to try to find a  common basis between the parties," Christopher told reporters after meeting  Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
"I'll be stopping in Damascus on my way back to the United States," he  said, but did not specify when.
Christopher said he had Rabin's "encouragement" to return to Damascus  where he spent Sunday and Monday in talks with President Hafez al-Assad and  Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shara.
Officials said he was expected to go to Syria on Wednesday following up on  an Israeli peace package -- a phased withdrawal from the Golan Heights linked  to security arrangements in return for total peace.
In Cairo, the foreign ministry said Christopher was also expected in Egypt  on Wednesday.
