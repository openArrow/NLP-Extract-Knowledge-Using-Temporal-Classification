President Bill Clinton said Thursday that he  has not made decisions on whether to extend China's trade benefits and  defended his
the time he is taking to do so.
"It's a decision of great moment for this country that involves not only  the economic interests of the American people and the people of China ... but  also enormous national security interests and international security  considerations for a long time to come," he said.
Clinton, who must recommend to Congress by June 3 whether to renew China's  most favored nation (MFN) trade status, has said that China must make  significant progress on its human rights record before the extension is  granted.
"The decision is due to be made based on facts as they exist moving up to  the deadline of June 3 so that it would have been inappropriate to make a  decision in January, February or March," he said.
The president declined to comment on the talks with Beijing which he  announced earlier.
"We have not concluded our discussions with the Chinese and I think that  anything I say about them until they are concluded would be inappropriate," he  said was speaking at a joint press conference with Indian Prime Minister P.V.  Narasimha Rao.
