Senior Japanese and US trade officials began  talks here Thursday aimed at breaking a three-month deadlock in bilateral  trade negotiations.
Japanese deputy foreign minister for economic affairs Sakayuki Hayashi and  vice-minister at the international trade and industry ministry Sozabaru  Okamatsu made no comment as the entered the offices of the United States Trade  Representative (USTR).
Hayashi was expected to meet briefly with US Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor before the Japan representatives and members of the US trade  negotiating team sat down for talks.
US officials were cautiously optimistic Wednesday that the talks would  make progress, although they stressed that Thursday's meeting was "talks about  talks," not a full-fledged resumption of negotiations.
Both sides have said they are anxious to make progress before the Group of  7 summit in Naples in July.
Bilateral trade talks collapsed in February over disagreement on ways to  measure progress in reducing Japan's 60 billion dollar trade surplus with  Washington under an agreement reached in July.
