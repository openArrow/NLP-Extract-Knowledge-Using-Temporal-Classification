The Italian clothing firm Benetton increased net  profits by 12.6 percent in 1993 from the figure in 1992 to 208 billion lire  (122.3 million dollars), the company said Wednesday.
The board recommended a dividend of 385 lire from 350 lire last year.
Consolidated sales rose by 9.5 percent to 2,751 billion lire (1.61 billion  dollars).
At an extraordinary meeting, the board confirmed an increase in capital  which had been decided on at the end of April. This will be in the form of a  foreign placing of 19 million ordinary shares each of 20,000 lire, or through  the issue of a convertible bond.
Group president Luciano Benetton also said that within the next five years  he intended to issue another bond for a maximum of 150 billion lire.
"These operations to increase capital, and more generally to restructure  long-term debt, are intended to accelerate growth of the group through  acquisitions and big strategic investment," he said.
Senior executive Aldo Palmeri said that the group had not yet begun  negotiations on any eventual acquisition.
Palmeri said that once the debts had been restructured the company would  have net debt of only about 60 billion lire.
