Former Venezuelan president Carlos Andres Perez  was jailed Wednesday to face trial for allegedly skimming millions of dollars  from the public trough.
The Supreme Court ordered his detention after it finished compiling  evidence to begin a formal trial of the 71-year-old Perez, his former interior  minister Alejandro Izaguirre, and former aide Reinaldo Figueredo for  embezzling and misuse of public funds worth 17.2 million dollars from an  interior ministry slush fund.
Perez, who was suspended from office in May 1993 and became Venezuela's  first president to be impeached in August, is the first leader in the Americas  to be imprisoned after being elected head of state.
"I am going to defend myself and demonstrate that there was no real reason  to suspend me as president, to remove me from the office the people entrusted  me with, or to jail me," a defiant Perez said.
A social democrat who presided over Venezuela's oil boom from 1974-1979  and tough economic times from 1989-1993, Perez also served as the Socialist  International's number two to Germany's Willy Brandt.
He survived widespread rioting in 1989 that left more than 300 dead and  two army coup attempts in 1992. Wednesday, dressed in a dark bue suit, he  appeared calm under hot midday sun outside the high court.
"I am being tried and jailed for political reasons," Perez said. "Those  who could not overthow me or force me to resign unleashed an implacable  campaign to force to leave the presidency and then put me on trial."
Perez and Izaguirre were whisked to the headquarters of the Judicial  Technical Police and were to be transferred from there to the El Junquito  jail, said chief justice Roberto Yepes Boscan. Figueredo is still at large and  believed to have fled the country, possibly to Britain.
