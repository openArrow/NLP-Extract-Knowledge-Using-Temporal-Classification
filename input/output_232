Suspected Islamic militants shot dead three  policemen and wounded a fourth on Friday in the Asyut region, a fundamentalist  stronghold in southern Egypt, the interior ministry said.
The assailants sprayed automatic weapons fire at conscripts guarding a  police station in Badari, near Abu Tig, 400 kilometers (240 miles) south of  Cairo, killing two and wounding one.
A few hours later, Sergeant Abdel Mohsen Eteifi Nasser was shot dead as he  stepped out of his home in Abu Tig, and his machine-gun was stolen.
Both attacks were carried out by the same group, which managed to escape,  sources close to the security services said.
The latest killings bring to 138 the number of policemen murdered since  Islamic militants launched a campaign to topple President Hosni Mubarak two  years ago. The campaign has also cost the lives of 144 militants.
Almost two-thirds of the police victims died in the Asyut region, a  stronghold of the main militant group, Jamaa Islamiya.
