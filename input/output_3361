"We're going in the right direction," Solari said when he and his squad  arrived in the United States on May 17. "We will play as well as we can and we  know that anything is possible in 90 minutes."
Solari's assets include Majed Abdullah, the "Desert Pele," the 35-year-old  captain of the team who has been beloved in his country since his six goals in  four matches earned Saudi Arabia a place in the 1984 Olympic football  tournament.
When the Saudis arrived in Washington, children from the local Saudi  Academy presented Majed Abdullah with the bouquets, but the main goal scoring  responsibilities during the World Cup will likely rest with his younger  teammates Saeed Owairan and Khalid al-Muwallid.
The Saudis, who face the Netherlands, Morocco and Belgium in Group F, were  listed as 200-1 long shots by bookmakers. But they hope hope to duplicate the  surprise 1990 success of Cameroon, who reached the final eight in Italy.
The team's general manager Fahad al Bahmash made their intentions clear  when he declared: "We're here in search of a victory."
