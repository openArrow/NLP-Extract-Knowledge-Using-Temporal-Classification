French philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy has decided to  field a "Sarajevo" list in next month's elections to ensure that the Bosnian  conflict remains on the agenda for the European Union, his supporters said  Thursday.
Participants at a meeting Thursday decided to set up a list to be led by  cancer specialist Leon Schwartzenberg, and to be entitled "Europe begins in  Sarajevo."
Levy, an active supporter of the Moslems in the Bosnian conflict, is also  presenting a film on Bosnia entitled "Bosna" at the current Cannes film  festival.
He told French television on Sunday that it was "unthinkable that the  Bosnian issue is not at the heart of the European debate."
Socialist Party leader Michel Rocard attended a public meeting on Tuesday  to discuss Levy's initiative, which could draw votes from traditional  Socialist voters.
Former French humanitarian affairs minister Bernard Kouchner told Le Monde  newspaper on Thursday that while he welcomed reviving the Bosnian debate, to  go ahead with a political list in the elections "would be stupid."
He said it risked garnering only up to two percent of the vote, at the  expense of the left, and "people would only notice that France is not very  interested in Sarajevo."
The 12 European Union nations vote on June 9 and 12 to choose a new  parliament in Strasbourg.
