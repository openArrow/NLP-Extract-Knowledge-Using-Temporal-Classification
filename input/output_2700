Mustafa Dirani, who was abducted in a pre-dawn raid  Saturday by Israeli commandos, was the leader of an Iranian-backed Moslem  fundamentalist guerrilla movement which has claimed several anti-Israeli  attacks.
Until 1988 the bearded 46-year-old father of three was chief of security  for the pro-Syrian Moslem Shiite Amal movement.
He is accused by Israel of having captured airman Ron Arad, whose plane  was shot down over south Lebanon in 1986 during an Israeli air raid on a  Palestinian refugee camp.
Amal chief Nabih Berry, who is now speaker of the Lebanese parliament,  said four years ago that Dirani had sold Arad to Iran for half-a-million  dollars.
Dirani was ejected from Amal in February 1988 after he defended the  kidnapping in south Lebanon of Colonel William Higgins, an American officer  serving with the United Nations who was later killed by his abductors.
Diarni joined ranks with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and later along with  other former Amal militiamen set up the "Resistance of the Faithful", a group  with enjoys good relations with Iran.
An ex-officer in the Lebanese army, Dirani joined Amal in 1974.
He was wounded in the leg during combat between Amal and the army in 1983  and uses a cane to walk.
