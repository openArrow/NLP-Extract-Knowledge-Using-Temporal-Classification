higher. After a mixed beginning, prices lifted sharply on Thursday  to around 995 pounds per tonne at the close -- their highest level since the  end of March.
Dealers said the return of investment funds into the market boosted  prices, which had fallen over the past few weeks on temporary lack of interest.
Lawrence Eagle, analyst at GNI trade house, said the cocoa market appeared  fundamentally strong.
The International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) said it predicted a production  deficit of 95,000 tonnes for 1993-1994 (October-September).
Eagle said that after coffee and copper, cocoa would be the next market to  see sharp rises.
Elsewhere, Indonesia, which is one of the key world producers, rejected  invitations from ICCO to rejoin the organisation. The question will be  examined again in June at the next meeting of the ICCO.
COFFEE: sharp rises then technical fall. The price of robusta lifted above  1,900 dollars per tonne on Tuesday, its highest level for five years.
The extremely high prices for delivery in May and June were due to a  severe restriction in the supply of robusta and the short-term availability of  Colombian coffee.
Large-scale buying by investment funds on the London and New York markets  magnified the swift rise in prices, dealers said.
From Wednesday onwards, prices began to fall as speculators took profits,  but then rose again on Friday.
Investors' confidence was not dented by the fact that the Association of  Coffee Producing Countries (APPC) could henceforth sell some 50 percent of  their stocks accumulated in the agreed export retention plan.
The calculated index which fixes the level of retention has lifted above a  certain level and exporters can sell around 2 million sacks (each of 60  kilogrammes).
Brazilian exporters immediately announced the sale, from Wednesday, of  118,700 of the 650,000 sacks of coffee stocked since October 1, 1993 in the  retention plan.
