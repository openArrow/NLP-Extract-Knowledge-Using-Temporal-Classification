Turkish soldiers in the northern part of the  divided island of Cyprus are using German arms in violation of NATO  agreements, an official source said here Friday.
The Greek-Cypriot source, who asked to remain anonymous, said the 35,000  Turkish soldiers who have occupied northern Cyprus since 1974 were using arms  delivered to Ankara by Bonn.
The weaponry was delivered to Turkey as part of an agreement for  cooperation between members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.
He said that included among the arms in northern Cyprus were German  vehicles and anti-aircraft weaponry "which can only be used on NATO missions."  Some of the arms were German-made and others old stocks from the former East  Germany.
A German diplomatic source on the island said that arms delivered by Bonn  to Ankara were in principle limited "to a political framework for the defence  of NATO, which does not include northern Cyprus."
But he did not confirm whether German weaponry was on the island.
Government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said Cyprus had already lodged  several protests against "the use of arms coming from NATO by occupying troops  in Cyprus."
