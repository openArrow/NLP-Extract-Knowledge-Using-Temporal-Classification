French President Francois Mitterrand and  German Chancellor Helmut Kohl held talks in this eastern French city on Monday  focusing on preparations for a European summit and a Group of Seven meeting.
Kohl and Mitterrand are coordinating closely on European issues at the  63rd Franco-German summit as Paris will succeed Bonn as European president  following Germany's six-month stint beginning in July.
A summit of the 12 European Union leaders is to be held in Corfu next  month at the end of Greece's presidency.
A French presidential spokesman said that the two leaders would also focus  on the Group of Seven summit -- grouping Britain, Canada, France, Germany,  Italy, Japan and the United States -- in the Italian city of Naples in July.
Kohl and Mitterrand were applauded by several hundred people before they  began their first round of talks at the city hall here. Kohl was also due to  meet with conservative French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur.
The French president would host a banquet for Kohl later Monday and the  two would wrap up their summit on Tuesday by expanding negotiations to include  ministers.
Three ministers are accompanying Kohl -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel,  Finance Minister Theo Waigel and Defence Minister Volker Ruhe -- while  Mitterrand is with their French counterparts but also with his ministers for  communications, culture, European affairs, education, planning and transport.
