Palestinian fundamentalists shot dead two Israeli  soldiers at a petrol station on the edge of the Gaza Strip on Friday, the  Islamic Jihad claimed.
In Jerusalem, the army would make no immediate comment on the Islamic  Jihad claim sent in a statement to news agencies.
The group said it carried out a "heroic" operation near the Erez border  crossing before dawn.
Several fighters from the Jihad's Kassam unit had used American M-16 and  Israeli Galil rifles in the attack. "All the members of the squad returned  safely after completing their duty under God's protection," the statement said.
The petrol station is just inside the settlement zone controlled by  Israeli forces on the northern edge of the Gaza Strip.
Meanwhile, Israeli military officials said two Israelis driving a garbage  truck were wounded when Palestinians fired shots from a passing car near the  settlement of Morag, in the south of the Gaza Strip.
The attackers fled towards the town of Khan Yunes, which is inside the  autonomous Palestinian zone, the officials said.
Islamic Jihad has vowed to fight on against Israeli occupation despite the  autonomy agreement in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho.
Fundamentalists from the Islamic Resistance Movement HAMAS shot dead two  Israeli settlers south of Herbon on Tuesday.
Friday's claimed attack would the first killing of Israeli soldiers (eds.  correct) since Israel and the PLO signed an accord on May 4 to launch autonomy.
Under the agreement, Israeli forces are responsible for the safety of the  4,000 Jewish settlers on the Gaza Strip while the new Palestinian police  maintains order in the self-rule areas.
Israeli troops protect three main settlement areas, including the Erez  industrial and settlement zone in the north of the strip.
