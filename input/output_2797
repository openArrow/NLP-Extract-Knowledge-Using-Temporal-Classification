PLO leader Yasser Arafat pledged Saturday to found a  Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, the Palestinian WAFA agency  said.
In a speech marking the Moslem feast of Al-Adha, the Palestine Liberation  Organisation leader said the implementation of limited Palestinian autonomy in  West Bank town of Jericho and the Gaza Strip was a step towards realising that  ambition.
"We know we have not obtained everything we want, but this a step on the  long and hard road to Jerusalem," he added.
Arafat gave his speech outside the Palestinian martyrs tomb in a Tunis  suburb, and in the presence of members of the PLO's executive committee.
The Palestinian "vanguard" which has been deployed in Gaza and Jericho  "will also reach into all other Palestinian territories," he added.
Israel has consistently refused to discuss the status of Jerusalem in  negotations with the Palestinians, but the two sides are scheduled to broach  the issue within two years of the full implementation of Palestinian autonomy  in the occupied territories.
