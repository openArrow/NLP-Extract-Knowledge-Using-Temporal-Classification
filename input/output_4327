Hungary plans to open an international centre  here for training UN and NATO peacekeeping troops, a defense ministry official  was quoted as saying Thursday.
State Secretary Rudolf Joo told the daily newspaper Magyar Hirlap that the  centre would open within one to two months as part of Hungary's cooperation  with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation under its Partnership for Peace  program.
But he said the government would need help to finance the operation.
