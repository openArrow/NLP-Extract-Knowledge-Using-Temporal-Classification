French Defense Minister Francois Leotard said  Tuesday that the scientific community believed additional nuclear tests were  essential in order to develop the capacity to simulate tests in the laboratory.
Leotard, speaking on French radio, said that "the scientific community  tells us that we need a few more tests," and added that he had not met a  single scientist who believes otherwise.
"France must acquire as quickly as possible -- perhaps in seven, eight or  10 years -- the capacity to simulate tests that would allow us to test the  effects of a nuclear explosion," Leotard said. "That is essential for our  country if we are to remain a major power."
He said those opposed to nuclear testing are generally "politicians," an  apparent reference to President Francois Mitterrand who is against France  resuming nuclear.
Mitterrand, who has exclusive powers to order tests, wants to stand by a  moratorium observed by all the United Nations Security Council members except  China.
