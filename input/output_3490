Thorn EMI, the British music and electrical  equipment giant, on Tuesday announced a 19.3 percent rise in annual pre-tax  profits at 326.5 million pounds (489.75 million dollars) compared with 273.5  million pounds the previous year.
The results, for the year to March, were lower than analysts' expectations  of between 339 and 360 million pounds.
Sales were down 3.7 percent at 4.29 billion pounds from 4.45 billion the  previous year.
Chairman Sir Colin Southgate said the results for the year "revealed  strong performances from the music, rental and music retailing businesses --  EMI, Thorn and HMV -- and good progress in the divestment of non-strategic  businesses."
Southgate said operating profit rose 21.5 percent to 382.4 million pounds  for the group's principal businesses.
Earnings per share were up at 47.7 pence from 43 pence, while the dividend  was up at 34 pence from 32 pence.
