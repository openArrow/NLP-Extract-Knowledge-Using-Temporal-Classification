Mozambique's RENAMO armed opposition is promoting  its leader to be the sole opposition candidate in October's presidential  elections, observors to the first national congress of opposition parties said  Thursday.
The two-day congress which opened on Thursday in the southern town of  Xai-Xai said it was clear that RENAMO was manoeuvering to have Afonso Dhlakama  proclaimed the opposition's champion in the contest with incumbent President  Joaquim Chissano.
According to MONAMO, one of the participating opposition parties, RENAMO  funded the congress in an apparent move to pull the non-armed parties under  its more powerful wing.
The only major contestants for the October general elections are the  former insurgent Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO) and the ruling  FRELIMO (Mozambique Liberation Front) party who signed a peace accord to end a  17-year civil war in 1992.
Opinion polls consistently favour FRELIMO over RENAMO which is held  responsible for most war-time atrocities.
RENAMO already has links with nine smaller opposition parties and now  seems to be taking advantage of divided opinion in some of the larger ones,  like FUMO and PCN, whose members are split between supporting Dhlakama or  other presidential candidates.
FUMO's leader Domingos Arouca is boycotting the opposition congress,  claiming RENAMO only funded it to rally support for Dhlakama, the Noticias  daily reported.
Other matters for discussion at the opposition congress, include  management of a United Nations Trust Fund designed to aid Mozambique's mainly  new political parties campaign for the nation's first ever multi-party  elections.
