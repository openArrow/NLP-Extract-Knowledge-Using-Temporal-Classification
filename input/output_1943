China on Wednesday denied as "groundless" reports  that a law suit had been filed against Wei Jingsheng, saying the country's  most famous dissident was under surveillance.
"Wei Jingsheng is now under surveillance," foreign ministry spokesman Wu  Jianmin said at a weekly press briefing.
"He remains under surveillance, but to allege that a law suit has been  filed against him is totally groundless," said Wu.
Although the English translation of Wu's remarks suggested that no suit  would be brought in the future, the spokesman subsequently made clear he was  talking only about "now" and declined to elaborate.
The public security ministry issued a denial Wednesday of a western press  report that it had announced a formal decision to try Wei and had handed the  case over to the courts.
The foreign ministry also denied Wednesday separate reports that China was  preparing to file treason charges against the 44-year-old dissident, who was  released from prison in September just six months short of a 15-year sentence  for "counter-revolutionary" crimes.
