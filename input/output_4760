An Indian court on Friday banned local liquor  giant McDowell and Co. from using a label patented by Scottish distiller  William Grant and Sons Ltd. for their popular Glenfiddich brand of whisky.
Judge Mahinder Narain Singh of the Delhi High Court upbraided McDowell's  for plagiarism in a 54-page judgement, saying the label and the "single malt  whisky" endorsement were copyright infringements.
"The court orders the company to stop manufacturing, selling, advertising  and dealing in alcoholic beverages under the brandname "McDowell's Single Malt  Whisky," it said.
The company was also asked to change the shape of and colour of the  bottles apart from the label following a suit filed by James Grant alleging  that they resembled Glenfiddich packaging.
Glenfiddich is sold around the world in green bottles bearing an intricate  label with the words single malt whisky embossed on it. The bottles are packed  in a cylindrical container.
Scotch whisky, unavailable here legally, fetches huge prices in the black  market. The majority of Indians are whisky drinkers.
