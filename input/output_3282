Italian veteran Moreno Argentin took over the  lead in the Tour of Italy here on Monday by winning the 231km second stage --  then openly defied race favourite and world number one Miguel Indurain.
Gewiss rider Argentin, who led the Giro for ten stages last year, took 21  seconds off the Spaniard before saying: "I prepared specifically for this race  and I think I can win it, even if Indurain is still favourite.
"It's the only race which really motivates me."
The 33-year-old, in his 15th professional season and who won the Fleche  Wallone classic earlier this seaon, yet again proved his strength in hill  finishes, beating fellow Italians Andrea Ferrigato and Davide Rebellin by six  and eight seconds after attacking in the final kilometres.
Indurain finished 16th. Argentin's Russian teammate Evgeni Berzin, the  1990 amateur world pursuit champion who won the Liege-Bastogne-Liege classic,  is second overall, nine seconds behind, with France's Armand de la Cuevas  16secs off the pace.
