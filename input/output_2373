The Black Sea fleet, shared between  the Ukraine and Russia, threatened Friday to intervene in Crimea after the  region's parliament adopted a new constitution effectively declaring  independence from Kiev.
"It is clear that whatever the development of the situation, the Black Sea  fleet cannot remain outside events unfolding around it," the fleet's press  office said in a statement.
