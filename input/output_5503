Severiano Ballesteros says he will skip  the US open next month if he is not given an automatic place.
The Spaniard had hoped to avoid having to qualify for Oakmont by staying  in the top two of Europe's Order of Merit.
But his eighth place finish in the PGA Championship here sent him down to  fourth in the table, behind Jose Maria Olazabal, Ernie Els and Colin  Montgomerie.
Ballesteros said: "If they don't invite me I will not not play.
"I have won the Benson and Hedges International this month and my record  speaks for itself.
"It's not a matter of pride. I just feel I deserve an invitation.
"If they don't invite me it means I am not welcome and that's alright by  me.    "I will just prepare for the British Open instead. That's the best of  all tournaments.
"I have been 20 years on tour and I have proved myself. I don't think I  have to prove anything."
David Fay, the US Golf Association's executive director, said there would  be an announcement after a committee meeting on Monday, where the issue would  be discussed.
He added: "I don't know which way it will go. I haven't polled the  committee."
