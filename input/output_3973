President Bill Clinton reiterated US  commitment to helping enforce an eventual peace settlement in Bosnia on  Wednesday.
Clinton defended his policy in the former Yugoslavia and promised the  United States would play its part in policing an eventual peace accord between  the warring factions.
He blasted calls for the United States to unilaterally break the UN arms  embargo on the former Yugoslavia and supply weapons to the out-gunned Moslem  forces in Bosnia.
In his speech to a graduating class at the Annapolis, Maryland, naval  academy, Clinton said he supports arming the Moslems, but said doing so  without support from the United States' allies is a "simplistic" option.
Speaking just a week from his departure for Europe for D-Day  celebrations, he said the United States would use its power depending on the  weight of US interests and "in Bosnia we have a clear interest in preventing a  broader European war."
However, the war will only be ended in Bosnia when the parties reach  agreement at the negotiating table, he said.
