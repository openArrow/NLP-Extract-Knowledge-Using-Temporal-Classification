The death from cancer of Jacqueline Kennedy  Onassis, 64, widow of former US President John Kennedy and Greek shipping  magnate Aristotle Onassis, left Greece unmoved Friday.
"We have absolutely nothing to say," a spokesman for the Onassis  foundation said to AFP Friday.
Greece's press and television reported the death of Jacqueline Kennedy  Onassis with suggestions that the former US First Lady had married the  shipping magnate more for money and prestige than for love.
Five year's after her first husband was assassinated, Kennedy married  Onassis, a quarter-century her senior. At the time, Greece was ruled by a  military dictatorship which Onassis was said to lean towards.
Onassis, one of the richest men in the world, remained popular in Greece  but Jackie Kennedy was apparently little liked.
