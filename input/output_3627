The Japanese held the record for life expectancy  for both men and women in the latest annual statistics published Tuesday by  the World Health Organisation.
In 1993, Japanese women had an average life expectancy of 83 years, ahead  of their counterparts in France (82), Switzerland (81.7), Canada (81) and  Australia (80.8).
Japanese men had an average life expectancy of 76.3 years, against 75.1  for their counterparts in Israel, Sweden (74.9), Australia (74.8) and Greece  (74.7).
"The world health statistics annual presents detailed statistical  information useful in monitoring trends in health status and causes of death,"  explained Hubert Dixon of WHO's division of epidemiological surveillance.
For the first time the document also included data on the new independent  states of the former Soviet Union. Countries with populations of less than  500,000 were not included in the survey.
