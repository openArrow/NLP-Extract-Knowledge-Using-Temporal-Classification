A man carrying a home-made bomb was killed early  Saturday close to the Miss Universe 1994 contest venue, police said.
The victim, believed to be between 35 and 40, died instantly after the  explosive went off as he was on a Manila bay seawall. The beauty contest went  ahead as planned less than a kilometer (half a mile) away.
Manila detective Conrado Bustillos said police were investigating the  possibility the man planned to disrupt the beauty pageant, which was to start  four hours after the explosion.
Another explosive went off in a garbage bin just outside the Philippine  International Convention Centre, the contest venue, on Thursday night, but  organizers dismissed it as a publicity stunt by opponents of the event.
The Miss Universe contest started on schedule and there was no immediate  comment from organizers.
