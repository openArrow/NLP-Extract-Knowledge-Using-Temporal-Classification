Prices on the London Metals Exchange (LME) suffered  some correction in volatile trading on Wednesday after rising to record highs  on Tuesday on further downdraws in copper stocks, dealers said.
The market remained very nervous about the possibility of a major  technical correction following recent strong gains, traders said.
Copper closed down 17 dollars at 2,280 dollars per tonne, while lead was  down three dollars to 502 dollars per tonne and zinc was down 17 dollars at  978 dollars per tonne.
Australian geologists said on WeDnesday that they had recorded an  earthquake measuring 6.7 on the Richter scale in the highlands of Irian Jaya,  the site of Freeport Indonesia's Grasberg copper mine.
But local company officials could not be reached during the day for  further details, traders said.
Traders at GNI predicted that on current levels, a supply deficit of  around 375,000 tonnes could be seen this year, enough to provide support to  prices on any dip, and possible drive them up to around 2,600 dollars per  tonne.
Nickel extended Tuesday's fall on Wednesday, slumping 150 dollars to close  at 6,580 dollars per tonne, as the market believed trading conditions were  likely to remain volatile in view of the on-going labour talks at Canadian  producer Inco.
Inco has begun preparations for a possible strike next week at its  Sudbury, Ontario, nickel operations, as the current labour contract is set to  expire at the end of this month.
The market believes Inco has the ability to continue nickel deliveries for  only three weeks in the event of industrial action, which workers have voted  for if the contract is not renewed.
The factory produces around 9,000 tonnes of refined nickel per month,  around nine percent of western production, said John Bergtheil, analyst for  Metals and Minerals Research Services.
Aluminium was 4.5 dollars lower at 1,368.5 dollars per tonne, while tin  was unchanged at 5,635 dollars per tonne.
