Japanese trading house Mitsui and Co. Ltd. said  Thursday its pre-tax earnings tumbled 21.5 percent from a year earlier to 46.5  billion yen (451 million dollars) in the year to March.
But the leading company within the Mitsui group said overall sales edged  up 2.4 percent to 15,863 billion yen in the same period, supported by a surge  in revenue from non-ferrous metals trading.
Mitsui forecast a modest increase in profit to 47 billion yen in the  current year although sales are projected to retreat to 15,000 billion yen.
