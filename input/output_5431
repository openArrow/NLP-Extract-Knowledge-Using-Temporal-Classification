The Spanish Iberia airline company lost some 13.6  billion peseta (100 million dollars) in the four months of the year, the  company said Monday.
Turnover during the first four months was 149.7 billion pesetas, up by  about 8.1 billion compared to the same period last year.
Iberia's subsidiary, Aerolineas Argentinas, for its part made 1.8 million  dollars in the first quarter, compared to losses of 58.4 million dollars  during the same period last year.
In 1993, Iberia registered after-tax losses of 69.7 billion pesetas (500  million dollars), compared to a deficit of 34 billion the previous year.
The doubling of losses was due to the economic crisis, devaluation of the  peseta and the transfer of financial resources to Latin America.
