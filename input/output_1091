Northern Yemeni forces Monday seized the main  air base in the rival south.
An AFP photographer saw about 50 northern soldiers on the outskirts of the  Al-Anad base and on two main roads leading to Sanaa in the north. The base is  about 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of the southern stronghold of Aden.
The official news agency of the north, SABA, had reported the fall of the  base earlier in the day but this was denied by a southern military spokesman.
The two sides lurched into civil war on May 5 after months of arguing over  how to run the country, formed from the unification of conservative North  Yemen and the poorer, Marxist South Yemen.
