Argentina's World Cup hope Diego Maradona put  his turbulent past behind him on Monday to deposit a pray in a crack in the  Wailing Wall.
Maradona donned a Jewish skullcap to leave a little written note at the  holiest site in Judaism, but he refused to disclose if he asked for God's help  in winning the 1994 finals in the United States.
He earlier shook hands with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and gave him the  team's pennant ahead of Tuesday night's World Cup warm-up against Israel in  Tel Aviv.
