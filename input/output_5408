Mauritius has decided to make entry visas  obligatory for Indians visiting this Indian Ocean island as part of its drive  against drug trafficking, it was announced here on Monday.
Several Indians have been arrested recently and charged with trafficking.
The Mauritian information industry said New Delhi had agreed to the move,  and that India and Mauritius were cooperating closely in the fight against  narcotics.
The death penalty for drug trafficking exists here but has not been used.
The ministry said Bombay and New Delhi had taken measures to facilitate  the granting of visas to businessmen and tourists.
More than half the population of Mauritius is of Indian origin, from  indentured labourers imported in the last century after the abolition of  slavery, and the island is visited by around 10,000 Indian tourists annually.
