Hundreds of Tibetans formed a human chain in a  downtown park here Monday to mark "International Quit Tibet Day," witnesses  said.
Wearing identical white T-shirts with "China Quit Tibet" in black  lettering on the front, the nearly 1,000 demonstrators held hands, chanted  anti-Chinese slogans and sang the Tibetan national hymn.
"We want justice, we want freedom," they cried, holding up banners reading  "Let Tibet be for Tibetans" and "Stop Chinese population transfer to Tibet."
They denounced Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng and praised Tibetan  spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, who lives in the northern Indian hill town of  Dharamsala. "Long live the Dalai Lama," they said. "Down with Li Peng."
A spokesman for the Tibetan Youth Congress (TYC), which organized the  demonstration, said events would be held in at least 12 countries to mark  "International Quit Tibet Day."
He said a petition with tens of thousands of signatures would be submitted  to the White House in Washington and protests would be held in Australia,  Britain, Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Nepal, New Zealand,  Sweden and Switzerland.
In a statement, the TYC accused the Chinese authorities of "redoubling  their efforts to obliterate the very identity of the Tibetan people from the  face of the Earth" and called for support from the international community.
The Dalai Lama has made his home in India since 1959, when he fled Tibet  following an abortive anti-Chinese uprising. His government-in-exile, which is  not recognized by any country, is based in Dharamasala.
