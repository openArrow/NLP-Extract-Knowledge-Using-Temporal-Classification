The two-month-old cub of a cougar  killed after it attacked a jogger has attracted more donations than the  children of the dead runner.
As of late last week, the cub had received 21,000 dollars in donations and  the children of jogger Barbara Schoener 9,000 dollars.
But when a radio talk show host complained to his listeners about the  disparity on Tuesday donations for Andrew, 8, and Anna, 5, more than doubled,  although their father, Peter Schoener asked that the exact amount be kept  confidential.
"We've had a wonderful response," said Pattie Cornell, who started the  trust fund for the Schoener children at the US Bank in Placerville.
Schoener, 40, was training for a marathon when she was killed April 23 by  a mountain lion in El Dorado County. Trackers used dogs to hunt the animal and  kill her. Her one-month cub was found nearby.
