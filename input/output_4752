Italian Marco Saligari won the sixth stage  of the Tour of Italy here on Friday after a 210km five-man breakaway.
Saligari's triumph, just over three minutes ahead of the peleton following  a sprint to the line, gave him an unusual hat-trick, allowing him to record a  stage win for the third Giro running.
Overall leader Evgeni Berzin of Russia retained the pink jersey at the end  of the 215km run.
The 29-year-old Italian winner, who won last year's Tour of Switzerland,  stole away from the pack with fellow Italians Massimo Ghirotto, Ivan Gotti and  Gianni Faresin, as well as Heinz Imboden of Switzerland. Ghirotto came home in  second.
