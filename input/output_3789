Japan's Nippon Steel Corp. said Wednesday it would  provide British Steel with technology to produce steel sheets for use in car  manufacturing.
Nippon Steel said a two-year agreement signed recently called on the  world's largest steelmaker to dispatch 50 engineers to British Steel and  accept 232 trainees from the London-based company.
"We will provide British Steel with our advanced technology, beginning  this month," Nippon Steel said in a statement.
