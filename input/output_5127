The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has  rejected a proposal to keep nuclear material from a reactor in North Korea "in  a safe place, under seal" an IAEA source confirmed Sunday.
Dimitri Perricos, head of the IAEA's team of experts in North Korea, who  left Pyongyang Saturday, said in Beijing, "the North Koreans proposed a  procedure which was not workable on a technical front."
IAEA experts here said storing the nuclear rods would not have allowed the  agency to verify whether any had been diverted for the possible manufacture  nuclear weapons.
"The only effective method of control is to immediately stop the  downloading of the reactor and take samples from the nuclear rods," one expert  said.
"The North Koreans have said it would cost too much to stop the  downloading of the reactor."
Two IAEA inspectors at Yongbyon continue to observe the operations at the  reactor.
The United States and IAEA officials have said repeatedly that they do not  think North Korea has been using the downloading of the reactor to divert  nuclear material to a possible weapons programme.
But they think the previous occasions, dating back to 1989, have been used  to build up a stockpile of weapons-grade material.
"The only means of verifying that is to take samples which can tell us  with certainty the progress of the nuclear material since the reactor was  brought into service in 1986," an IAEA expert said.
