The Frontline States, a southern African group set  up to fight apartheid, is to meet here Friday to review its role following the  inauguration of democracy in South Africa, the Zimbabwe government said  Tuesday.
The one-day summit, to be attended by South Africa's first black president  Nelson Mandela, "will map out new strategies for the group, which previously  spearheaded the struggle against colonialism and apartheid in southern  Africa," said foreign ministry official Stan Chigwedere.
Zimbabwe currently chairs the seven-member group, founded 15 years ago.
Earlier this month, Zimbabwe's foreign minister Nathan Shamuyarira said  there was "no longer a frontline" and the region needed to shift "from  disengagement to intensive engagement at various levels" to promote peace and  stability on the sub-continent.
Mandela is due to arrive Friday while others will come as early as  Tuesday, the ZIANA news agency said. All seven countries in the group are  expected to be represented by their heads of state.
The other leaders include Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola, Sir Ketumile  Masire of Botswana, Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, Sam Nujoma of Namibia, Ali  Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania, Fredrick Chiluba of Zambia and Robert Mugabe of  Zimbabwe.
