Three youths accused of murdering U.S. student  Amy Biehl in a black township near here last August were Monday freed on bail  of 250 rands (70 dollars) each in the Cape Town Supreme Court.
State prosecutor Nollie Niehaus said the three all had fixed addresses and  he had no reason to believe they would abscond.
He said the amount determined for their bail was "reasonable" in the light  of their economic backgrounds and had been discussed with their parents.
The three have been held without bail since their arrests in September.
Biehl, a 26-year-old graduate student, was stoned and stabbed to death by  a mob in Guguletu township on August 25 after she had entered the area to drop  off a friend.
Those charged are members of the student wing of the hardline Pan  Africanist Congress.
