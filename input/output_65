Police arrested some 50 people Thursday  after right-wing youths armed with knives and sticks chased foreigners through  the eastern German town of Magdeburg, injuring two of them seriously.
A 40-strong group of football fans attacked foreigners over several hours  after parading through the town centre giving Nazi salutes, a police spokesman  said.
"They indulged in a real hunt," the spokesman said.
Three of the foreigners, whose nationality was not specified, received  knife wounds and two were brought to a nearby hospital in a serious condition.
Two of the attackers were also lightly wounded and police were trying to  determine whether a sixth person injured, a German, was one of the aggressors.  A nightclub was seriously damaged during the fighting.
The extremists later attacked a cafe where their victims had taken shelter  before more than 200 police arrived on the scene, arresting both extremists  and foreigners, the spokesman said.
The entire police force had been placed on general alert during the  rampage, he added.
Extreme-right violence caused 22 deaths in Germany last year compared to  15 in 1992, but the number of attacks had dropped in the first few months of  this year.
