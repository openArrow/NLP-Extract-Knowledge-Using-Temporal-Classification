The heads of state of Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and  Zaire will meet in the Kenyan capital on June 6, to discuss the Rwandan  crisis, officials here said on Saturday.
The meeting is being convened by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi.
Moi told a gathering in the central district of Muranga on Friday that  neighbouring counties should not "sit back" and watch mass killings in the  central African state without taking action.
Rwanda descended back into tribal bloodletting a day after president  Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in an alleged rocket attack on his plane on  April 6.
Some 200,000 to half-a-million people have been killed in ethnic massacres  pitting Habyarimana's majority Hutu tribe against minority Tutsis.
The mainly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) rebel movement went on the  offensive against government troops and Hutu militia in an attempt to stop the  massacres and grab power from the Hutu-dominated government.
The RPF has since besieged the capital, Kigali, and after seven weeks of  fighting, battle-weary government forces are reportedly fleeing the city.
