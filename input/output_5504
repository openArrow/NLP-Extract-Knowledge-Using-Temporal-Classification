Rwandan rebel and army commanders agreed Monday to  allow the evacuation of civilians and to resume UN-brokered ceasefire talks on  Thursday.
The accord was announced by the commanders after their first face-to-face  meeting at the Amahoro Hotel.
United Nations troops meanwhile evacuated hundreds of civilians trapped  for weeks behind the battlelines to safe areas, after an early morning delay  caused by fierce artillery duels and difficulties in obtaining guarantees of  security from both sides, UN officials said.
Mainly Hutu government supporters were driven in white UN trucks from the  Amahoro stadium, in rebel-held territory, to government-controlled areas south  of the embattled capital Kigali.
