A federal judge sentenced one of four Moslem  fundamentalists to 240 years in prison Tuesday for the bombing of the World  Trade Center last year.
Mohammed Salameh, 26, Mahmud Abouhalima, 34, Niddal Ayyad, 26, and Ahmad  Ajaj, 28, were convicted March 4 of all counts in the February 26, 1993  attack, which killed six people and injured more than 1,000.
Salameh, who drove the van that carried the bomb, was sentenced to 240  years in prison. The sentences of the other three were pending.
US Distric Judge Kevin Duffy said he arrived at the sentence by  calculating the number of years of life the victims were deprived of -- 180 by  his estimate -- and then added 30 years for each of the other two counts  against him.
The explosion in the heart of New York City's financial center was the  first of its kind in the United States and raised fears it announced the  arrival of the scourge of Middle East terrorism.
The four were accused of making a huge but unsophisticated bomb and  parking it under the 110-story twin towers of the World Trade Center in a  rented van and then detonating it.
The explosion ripped a 200 foot- (35 meter-) crater, hurled parked cars  around, and caused the roof of the mezzanine of an adjacent train station to  collapse, trapping dozens of people.
The four were quickly arrested -- easily traced by the FBI because Salameh  had used his own name in renting the van and a storage locker where the  materials used in building the bombs were made.
Abouhalima helped build the bomb, Ayyad ordered chemicals used in making  the bomb and wrote a letter to the New York Times claiming responsibility for  the attack, according to evidence presented at their trial. Ajaj was accused  of bringing a bomb-making manual when he arrived in the United States  September 1, 1992.
