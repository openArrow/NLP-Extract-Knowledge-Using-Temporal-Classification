Swiss Finance Minister Otto Stich told parliament  Tuesday he was budgeting for a record 8.6 billion francs (about six billion  dollars) for 1995.
Reform of federal finance has become the government's main concern, he  added.
If such reform were not rapidly introduced, Switzerland would find itself  facing a 100 billion franc (71 billion dollar) in three years' time, he said.
