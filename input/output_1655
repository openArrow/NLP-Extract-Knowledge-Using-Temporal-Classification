US Secretary of State Warren Christopher left for  Egypt on Wednesday at the end of a peace shuttle between Syria and Israel  aimed at forging an accord between the arch foes on the disputed Golan Heights.
Christopher has been mediating indirect negotiations between Syrian  President Hafez al-Assad and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, whose  country has offered a phased withdrawal from the Golan over several years.
The US envoy held four hours of talks Wednesday with Assad, in their  second meeting in as many days, and left without making any statements.
The Syrian press on Wednesday said Damascus rejected any phased withdrawal  from the Golan, which Israel conquered in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed  in 1981.
At the start of his mission on Sunday the Syrian official press called for  a rapid withdrawal from the Golan and urged a "reasonable and acceptable"  timetable for a pullout.
The Golan has been the main stumbling block between Israel and Syria since  the launch of Middle East peace talks in October 1991.
Peace talks between Syria and Israel have been suspended since the Hebron  massacre on February 25 when a Jewish settler killed 30 Arab worshippers.
