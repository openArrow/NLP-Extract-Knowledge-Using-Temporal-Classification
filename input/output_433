Former French minister Bernard Kouchner called on  the international community Saturday to help avert "genocide" in the  ethnically divided country.
"We cannot stand by and let genocide be perpetrated," said Kouchner, who  arrived here on Thursday and spent Friday touring orphanages and camps for  people made homeless by the five-week conflict.
Kouchner, a doctor who founded the medical charity Medecins Sans  Frontieres, told reporters the international community must shoulder its  responsibilities and address the "gigantic humanitarian problem" in Rwanda. He  is a former socialist minister for humanitarian action.
The UN Security Council delayed a vote Friday until next week on a plan to  deploy 5,500 UN troops to Rwanda to reinforce a UN mission reduced to 270  members.
Kouchner has held talks with both sides in the conflict, which flared  between the ethnic minority Tutsis and majority Hutus following the mysterious  plane crash death of Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana on April 6.
"I would like to persuade both sides of the need to protect civilians,  women and children," of whom 20,000 are "displaced" in Kigali, he said.
He held talks in northern Byumba with rebel leader Paul Kagame, whose  Rwandan Patriotic Front is drawn from the Tutsis, and in Kigali with the  Rwandan army chief of staff, general Augustin Bizimungu.
More than 100,000 people have been killed in the latest fighting.
