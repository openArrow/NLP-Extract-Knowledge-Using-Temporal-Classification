Veteran US film star Clint Eastwood, the  president of this year's Cannes festival jury, was awarded the French National  Order of Arts and Letters here Sunday.
French Culture Minister Jacques Toubon bestowed the award on Eastwood in a  ceremony also attended by Federico Mayor, secretary general of UNESCO,  reminding the actor-turned-director that he first came to fame in Europe.
Toubon thanked Eastwood for "the pleasure you have given us in cinema" and  noted: "It was in Europe that Clint Eastwood first became popular, thanks to  the films of Sergio Leone, before becoming a big star in his own country."
During the 47th Cannes International Film Festival, Eastwood is staying in  a retreat in the hills outside Cannes.
