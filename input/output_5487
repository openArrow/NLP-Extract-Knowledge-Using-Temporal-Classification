The dollar and the German mark remained stable on  the money market here Monday, with little trading as markets in London and New  York remained closed because of bank holidays.
The dollar ended the day here at 1.6470 German marks compared to 1.6440 at  Friday's close, 5.6280 French francs (5.6210) and 104.68 yen (104.40).
"The greenback is still subject to strong dowward pressure" but it remains  anchored above the 1.64 mark level as operators believe it would otherwise  benefit from central banks' intervention, an analyst at Forex Finance said.
In early May, the US and European central banks intervened to prop up the  greenback.
The French franc remained stable ending the day at 3.4170 to the German  mark (3.4177 on Friday).
