Australia's new opposition leader, Alexander  Downer, named a new shadow cabinet Thursday, promoting his deputy to the post  of treasury spokesman.
Downer, who ousted former Liberal Party leader John Hewson in a party  ballot on Monday, named his running mate Peter Costello as spokesman on   economic affairs.
As leader of the Liberal Party, Downer also heads the conservative  coalition opposition, of which the country-based National Party is a junior  partner.
Downer gave Hewson a senior job as industry spokesman and appointed  Bronwyn Bishop, once touted as a potential leader of the party, as health  spokeswoman.
The shadow cabinet, which sits on the front bench in parliament, was cut  to 32 members from 37 under Hewson. The Labor government of Prime Minister  Paul Keating has 30 ministers.
Health Minister Carmen Lawrence said moving Bishop to be spokeswoman on  health was a blatant attempt to bring about a head-on clash between the  country's two leading women politicians.
