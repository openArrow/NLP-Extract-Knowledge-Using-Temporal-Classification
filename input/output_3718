A French football manager who admitted  injecting valium into an opposing team's water bottles received a six-month  suspended sentence Tuesday and a 5,000-franc (900-dollar) fine.
It was the second trial for manager Marcel Leveille of the Sully team for  the incident which happened at half-time in a February 1993 game against  Salbris. Both towns are in central France.
In the first trial, in October of last year, Leveille was acquitted of  charges of administering harmful substances when he used a syringe to squirt  the sedative into bottles of mineral water of the other team.
The court apparently accepted his lawyer's argument that Leveille had used  so little valium that even drinking a whole bottle would not have been toxic.
The Salbris coach and one of the players appealed that ruling.
Under the new verdict by a court of appeals in Orleans, they will each  receive one franc (20 US cents) in damages, as will the regional football  federation, which barred Leveille for the next 10 years.
At the first trial Leveille blamed his behavior on depression stemming  from what he called unfair sanctions by the federation against three Sully  team officials.
"I guess I wanted to make a gesture," he told the court.
