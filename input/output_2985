Liverpool came from behind to defeat English  Premier Division rivals Aston Villa 2-1 at Ellis Park here Sunday in the  opening match of a week-long South African football festival.
A crowd of 20,000 braved freezing weather to see Neil Cox put  understrength Villa ahead in the 24th minute after goalkeeper David James  failed to cut off a deep cross.
Liverpool, well marshalled by former England player John Barnes in  midfield, were more creative and deservedly equalised after 30 minutes through  livewire striker Robbie Fowler.
The decisive goal came 12 minutes into the second half when unmarked  midfielder Michael Thomas hammered a cross from Fowler past Mark Bosnich from  close range.
Bruce Grobbelaar, given a free transfer by Liverpool after refusing a  one-year extension to his contract, was included at the sponsor's request and  received thunderous applause when he replaced James.
The festival continues Tuesday night when Villa face local club Manning  Rangers in Durban and two days later Liverpool meet Cape Town Spurs.
