Fittipaldi has the top practice lap of 230.483 mph (368.772 km/h), with  Brazil's Raul Boesel next best at 230.403 (368.644 km/h) followed by Tracy,  Unser, Eddie Cheever, Mansell, Mario and Michael Andretti.
"If we can make the front row, it would be a real coup," said Michael  Andretti, making his Indy return after spending last season on the Formula One  circuit.
Those top drivers are aiming for the speedway records, set in 1992 by  Roberto Guerrero, of 232.618 mph (372.188 km/h) for one lap and 232.482 mph  (371.971 km/h) for a four-lap qualifying run.
"There is no more pressure-filled day in racing than pole qualifying  here," said Mario Andretti, a three-time Indy pole winner in his 29th and  final 500. "Qualifying for this race is an event in itself. It's the only race  where you have a week to get going as fast as you can just to get into the  race."
Owner-manager Derrick Walker, a former Penske chief, said he expected a  pole speed above 234 mph (374 km/h). "Jesus," said stunned driver Mark Smith  upon hearing the prediction. "I was hoping he would say 227 mph," added racer  Robby Gordon.
The fastest rookie is Villeneuve, son of the late Formula One racer Gilles  Villeneuve. He has reached 226.637 mph (362.619 km/h) in a Reynard-Ford. Other  rookies above 220 mph (352 km) are Adrian Fernandez of Mexico, Brazil's  Mauricio Gugelmin and Matsuda.
Lyn St. James, the only female driver here, reached 225.749 mph in  practice Friday, the top speed ever recorded for a woman racer.
