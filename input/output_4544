South Korea's largest shipyard is facing a strike  after workers at Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. informed the government Friday  that a labor dispute had broken out there, union leaders and company officials  said.
The move opened the way for the shipyard's 23,000 workers to strike after  a 10-day obligatory cooling-off period, a labor union spokesman said.
One of the stickiest issues is the union's demand that management allow  the union to set up a committee of 13 workers on full pay to protect workers  from industrial accidents.
The proposed committee would have the authority to stop work when  necessary to protect workers from accidents. The union made the demand after a  worker died in a fall earlier this month.
"This is a preposterous demand. The company will never accept it," said a  Hyundai spokesman.
The workers also disagreed with the management over wage hikes, calling  for a 12.6 percent increase, compared with a five percent raise offered by the  company, the Hyundai spokesman said.
Strikes at the giant shipyard have often ended in violence, spilled over  to other Hyundai subsidiaires in Ulsan and triggered labor disputes in other  industrial cities.
The government hopes to hold wage rises to less than 10 percent this year  to bolster the competitiveness of the country's exports.
