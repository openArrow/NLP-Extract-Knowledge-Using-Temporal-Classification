Authorities in China's southwest province of  Yunnan are to seek overseas financing, including from the Asia Development  Bank, to construct a 1,350-kilometer (905-mile) railway link through Laos and  Burma to Thailand.
The railway will link Kunming with Bangkok.
Tan Zhongwei, head of the foreign economic and trade department of  Yunnan's provincial planning commission, told the China-backed Ta Kung Pao  newspaper Thursday that the provincial authorities had given the project the  green light so long as it had overseas fundings.
The aim was to establish an export outlet for the landlocked region.
Tan said the local authority had approached the Asia Development Bank for  funding last year and planned to follow-up this year.
He said initial estimates showed that at least 700 million dollars would  be needed for the 800-kilometer (536-mile) railway section within Chinese  territory.
Yunnan authorities have already set up a feasibility study group and  discussed the project with Thai authorities who are said to be interested.
The projected rail link will follow the route of the Mekong river to  exploit its undeveloped natural resources.
