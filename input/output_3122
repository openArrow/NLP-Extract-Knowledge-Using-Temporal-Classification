Steffi Graf wasted no time and dropped only four  games as she launched her bid for a fourth French Open singles crown on a  sun-drenched centre-court at the Roland Garros Stadium here on Monday.
The 24-year-old world number one, who needed just 57 minutes to defeat  Slovakian Katarina Studenikova, will now face either Natalia Medvedeva of the  Ukraine or Stephanie Rottier of the Netherlands.
Graf, hoping to achieve a second career Grand Slam following her triumphs  at last year's Wimbledon and US Open and this year's Australian Open, was  always in charge -- although both players were well below their best.
The 21-year-old Studenikova, more at home on harder surfaces and also a  first-round loser when she made her debut here twelve months ago, was clearly  overwhelmed by the occasion and the surroundings.
She double-faulted six times and made a score of unforced errors.
Graf, who has dominated women's tennis since the stabbing and subsequent  absence of her great rival Monica Seles at Hamburg last year, also made many  uncharacteristic errors and was often wayward with her first serves.
