The Netherlands criticised France and Britain  here Tuesday for threatening to withdraw their troops from Bosnia-Hercegovina,  a Dutch NATO source said.
He quoted Dutch Defence Minister Rebus Ter Beek as saying that threats of  unilateral withdrawal jeopardize the safety of other nationalities making up  the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia.
Ter Beek made his criticism at a meeting of defence ministers of the North  Atlantic Treaty Organisation.
German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe said the meeting expressed agreement  that there should be no more unilateral decisions or statements about troop  withdrawals from Bosnia.
The ministers also agreed that any discussions of troop withdrawals should  be conducted in private, and made public in the media only when final  decisions were made.
Ter Beek asked British Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind to ensure that  Britain made no more withdrawal threats.
Last week France, followed by Britain, said it could withdraw troops from  Bosnia unless there was new progress towards peace there.
Ter Beek addressed his remarks only at Britain because France was not  represented at the meeting of defence ministers, not being a member of NATO's  integrated military structure.
But the Dutch source said the criticism was intended equally for Paris.  France has about 6,800 troops in ex-Yugoslavia, and Britain about 3,000. The  Netherlands also has about 3,000 troops in the UNPROFOR force.
Ter Beek also urged a more equitable sharing of UN peace-keeping costs  around the world, saying that the Netherlands was paying more than its fair  share relative to its size.
He put the Dutch peace-keeping bill, mainly in Bosnia, at 350 million  guilders (about 185 million dollars).
