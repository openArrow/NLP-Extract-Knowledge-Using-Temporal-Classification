West Indian bowler Courtney Walsh produced a brave  display of batting to keep his English county, Gloucestershire, alive in the  only substantial action of a rain-hit Saturday.
John Wood had bowled Durham to the verge of their second victory of the  season against at Gateshead Fell, bagging five for 43.
But despite claiming the extra half-hour, Durham failed to separate the  ninth-wicket pair of Walsh and Martyn Ball.
Walsh hit a ball from David Graveney into his foot and had to call for a  runner, but survived for 13 overs before retiring hurt.
The umpires then called off play because of bad light with 4.2 overs  remaining and Gloucestershire were 196 for eight, still 113 behind.
Needing 310 to win the battle of last season's bottom two clubs,  Gloucestershire looked unlikely to survive the day when they slipped to 19 for  three.
But a fifth-wicket stand of 97, the highest of the match, between Tony  Wright and Tim Hancock, held up Durham for 41 overs until 23-year-old  Yorkshireman Wood was called upon to bowl downhill for the first time in the  match.
Walsh and company will now be praying that the rain edges north in time  for Monday's resumption.
The only other play saw Yorkshire put on 31 runs in their second innings  against before Headingly too fell foul of the weekend washout.
