The United States will contribute six million  dollars to the international court for war crimes committed in the former  Yugoslavia, the White House said Tuesday.
The designation of funds for supplies and services was included in a  memorandum from President Bill Clinton to Secretary of State Warren  Christopher.
The UN Security Council passed a resolution a year ago establishing the  court, which is to identify and prosecute war crimes committed during the  conflict in the former Yugoslavia.
The court was set up in The Hague last November.
