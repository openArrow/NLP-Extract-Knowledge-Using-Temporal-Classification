Honda's struggling Indy-car engine  effort faces elimination from the Indianapolis 500 this weekend during the  final time trials for the May 29 race.
The Honda-powered Lolas of Bobby Rahal and Mike Groff are the slowest of  the 30 now qualified for the 33-car field. Neither car reached competitive  speed in two weeks of practice.
Once the field is full, cars can only qualify by bumping out the slowest  qualified vehicle. That makes Groff's 218.808 mph and Rahal's 220.178 mph the  marks for everyone to beat.
"We have to go back to the drawing board," said Robert Clark, Honda  development general manager in charge of the Indy-car effort.
Groff had several blown engines and both he and Rahal never challenged for  top speed in the Hondas.
"Each engine we've lost we have shipped back, torn down and had examined  to find out exactly what went wrong," Clark said. "Some of it was inherently  designed into the engine and it's going to be difficult designing that out of  it in the short term. But all of the things we have learned here this month  can be put toward a better engine next go round."
Honda wants to develop an engine that could challenge Cosworth as the  standard for most Indy-car teams. The lackluster Indy effort has been a  setback, but engineers are already working on a new design.
"How much of a redesign is required I don't know," Clark said. "We've got  to come up with a good, consistant package that is attractive to other teams  and we have to do it soon."
