A Swiss doctor was wounded by shrapnel outside  Kigali on Thursday while escorting a truckload of food to needy civilians on  the front line between rebel and government forces, a Red Cross official said  Thursday.
Philippe Gaillard of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)  said he "strongly suspected" that rebel guerrillas, who opened fire on a  convoy carrying a former French government minister on Sunday, were  responsible.
Gaillard declined to name the doctor, whose wounds were not  life-threatening.
He was hit in the side by rocket fragments and evacuated aboard a United  Nations armoured personnel carrier to an ICRC field hospital in Kigali, where  an ethnic bloodbath has claimed an estimated 500,000 lives in six weeks.
Gaillard said commanders of the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front had assured  him that if their fighters had been responsible for the attack on the convoy,  in which all vehicles were marked with the Red Cross emblem, it was a mistake.
"I cannot afford this kind of mistake," Gaillard told AFP by telephone  from Kigali.
The doctor had been taking food and medicine to displaced people encamped  in various locations south of the capital where rebels are advancing towards  the seat of Rwanda's rump government at Gitarama, 40 kilometres (25 miles)  southwest of Kigali.
Earlier 30 wounded people were killed when mortar shells slammed into  Kigali's main hospital, in a government-held area and situated near a big army  base, Camp Kigali. An unknown number of people were wounded.
About 12 shells hit the UN compound in Kigali on Thursday but nobody was  hurt, UN spokesman Abdul Kabia said.
Shelling shook Kigali on Thursday after several relatively quiet days as  army gunners pounded rebel headquarters at the former parliament building and  RPF artillery units returned fire from the surrounding hills, Kabia said.
