Brain tissue was lifted from cadavres  by staff in 14 German hospitals and sold to a drug company without the  knowledge of the hospital authorities, North Rhine-Westphalia health minister  Franz Muentefering said Friday.
Reporting the findings of an investigation into 22 hospitals and two  private institutes, he said the practice had occurred in 14 hospitals in the  German regional state.
In one case, a staff member sold the brain tissue despite being forbidden  by management to do so, and only in three cases was there agreement between  hospital management, doctors and the buyer, Muentefering said.
The brain tissue was sold to the firm Braun Melsungen AG which wanted it  for the preparation of pharmaceutical products.
The minister said all the "dubious" cases had been reported to the state  prosecutor, but that several proceedings had been abandoned for lack of  relevant legislation.
