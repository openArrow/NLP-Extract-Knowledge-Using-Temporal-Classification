Play at the Byron Nelson Golf Classic was  rained out again on Friday, jeopardizing chances that at least three rounds  could be played by Sunday.
The saturated Tournament Players Club course at Las Colinas had another  inch of rain dumped on it early Friday.
Officials had hoped to start play Friday afternoon, but conditions would  not allow it.
Tournament chairman Plack Carr said two courses, the TPC and the  Cottonwood Valley course nearby, would be used on Saturday. The field of 156  will be split, and once players complete 18 holes they will change courses and  play until nightfall.
"Few of our players will have played 36 holes, but we believe all of them  will have played 27 holes," said PGA Tour official Duke Butler.
The second round was scheduled to be completed Sunday morning, with the  final round later in the day.
Weather could still thwart the plans. Thunderstorms were forecast for  Friday night and Saturday morning.
"In the event of further inclement weather, we will meet again and decide  what to do," Butler said.
