The Swiss insurance group  Winterthur said Tuesday it expected an improved performance this year, further  boosting last year's net profits of 324 million francs (231 million dollars).
The group's business saw "a very good progression" in the first months of  this year, the group's director Peter Spaelti told an annual press conference  here.
Premiums expressed in Swiss francs were up nine percent in the first  quarter, he said, adding that these results did not include those of the  German Deutsche Beamten Versicherung which the company has just bought.
DBV premiums, for their part, were up 18.7 percent in the first quarter at  more than 4 billion marks, Spaelti said.
Acts of God, including the Los Angeles earthquake and flooding in the  northeastern United States, would affect profits, but "it is realistic to  expect a new increase of our results" this year, Spaelti also said.
Last year's profits were up 31.3 percent on 1992.
