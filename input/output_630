Japan Tobacco Co., a former public corporation which  went under private management in 1985, is to be listed on the stock market in  October, a newspaper said Sunday.
Some 660,000 of its two million shares currently held by the government  will be released on the market in October, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said.
The finance ministry first wanted to list JT in fiscal 1992, but abandoned  the plan because of the sluggish Japanese stock market.
