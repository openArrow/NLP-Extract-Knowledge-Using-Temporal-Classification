<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><TimeML><TIMEX3 tid="t0" functionInDocument="CREATION_TIME"/>A special assembly of federal members of parliament  and regional delegates <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">meets</EVENT> in Berlin next <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE">Monday</TIMEX3> to <EVENT eid="e2" class="ASPECTUAL" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">choose</EVENT> the first head of  state of a reunited Germany in what promises to be a close-run vote.&#13;
The assembly has to <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">find</EVENT> a replacement for the popular and well-respected  Richard von Weizsaecker, aged 74, who will have <EVENT eid="e4" class="STATE" tense="FUTURE" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">served</EVENT> the maximum of <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION">two  five-year</TIMEX3> terms <EVENT eid="e5" class="I_STATE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">allowed</EVENT> by the constitution and therefore must <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="must">retire</EVENT>.&#13;
Everyone <EVENT eid="e7" class="I_ACTION" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">agrees</EVENT> that this gentle aristocrat who successfully <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">incarnated</EVENT>  the moral conscience of modern Germany during a time of upheaval and change  will be a hard man to <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">follow</EVENT>.&#13;
Four candidates are <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">running</EVENT> in the <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE">May 23 vote</TIMEX3>, which comes ahead of a  general legislative election in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE">October</TIMEX3> amid an unusually marked lack of  consensus among the parties over this largely honorific post.&#13;
Although once <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">elected</EVENT> the head of state is <EVENT eid="e12" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">supposed</EVENT> to be above party  politics -- Weizsaecker was from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrat  Union (CDU) -- the post is being bitterly fought over by the parties.&#13;
The favourite is Roman Herzog, a CDU politician and expert in  jurisprudence with a clear-cut conservative reputation, who is <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE">currently</TIMEX3>  president of the German constitutional court.&#13;
Herzog, aged 60, is the candidate of Chancellor Kohl's rightwing CDU and  its ultra-conservative Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU).&#13;
He is the conservatives' second candidate, after Kohl's personal choice of  Steffen Heitmann, from eastern Germany, was <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">forced</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">drop</EVENT> out of the race  because of controversy over his outspokenly rightwing views.&#13;
<EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">Running</EVENT> against Herzog will be Johannes Rau, 63, the candidate of the  opposition Social Democrats, (SPD), who has been premier of the important  regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia for <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DURATION">the last 15 years</TIMEX3>.&#13;
Rau is a well-known and popular figure, both within his party and in the  country at large, and if there were a vote by universal suffrage he could be  <EVENT eid="e16" class="I_STATE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="could">expected</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">win</EVENT>, <EVENT eid="e18" class="REPORTING" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">according</EVENT> to opinion polls.&#13;
