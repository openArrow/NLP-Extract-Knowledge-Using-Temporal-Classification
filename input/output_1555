The United States, from 1988 to 1992, approved  at least 1,500 exports of nuclear-related equipment to companies or  organizations suspected of involvement in nuclear proliferation, a  congressional report says.
More than half the exports went to organizations linked to Israel's  nuclear program while the rest were sent to Argentina, Brazil, India, Iraq,  Iran, Pakistan and South Africa, countries suspected of developing nuclear  weapons, the General Accounting Office (GAO) said in a report issued Tuesday.
The exports were authorized only after pledges that the equipment not be  used for weapons development, but the GAO said that although it found no  evidence of illicit diversion, the government had made little effort to verify  the pledges.
"These approvals increase the risk that US exports could contribute to  nuclear proliferation -- in some cases significantly," GAO director Joseph  Kelley told a Senate governmental affairs committee hearing Tuesday.
The GAO's 22-month study said that the equipment exported included  high-speed computers, lasers, oscilloscopes, furnaces, metallic compounds,  machine tools and other items, with a total value of more than 350 million  dollars.
Some of the equipment exported to Israel included computers that were more  powerful than those used by the United States in developing nuclear weapons,  the 22-month study said.
Other exports included 33 shipments of equipment to India's Bhabaha Atomic  Research Center, which the US Central Intelligence Agency suspects is working  on a hydrogen bomb.
