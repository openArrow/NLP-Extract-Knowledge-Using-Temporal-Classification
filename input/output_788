A former police officer shot four teenage  boys after reporting his home vandalized, killing two before he turned his gun  on himself.
Joseph Merola, a former officer in this central New York state town, shot  at the four when they bicycled past his house Saturdary. He had called police  20 minutes earlier reporting vandalism at his house.
Authorities did not release the names of the boys, but said they were  between 14 and 16 years old.
Neighbors said Merola lived alone, kept to himself and was not friendly.
