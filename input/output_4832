It is too early to tell whether allowing Gerry  Adams, president of the IRA's political wing, to visit America earlier this  year was a mistake for the peace process, US President Bill Clinton told the  BBC Friday.
"I don't think we can know yet whether the decision was or was not a  mistake in terms of what will happen over the long run. I think plainly it was  designed to further the debate and I hope it did that," he said.
Referring to a recent exchange of questions and answers between Sinn Fein  and the British government over the December 15 declaration for peace in  Northern Ireland, he added: "I'm very frankly pleased that at long last they  issued their questions and the British government provided answers and all  that's been published.
"And I'm hoping that after the June... (European) elections that we'll see  some real progress there."
In a wide-ranging interview with the BBC, Clinton defended his foreign  policy against charges of vacillation, and stressed there would be no  weakening in his determination to establish a credible vision.
The Clinton administration earlier this year, concluded Adams was opposed  to violence, and agreed to his 48-hour visit to New York to take part in a  forum on Northern Ireland.
But Adams has so far refused to respond to the Anglo-Irish declaration  which offers Sinn Fein a place in talks once the Irish Republican Army  renounces violence.
However, following the British government's partial clarification of the  declaration, Adams has promised to respond after the June 9 European elections.
