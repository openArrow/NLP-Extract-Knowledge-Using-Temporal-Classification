The dollar fell against other major currencies  here Friday in a quiet market ahead of a long holiday weekend, reversing an  early rise after a surprise upward revision of first-quarter US economic  growth.
The dollar's failure to break through resistance at the 1.65-mark level  sent it tumbling, said Bob Newman, a trader at American Security Bank.
Gold meanwhile was up 1.20 dollars an ounce at 385 dollars from late  Thursday.
At about 1:30 p.m. (1730 GMT), the dollar traded at 1.6433 German marks,  down from 1.6502 in early trading and 1.6480 late Thursday.
Against the yen, it was at 104.26, down from 104.68 in the morning and  104.65 the night before.
The greenback fell to 5.6172 French francs from 5.6300 late Thursday, to  1.4025 Swiss francs (1.4065) and to 0.6623 pound sterling (0.6627).
Newman said the market was quiet as many traders were absent ahead of the  long Memorial Day holiday weekend.
The Commerce Department said US gross domestic product rose three percent  in the first three months, up from an initial estimate of 2.6 percent growth.  Most experts had forecast a downward revision to 2.4 percent.
