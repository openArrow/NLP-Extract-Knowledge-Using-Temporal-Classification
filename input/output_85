Pioneer psychoanalyst Erik Erikson  who widened the scope of psychoanalytic theory to take greater account of  social, cultural and other environmental factors, died Thursday. He was 91.
Erikson died at the Rosewood Manor Nursing Home, said Diana Eck, a Harvard  professor and friend.
"As they used to say of Gandhi, he was a mahatma, a great soul, very wise,  very wide-ranging humanist and someone who really illuminated the stages of  the life cycle from birth to death," Eck said.
Erikson trained under Anna Freud -- the daughter of Sigmund Freud --  specializing in child pyschology. Erikson graduated from the Vienna  Psychoanalytic Institute.
He extended Freudian theory into adolescence and adulthood and coined the  phrase, "identity crisis."
He wrote numerous books on human development and was recognized in his  field as a pioneer. His most influential book was "Childhood and Society"  (1950).
His psychohistorical studies, "Young Man Luther" (1958) and "Gandhi's  Truth" (1969), explored the convergence of personal development and social  history. The latter won the Pulitzer and National Book Award in 1970. Later  works dealt with ethical concerns in the modern world.
In addition to psychoanalytic works, Erikson also wrote biographies of  Jesus, Albert Einstein, William James and Charles Darwin.
Born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany on June 15, 1902 to Danish parents,  Erikson left Europe for the United States in 1933. He became a naturalized US  citizen in 1939.
Erikson taught at Harvard University in the mid-1930s and returned during  the 1960s. He was professor emeritus of human development and psychiatry at  Harvard.
In his last years he had been living at the nursing home. His wife, Joan,  lived nearby.
