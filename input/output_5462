Leicester City made it third time lucky as they won  promotion to the English Premiership by coming from behind to beat favourites  Derby County 2-1 at Wembley.
The Foxes had lost the last two Division One play-off finals, to Blackburn  Rovers and Swindon Town, and a third defeat looked likely when Tommy Johnson  atoned for an earlier miss by putting the Rams ahead with a sweet left-foot  shot in the 27th minute.
But then defender-turned-striker Steve Walsh, who had missed eight months  of the season with a knee injury, vindicated manager Brian Little's decision  to pair him with the towering Ian Ormondroyd up front.
Two minutes before the break, with referee Roger Milford failing to  penalise Welsh international Iwan Roberts for an apparent foul on Derby  goalkeeper Martin Taylor, the ball fell to Walsh, who bundled it into the net,  its spin bewildering defender Paul Williams on the line.
Probably the turning point of the match came some ten minutes from time  when US World Cup player John Harkes missed a glorious chance, hitting wide  after Leicester defender Colin Gibson had slipped.
Leicester took the initiative and in the 87th minute Walsh pounced on  Taylor's parry from Ormondroyed to drill home from six yards.
The Filbert Street club, relegated seven years ago, now join Crystal  Palace and Nottingham Forest back in the top flight.
