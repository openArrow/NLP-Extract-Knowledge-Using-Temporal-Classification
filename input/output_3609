Hungary is to stage its first-ever beauty pageant  for horses in the southern city Bekescsaba in mid-June, organisers said here  Tuesday.
More than two-year-old well-trained horses which do not kick or bite and  pass a dressage test are eligible to win valuable prizes along with their  trainers, the organising Centaur riding club said.
Competitors should apply before June 4, club members said.
