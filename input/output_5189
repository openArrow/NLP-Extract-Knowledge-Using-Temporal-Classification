Colombia and Peru have been retaliating against  the United States for abruptly cutting them off from intelligence on drug  trafficking, The Washington Post reported Sunday.
The dispute arose over Colombia and Peru's use of US flight tracking data  to locate aircraft suspected of carrying drugs and forcing or shooting them  down, the Post said.
The Pentagon argues that any attack on civilian aircraft is illegal under  international law, and worries that providing the data could lead to the  accidental downing of a civilian aircraft, according to the Post.
On May 1, the US Southern Command suspended operation of US ground-based  radars in Peru and Colombia and stopped allowing their nationals on US  surveillance flights from Panama, the report said.
Peru retaliated by banning US AWACS and P-3 surveillance craft from its  airspace, while Colombia threatened to expel the US radars from its territory,  the Post said.
The Post said the Pentagon's actions were the source of a bitter dispute  with the State Department, which favors a policy of "don't ask, don't tell" --  providing tracking data, but publicly expressing disapproval of attacks in  flight.
Originally, the tracking information was supposed to be used with other  information to locate and destroy drug labs on the ground.
But on November 4, Peruvian aircraft shot down a suspected drug plane near  Pucallpa, Peru and Colombia also announced its intention to shoot down  suspected drug flights.
Nearly a 1,000 flights a year carry some form of cocaine or heroin north  from Peru and Colombia, according to the Post.
