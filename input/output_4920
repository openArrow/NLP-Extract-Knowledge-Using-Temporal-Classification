Northern Yemeni tribesmen have released three Dutch  hostages they kidnapped two months ago, a Yemeni leader told AFP Saturday.
The official, who asked to remain anonymous, said two were released late  Friday in the Marib region, east of Sanaa and were due to leave Yemen for the  Netherlands late Saturday.
A third was freed 10 days earlier because he was in bad health, he said.
The three, Wilbert Elderhorst, Gerard Jeuissen and Jac van der Gun, were  working on a project supplying drinking water to the capital Sanaa, when they  were seized on March 25 by the Jihm tribe.
More than 20 foreigners have been kidnapped in the past two years in Yemen  by different tribes, who use them to put pressure on the government to win  material gains.
All have been released unharmed.
Fighting has been raging between rival north and south Yemeni forces since  May 5.
