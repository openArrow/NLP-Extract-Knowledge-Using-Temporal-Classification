At least 500 police, army and border guards  Monday scrambled to track a pet Indian python, identified as a potential  strangler, MTI news agency said.
More than three metres (yards) long and seven centimetres (almost three  inches) thick, the snake escaped from its owner's flat Sunday in southern  Zalaegerszeg.
The owner, a 39-year-old electrician, said the animal was not venomous but  could strangle anyone trying to capture it. Experts fom Budapest Zoo said its  recovery was a question of luck as it had left no trail.
