Arab Moslem intellectuals united with their  western counterparts on Monday in denouncing the "fatwa" pronounced against  British writer Salman Rushdie five years ago by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah  Khomeini.
Rushdie was sentenced to death for blasphemy by the former Iranian  spiritual leader for the publication of his novel "The Satanic Verses."
Some 60 writers, sociologists and journalists, European and Moslem,  meeting here for a seminar, organised by the Danish section of the Pen club,  acknowledged that "certain books can offend the feelings of believers, who  have the right that their faith and religion be respected."
But the private seminar condemned, without specifically naming Rushdie,  "all recourse to acts of violence or appeals to violence, above all the death  sentence, torture, arrests, imprisonment, attacks under any forms on writers,  whatever their race, sex, religion, nationality or persuasion."
The Egyptian sociologist Saad Eddin Ibrahim and the Tunisian dissident  Rachid Ghannouchi, who lives in exile in London, were prominent speakers at  the symposium.
