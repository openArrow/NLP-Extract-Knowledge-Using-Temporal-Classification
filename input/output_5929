The Security Council agreed Tuesday on the  text of a draft resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Yemen, and  for the resumption of talks between northen and southern forces, the council  president said.
Council president Ibrahim Gambari of Nigeria said the draft resolution  should be adopted Wednesday.
It also calls for a UN mission to be sent as soon as possible to evaluate  the outlook for resuming the dialogue between the warring parties, Gambari  said.
Earlier in the day in Sanaa, a senior northern official warned that the UN  Security Council must recognize the unity of Yemen or the government will  reject its peace efforts and fight on.
Deputy Prime Minister Abdelwahab al-Ansi said the Security Council "cannot  stop the legitimate forces" from fighting for unity.
"Anything which does not recognise unity and the election results, or  which does not halt interference from neighbouring countries, will be  rejected," he told AFP, referring to last year's parliamentary elections.
Northern troops loyal to President Ali Abdallah Saleh and southern forces  have been at war since May 5, four years after the former conservative North  and Marxist South merged to form a united Yemen.
