Carothers stresses that for the White House Haiti is really a domestic  problem. "Florida has become an obsession of the Clinton team. They want to  win Florida in '96. It was very close in '92," he said.
With 27 electoral votes, or one-tenth the number required to win the White  House, Florida is the most important electoral prize after California. Clinton  lost it by two percent of the vote in the past presidential elections.
"The second factor is simply the sense of powerlessness and humiliation of  being defeating by these people," Carothers said.
"There is a general sense of frustration," he said, likening Clinton's  predicament to that faced by Bush in his standoff with Panama's general Manuel  Noriega.
Bush ordered US troops into Panama in December 1989. "It's hard to know  when a president reaches the breaking point," he said.
According to Carothers, the Pentagon and the State Department oppose  intervention, but the White House takes a different view.
"This is the division: between the professionals and those who think in  political terms," he said.
In his view considerations of domestic politics will carry greater weight  in the president's decision to use force than will the objections of Latin  American coutries leery of a big stick approach by Washington.
