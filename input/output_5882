US Senator Sam Nunn, head of the Armed Services Committee, said North  Korea must realize that the United States and its allies are serious about  keeping controls on nuclear technology in Korea.
"North Korea has to realize this is not an area that America is going to  back down," said Nunn in a television interview.
And he warned that if the crisis sparked a war North Korea would be  crushed.
"North Korea would be devastated and I think that regime would be  completely destroyed if there was a war," said the senator.
North Korea has protested that any attempt to impose sanctions on them  would be taken as an act of war.
Nunn said Russia, Japan and China would have to play key roles in  convincing North Korea to allow full inspections of their nuclear sites.
"The international community has got to join together and say to the North  Koreans,'You must be part of this overall international cooperative effort,'"  said Nunn.
North Korea maintains its nuclear program has only peaceful ends, but the  United States has suspected it is producing weapons.
