England crashed to their fourth  South African tour defeat in five matches here Tuesday, going down 16-19 to a  makeshift South Africa A side.
Once again, the tourists were outscored two tries to one and ultimately  succumbed to a late field goal that broke a 16-all deadlock.
Hero for the combined side was fly half Joel Stransky who contributed 14  points with a try, two penalties and the all-important drop goal seven minutes  from the end.
England's points came from a 27th minute try by winger Damian Hopley which  was converted by replacement fullback Jonathon Callard, who also potted three  penalties.
The Englishmen looked to have at last thrown off their shackles in the  early stages when they dominated all phases to lead 10-3 at the break.
But they were unable to maintain their momentum as the pace picked up in  the second half and the A side exploited defensive lapses.
An unlucky bounce in the 65th minute robbed England of a second and  potentially match-winning try.
With the tourists trailing 13-16, winger Adedayo Adebayo chased a cleverly  angled kick from fly half Stuart Barnes but lost the ball as it bounced  awkwardly over the line.

South Africa A: Tries: Scholtz (47), Stransky (64). Penalties: Stransky  (21, 59). Drop goals: Stransky (73).
