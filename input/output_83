WASHINGTON, May 12 (AFP) - Purchasing power of US households has been  rising and will continue to rise through the year 2000, the Conference Board  business research organization said Thursday.
Between 1960 and 1990, real per capita income doubled from 8,000 dollars  to 16,000 dollars a year, the board said.
"Frequent predictions of an emerging decline in US living standards have  little basis in fact," said Conference Board director Fabian Linden.
The survey found that a growing number of US households are joining the  middle class and that the 35-55 age group would soon control half the nation's  purchasing power.
The survey predicted that the number of households with an income level of  between 50,000 and 100,000 dollars annually will likely grow by one-third by  the end of the century and that the number of households earning more than  100,000 dollars would jump 80 percent.
Increased worker productivity, the greater participation of women in the  work force and increased levels of education were cited as factors for the  increase in purchasing power.
