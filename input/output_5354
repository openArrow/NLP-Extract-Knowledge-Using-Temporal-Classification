Burmese government troops fought Monday with the  Maung Tai Army (MTA) of opium warlord Khun Sa, holding week-old positions some  20 kilometers (12 miles) west of the border town of Tachilek, Thai border  authorities said.
Fighting in the government-guerrilla conflict remained sporadic and  intense in some areas, but there was no indication that either side was  gaining an advantage, they said.
The governor of Thailand's northern province of Chiang Rai, Pakdi  Rattanaphol, told reporters Monday in Mae Sai, directly across from Tachilek,  that the border crossing there would remain open.
The battle had not moved towards the border, he said, adding that there  had been no Burmese refugees fleeing from Tachilek into Thailand.
Western humanitarian sources contacted from Bangkok also said there had  been no influx of refugees across the Thai-Burmese border.
Last week, Thai border police reported that 200 men had crossed the  border, fleeing a search by Rangoon troops for local porters. But the men had  been sent back across to Tachilek the following day.
Meanwhile, Thai police on Monday said they had arrested a married couple  and another man in northern Thailand who were supplying weapons and heroin  refining chemicals to Khun Sa.
Police found 29.8 kilos (65 pounds) of heroin Sunday in the trunk of a car  in Chiang Mai province. A separate search yielded a large munitions cache,  including more than 70,000 rounds for US-made M16 and M60 assault rifles.
Khun Sa, who controls a majority of drug traffic within the so-called  "Golden Triangle," has denied running heroin-refining operations himself,  though it is widely believed he provides protection for factories run by Hong  Kong triads.
