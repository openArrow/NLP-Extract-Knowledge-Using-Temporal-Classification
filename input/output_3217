Nelson Mandela will make his first overseas trip  as South African president to Tunis next month for a OAU summit that should  formalize his country's membership in the international body, a government  official said Monday.
Foreign ministry director general Rusty Evans told reporters Mandela would  attend the summit of the Organization for African Unity from June 13 to 15.
It will be preceded by an OAU ministerial meeting on June 6-12 at which  South Africa will be represented by its new foreign minister, Alfred Nzo.
Mandela's first deputy president, Thabo Mbeki, will be in Addis Ababa  Wednesday to attend a ceremony at which the new South African flag will be  officially hoisted at OAU headquarters in the Ethiopian capital, he said.
Evans also said South Africa's return to the Commonwealth was "a foregone  conclusion" and that discussions were under way for the resumption of the  country's full membership at the United Nations.
One potential sticking point, he said, was the payment of South Africa's  arrears of more than 100 million dollars to the world body in dues unpaid  since the U.N. Credentials Committee rejected Pretoria's credentials in 1974.
But ministry officials said they believed the matter would be cleared up  by the next U.N. General Assembly session scheduled for September.
