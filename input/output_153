A chicken in western Iran has been laying eggs at  record speed, on average one egg almost every hour, its proud owner said  Friday.
Jalil Khorshidi from Kermanshah told IRNA news agency that the chicken, of  Chinese stock, produced 42 eggs in a 52-hour period, backed by a diet of rice,  wheat and vegetables. But it also eats twice as much as other hens.
