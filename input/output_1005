A condemned man who weighs more than  400 pounds (181 kilograms) is too heavy to be hanged without also losing his  head, his lawyer is arguing.
Mitchell Rupe, who is sentenced to die for the 1981 murders of two bank  tellers during a bank robbery, was likely to be decapitated if hanged, said  the lawyer, Todd Mayburn.
"Beheading was a punishment used in barbaric times," Maybrown said. "We  don't accept bodily mutilation as a form of punishment now."
Under Washington state law, Rupe has the choice of death by lethal  injection or by hanging. He already has rejected lethal injection as "morally  repugnant."
In court papers, the state argued that "a risk of decapitation, whether  slight or significant, does not render judicial hanging unconstitutonal."
A table in the state's hanging protocol says that to minimize the risk of  decapitation an inmate weighing 120 pounds (54.4 kilograms) should drop eight  feet, one inch (2.46 meters).
Inmates weighing 220 pounds (100 kilograms) or more should be dropped five  feet (1.5 meters).
