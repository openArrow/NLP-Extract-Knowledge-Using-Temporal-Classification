Japan's top seven nonferrous metal companies on  Monday reported a decline in their sales and pre-tax profits in the year to  March 31 due to sluggish demand at home and worldwide price debacles.
The stronger yen also eroded the competitiveness of their products abroad  and was expected to affect the companies in the current year during which they  mostly forecast slight improvements in earnings.
Nippon Mining and Metals Co. shifted into the red and Sumitomo Metal  Mining Co. saw its profit shrink nearly 100 percent as four of the seven  companies suffered declines in sales and earnings for the second straight year.
Mitsubishi Materials Corp. said its pre-tax profit dropped 73.7 percent  from the preceding year to 2.5 billion yen (23.8 million dollars) on sales  totaling 682.4 billion yen, down 8.2 percent.
Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. suffered a 96.0 percent drop in earnings to 300  million yen while its sales dipped 15.2 percent to 376.8 billion yen.
A 14.3 percent cut in its sales led Mitsui Mining and Smelting Co. to a  39.4 percent decrease in profits to 1.1 billion yen.
Nippon Mining and Metals Co. had a pre-tax loss of 2.5 billion yen on  sales of 192.3 billion yen. Nippon changed its accounting period to a full  year from five months for the year to March 31.
Dowa Mining Co. had a pre-tax profit of 2.3 billion yen, down 35.9  percent, with sales dropping 10.4 percent to 163 billion yen.
Earnings of Furukawa Co. dipped 49.4 percent to 3.4 billion yen as its  sales fell 10.8 percent to 126.4 billion yen.
Toho Zinc Co. suffered a 26.4 percent fall in its pre-tax profit to 1.1  billion yen and its sales went down 21.5 percent to 43.1 billion yen.
The seven firms predicted a slight improvement on the world non-ferrous  metal market and all but one of them forecast slightly better business in the  current year.
While Toho predicted declines in sales and earnings, Mitsubishi and Dowa  expected better sales and earnings. Nippon forecast its pre-tax loss would be  slashed to nil and the other three firms expected better earnings despite slow  sales.
