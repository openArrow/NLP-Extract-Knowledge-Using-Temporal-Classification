A huge black hole was discovered in a galaxy 50  million light years from Earth, the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA) announced Wednesday.
The hard evidence of the black hole in the giant elliptical galaxy M87  supports the existence of the collapsed stars which were predicted 80 years  ago by Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, a NASA statement said.
"If it's not a black hole, it must be something even harder to understand  with our present theories of astrophysics," said researcher Richard Harms.
The discovery came when the Hubble Telescope sent back images of a disk of  hot gas swirling around a central object that is extremely massive but  extraordinarily compact, characteristics of a black hole.
Until now black holes, objects so dense that nothing, not even light, can  escape their gravitational pull, have been considered mathmatical curiosities  rather than real astronomical objects.
"Now it all knits together," said astronomer Holland Ford. We see a  disk-like structure that appears to have spiral structure, and it's rotating."
NASA hopes to look even closer into the center of the disk and get an  accurate measurement of the black hole's mass.
