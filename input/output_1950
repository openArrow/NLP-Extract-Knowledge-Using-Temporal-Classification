British Telecommunications (BT) on Thursday  announced a 40 percent increase in annual pre-tax profits at 2.756 billion  pounds sterling (4.134 million dollars) from 1.97 billion pounds a year  earlier.
The result, for the year to March, was in line with analysts' expectations  of between 2.7 and 2.8 billion pounds.
The increase in profits was largely due to reduced redundancy charges  which slipped to 517 million pounds this year, compared with 1.034 billion  pounds the previous year.
The total number of people employed by the group was reduced by 14,700 in  the year to March, 1994, following a 39,800 reduction in staff the previous  year. BT anticipates reducing the 156,000-strong workforce by 15,000 this year.
Over the last four years, BT has reduced its workforce numbers by over 36  percent.
Sales rose 3.3 percent to 13.675 billion pounds from 13.242 billion pounds  in 1993.
Earnings per share rose to 28.5 pence from 19.8 the previous year, while  the dividend rose to 16.7 pence from 15.6 pence.
