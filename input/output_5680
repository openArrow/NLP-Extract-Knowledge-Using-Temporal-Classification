France's Mary Pierce continued her charge towards a  showdown with defending champion and world number-one Steffi Graf at the  French Open here on Tuesday when she destroyed Austrian Petra Ritter 6-0, 6-2  in just 57 minutes on the new Roland Garros 'A' show-court to reach the  semi-finals of the women's singles..
The 19-year-old Pierce has so far conceded only six games since the  Championships began nine days ago.
She now plays either Graf or Argentinian newcomer Ines Gorrochategui for a  place in next Saturday's final.
