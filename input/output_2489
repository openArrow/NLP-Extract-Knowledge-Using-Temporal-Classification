The number of leprosy cases worldwide is expected  to fall to an all-time record low of 2.4 million this year, 23 percent less  than in 1993, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said Friday.
The WHO said in a statement that it hoped to eradicate the illness by the  end of the century. Last year's 3.1 million cases showed considerable  improvement in preventing the disease when compared with the 5.5 million  figure of 1991.
The UN agency said the drop appeared to follow the introduction of  polychemotherapy in the 1980s in the main regions hit by the disease, India,  Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh and Indonesia.
