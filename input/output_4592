Hong Kong governor Chris Patten on Friday praised  the US decision to extend China's most favourite nation (MFN) trading status  despite a lack a progress on human rights abuse.
"We in Hong Kong are all delighted with this decision by the Clinton  admnistration", Patten told a press conference.
"We are concerned with human rights abuses but we have never believed the  solution is in limiting trade. Opening up markets is the best way of opening  up minds", he said.
Patten, who has been meeting here this week with Prime minister John Major  and other officials, said: "There has never been a good case for mixing  politics and economics, human rights and trade."
"I trust that the difficult but welcome decision that Mr. Clinton has  taken will underline the importance of pursuing goals along proper channels.
"It is not that human rights are not important," he said, "but entangling  them with trade does not make sense. That has been our position for years".
Patten said a decision by the Hong Kong legislative council on the  controversial creation of a Human Rights commission, before the colony reverts  to China in 1997, would be made in the following weeks.
