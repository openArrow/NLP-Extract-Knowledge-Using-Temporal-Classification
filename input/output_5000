The United States is determined to use  diplomacy to try to end North Korea's defiance of international nuclear  inspectors said the top US general Saturday.
"It is clearly our desire to resolve that issue without any kind of  confrontation," said General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs  of Staff.
"It is an issue of concentrating now on the appropriate next steps, which  is, through vigorous dialogue and diplomatic efforts, to reach a resolution,"  he said.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) revealed Friday that North  Korea has resumed refueling at a nuclear site, defying international  inspectors and threatening to make a full accounting of weapons-grade fuel  impossible.
IAEA director general Hans Blix said the accelerated pace of fuel rod  removal could, within days, make it impossible for inspectors to determine  whether weapons-grade plutonium had been diverted to military uses at the site  at Yongbyon.
Shalikashvili said the United States suspects plutonium had been diverted  in the past.
"We believe that there's a high likelihood that there was diversion some  time ago and that they could potentially have diverted enough fuel to have  built one or two nuclear devices," said Shalikashvili on CNN's "Newsmaker  Saturday" television program.
Although the US was determined to use diplomacy to end the crisis  Shalikashvili made clear that the military option was still avaiable.
"If North Korea were to miscalculate and take some military action, we,  together with our South Korean allies, are prepared to defend the Republic of  Korea," he said.
The UN Security Council is scheduled to meet Saturday to discuss the  possibility of a brief statement or resolution warning North Korea of the  seriousness of the situation and formally calling on Pyongyang to stop the  refueling, diplomats said.
