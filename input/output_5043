Dutch center Rik Smits and forward Dale Davis contained the Jamaican-born  Ewing and allowed New York just 29 points in the second half, their fewest  ever in one half of a playoff game.
"I'm not going to think much about it," Knicks' coach Pat Riley said.  "Patrick has a lot of pride and he will bounce back."
Indiana outscored the Knicks 25-13 in the third period to take command.  Ewing was called for his fourth foul 50 seconds into the period and spent the  remainder of it on the bench.
New York missed 9-of-12 shots and 7-of-14 free throw attempts in the  quarter. The Pacers led 62-52 entering the fourth quarter and pulled away  steadily.
Derrick McKey led Indiana with 15 points while Reggie Miller and Smits  added 14 and Haywoode Workman had 12.
Starks and Charles Oakley led the Knicks with 12. Starks sank his only  first-half basket, a 3-point shot, with 33 seconds remaining in the second  quarter, giving the Knicks a 39-37 half-time lead.
