Two major US pharmaceutical companies warned  Tuesday that President Bill Clinton's health care reform plan could blunt the  United States' competitive edge in research.
Price controls on drugs -- a key element to the plan currently debated in  Congress -- would sharply reduce the incentive for financing research,  according to Steven Carter with Bristol-Myers Squibb and Robert Armstrong with  Hoffman-La Roche Inc.
"If the climate is not conducive, there will be no breakthrough drugs,"  Hoffman.
Private pharmaceutical laboratories spent 12.6 billion dollars on research  and development in 1993 -- more than the US National Institutes of Health --  and discovered 92 percent of the drugs on the market, according to a US  pharmaceutical industry association.
The group also estimated that it can cost 359 million dollars to develop a  single drug which has a 1 in 5,000 chance of success and argued that the costs  and the huge risks involved justified free market pricing.
Under Clinton's health plan, drugs would be assigned a "reasonable" price  in the same way that insurance companies now set "reasonable and customary"  fees for doctors.
