A South African who led a white supremacist  organisation in his homeland will be allowed to stay in New Zealand as no  legal grounds existed to revoke his residence permit, Immigration Minister  Roger Maxwell said Friday.
Jan Smith was the head of the South African chapter of the Church of the  Creator and has written that the heritage of the white race is "threatened by  our deadly race enemies -- Jews, kaffirs and the mud races."
Last weekend, former anti-apartheid protesters marched on Smith's Auckland  home and tried to serve him with their version of a deportation order.
Maxwell ordered an inquiry into how Smith got here and said Friday that as  a result of that study there were no grounds for revoking Smith's permit.
Maxwell said he personally found the white supremacist statements that had  been attributed by the media to Smith to be abhorrent.
"If such statements were made in New Zealand they would likely fall foul  of the Human Rights Act," Maxwell said. "However, to my knowledge Jan Smith  has made no such public statements while in New Zealand."
"I would like to believe that we are tolerant enough to judge new  immigrants by their actions, not by their beliefs," he said.
He said that because of the degree of public concern about the issue he  had asked the Immigration Service to continue working on ways to strengthen  the character checks required under current residence policy.
"I make the point that this would not take the form of a subjective test  of the attitudes or beliefs of an immigrant. Such tests would be neither  practical nor desirable," he said.
"The likely elements in the character check would be based on past  observable actions. This would retain the objective integrity of the residence  policy and allow legal redress to revoke a residence permit if a false  declaration was made."
He said any additional character check would apply to all prospective  immigrants.
