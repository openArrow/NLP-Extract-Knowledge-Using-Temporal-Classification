Hong Kong's major domestic export items of  clothing, textiles, and consumer electrical and electronic products suffered  declines in the first quarter of the year, despite accounting for 52 percent  of the total domestic exports, official figures showed Monday.
Domestic exports of clothing and textiles fell five percent in the three  months to March from a year earlier to 8.2 billion Hong Kong dollars (1.05  billion US) and 7.9 billion dollars respectively, the Census and Statistics  Department said.
Consumer electrical and electronic products dropped by 20 percent to 6.9  billion dollars, it said.
For the first quarter of this year, exports of clothing, textiles and  consumer electrical and electronic products accounted for 52 percent of the  territory's total domestic exports of 44.74 billion dollars.
However, increases were recorded in the Janaury and March period in  machinery, parts and compenents, which rose four percent to 232 million  dollars.
Exports of non-metallic mineral products rose 98 percent to 103 million  dollars, food was up 11 percent at 54 million dollars.
Hong Kong's domestic exports have gradually declined as manufacturers  continue to shift production into China.
As a result, Hong Kong's exports have undergone structural shift from  domestic exports to re-exports, being China's main entrepot.
