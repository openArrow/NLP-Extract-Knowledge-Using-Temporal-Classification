Somerset captain Andy Hayhurst ground out a  six-hour century as his side crawled to 355 for nine on a rain-interrupted  second day of the English County Cricket Championship.
Hayhurst was unbeaten on 111 when he closed his side's innings and an  early tea was taken. He had batted for 384 minutes, hitting 10 fours and one  six.
When bad light brought a premature end to a cold and miserable day,  Warwickshire openers Dominic Ostler and Roger Twose had helped themselves to  57 runs off a depleted home attack.
The crowd had eagerly anticipated the skills of West Indian world  number-one batsman Brian Lara, but for the second successive day they were  frustrated as his only significant action was a straightforward slip catch.
Left-arm spinner Min Patel claimed three for five in 13 balls, to put Kent  in command against Lancashire at Canterbury.
The visitors finished on 171 for four in reply to Kent's daunting first  innings 556, the highest total in matches between the two counties.
Middlesex pace bowler Neil Williams scored 63 and then grabbed five  wickets, to leave Hampshire on the brink of a follow-on at Southampton.
Williams's highest score in three years, which included a six and six  fours, helped the visitors to 387.
He then wrecked Hampshire's frail batting order, missing England star  Robin Smith, with five for 49 off 20 overs.
Hampshire finished at 203 for nine, still 35 away from avoiding the  follow-on.
