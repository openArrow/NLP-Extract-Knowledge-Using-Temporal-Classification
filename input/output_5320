Thai police have arrested a married couple and  another man in northern Thailand who they say were supplying weapons and  heroin refining chemicals to Burmese opium warlord Khun Sa, a police official  said Monday.
Police found 29.8 kilograms (65 pounds) of heroin Sunday in the trunk of a  car belonging to a young Thai couple in Chiang Mai province, some 700  kilometers (435 miles) from here, he said.
A search of the pair's house yielded a large munitions cache, including  some 50,000 bullets for the US-made M16 assault rifle, 28,000 M60 rounds, and  an AK47 assault rifle.
Another Thai man was found on the premises, the official said.
All three have been charged with trafficking in and possessing heroin and  war weapons, he added.
The initial police investigation indicated Monday that the trio had been  supplying heroin-refining chemicals and weapons to Khun Sa and his Maung Tai  Army (MTA) in Burma's Shan State, the official said.
Chiang Mai shares a relatively un-policed border with Burma, as does Mae  Hong Son province, due west of Chiang Mai, where police said the bulk of  smuggled shipments were believed to have been made.
Khun Sa, who controls a majority of drug traffic within the so-called  "golden triangle" region, has denied running heroin refining operations  himself, though it is widely believed he provides protection for factories run  by Hong Kong triads.
