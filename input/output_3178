John Henry Weidner, a former Dutch army  captain who ran an underground network that saved more than 1,000 Jews and  Allied servicemen during World War II, has died. He was 81.
Weidner died Saturday of heart failure at his home in Monterrey Park, a  suburb of Los Angeles, his wife Naomi said.
Weidner was in Paris when Germany invaded the Netherlands in 1940. He was  detained in Lyons after trying to escape to England.
He then began organizing an underground network that smuggled Jews and  Allied servicemen out of Nazi-occupied France and Belgium to Spain and  Switzerland.
He was captured twice and tortured, but each time he managed to escape.  His sister Gabrielle, a member of the network, was killed by the Nazis.
"He always told me, had he been able to save just one person's life it  would have been worth all the trouble he went through," said Herbert Ford, who  chronicled Weidner's exploits in the 1966 biography "Flee the Captor."
After the war, he was decorated for heroism by the United States, Britain,  the Netherlands, France, Belgium and Israel.
Last year, the US Holocaust Memorial Museum honored him in Washington and  Atlantic Union College in Lancaster, Massachusetts founded the John Henry  Weidner Center for the Cultivation of Altruistic Spirit.
After the war, Weidner established a chain of health food stores in  California.
