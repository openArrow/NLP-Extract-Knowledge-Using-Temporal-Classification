The killing of a policeman playing the role of  a football hooligan during a practice run has reinforced fears that US  security forces might overreact if there is any trouble during the World Cup.
An investigation has been ordered in California where the policemen was  shot dead on a train by a fellow officer.
"I have great concern that domestic law enforcement is going to confuse  the passionate support of soccer fans with much publicized hooliganism," said  World Cup chief Alan Rothenberg.
"I fear police will take drastic action against people who are harmless  and that the media will report it as soccer violence.
"Undoubtedly there will be some fisticuffs, some arguments," he said. "I  hope to God police don't overreact and hope the media don't then make a big  deal about soccer violence."
Rothenberg said football's reputation in America was unfair.
"I guarantee there will be a lot less mayhem on the field than we've seen  in basketball and major league baseball recently," he said.
Although England's infamous fans will not be in America for the finals  which kick-off next month, West German and Dutch fans are expected in their  thousands.
Holland and Germany have a core of hardened hooligans who are amongst the  most violent in the world.
Rothenberg said the ultimate responsibility for public safety rested with  local authorities in the nine host cities.
Police at three venues have clashed with organizers over the fencing in of  pitches, although Rothenberg said he still hoped police in Washington and  Dallas could be persauaded from putting up fences.
Organizers also recommended restricting alcohol sales throughout venue  cities on game day as the Italians did in 1990.
However, the stringency of the measures depends on local officials.
"We are ready for whatever might occur," says Dave Jensen, head of the  Washington site.
