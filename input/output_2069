A 40-year-old man trying to light a cigarette  on a stove-top burner died of asphyxiation when he slipped and was knocked  unconscious, police said Thursday.
Police said the victim, Marc Geissweidt, apparently switched on the gas  burner but didn't get a chance to light it before his accidental fall  Wednesday at his home in a Strasbourg suburb.
The gas fumes suffocated him as he lay unconscious on the floor, they said.
