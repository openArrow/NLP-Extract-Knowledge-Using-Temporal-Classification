President Bill Clinton's wife Hillary may try  to succeed her husband in the White House, according to an article in the  latest edition of The New Yorker magazine.
But one person cited in the magazine article by Connie Bruck denied making  the remarks attributed to her and a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton said the  story "goes beyond imagination and is untrue."
The magazine quoted Betsey Wright, former chief of staff to Clinton when  he was governor of Arkansas, as saying, "There are a great many people talking  very seriously about her succeeding him.
"Their staff will say 'We have to do it this way and that way, and then  we'll be here at least 12 years,' And it's not just the staff. Friends,  Democrats, people out across the country think it is a very viable plan of  action," Wright said in December, according to the magazine.
Wright, now a Washington lobbyist, told a US news agency she never made  the comments, and said speculation about Mrs. Clinton succeeding her husband  was "silly."
The magazine said it stands by the story.
