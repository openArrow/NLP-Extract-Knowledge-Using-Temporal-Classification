Police and protestors clashed Sunday as some  5,000 ecologists demonstrated against plans to build a road tunnel under the  Pyrenees and boost traffic near one of the last sanctuaries of the native  European bear.
At least 10 demonstrators were injured as clashes broke out as police  tried to disperse 500 protestors who entered the tunnel building site where  workmen have burrowed 30 metres (100 feet) into the mountainside since the  project began in April, correspondents said.
Work is shortly due to start at the Spanish end of the 8.6-kilometre  (five-mile) tunnel under the Somport pass on the Franco-Spanish border.
Ecologists say the tunnel and extensions to the existing road will turn  the picturesque Aspe valley into a corridor for international lorry traffic.
They also fear the tunnel will open the way for construction of a motorway.
The ecologists have called for the reopening of a railway from Pau in  France to Canfranc in Spain which was closed down in 1970 as an alternative to  the road tunnel.
"We are not against progress.  We just oppose destruction. The tunnel is a  crime against this valley," said Marie-Anne Isler-Beguin, a leading Green  party candidate in next month's European elections.
