A depot stocking bombs for Russian Pacific fleet  warplanes blew up Saturday, shaking the far eastern city of Vladivostok some  100 kilometres away and triggering the evacuation of the nearest village.
ITAR-TASS news agency reported that the 3,000 residents of the village of  Novonedzhino were being evacuated. Several were hurt by broken glass and were  taken to hospital, but no deaths were reported.
Armored cars as well as a train were sent to the site to evacuate  residents from the military zone about 100 kilometres (60 miles) north of  Vladivostok in far-eastern Russia.
Military officers and their families also live at the base, but the number  of residents there was not known.
The news agency said that communications were currently impossible with  the base which was sealed off by police and the army.
According to the news agency Interfax, the explosions triggered fires in  the nearby forest.
Witnesses told ITAR-TASS that the blasts at 3:40 p.m. (0440 GMT) shook  Vladivostok.
The Russian emergency ministry said there were neither chemical nor  nuclear weapons at the depot.
Officials from the Pacific fleet, including Rear Admiral Igor Khmelnov,  the fleet's first deputy commander, and a counter-espionnage team were sent to  the site to determine the cause of the explosion.
A special team from the defense ministry left Moscow for the scene, the  emergency minstry said.
Exactly two years ago, a fire caused by negligence triggered a series of  explosions at a Pacific fleet weapons stockpile in a Vladivostok suburb.
Several people were killed and 6,000 residents were evacuated amid the  fires which raged for more than two days, destroying munitions depots and  fleet facilities.
