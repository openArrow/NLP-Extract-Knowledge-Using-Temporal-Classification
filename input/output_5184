Defending champion Sergi Bruguera kept his hopes of  retaining the French Open title alive here on Sunday when he outplayed  Australian Patrick Rafter 6-4, 6-3, 6-1 to reach the men's singles  quarter-finals.
The 26th-ranked Rafter, still learning his trade on his least-favourite  surface, was slowly worn down by the Spanish baseliner who will now face  fourth-seeded Andrei Medvedev of the Ukraine.
Medvedev, who was beaten by Bruguera in last year's semi-final, earlier  defeated Dutch opponent Jacco Eltingh 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1.
