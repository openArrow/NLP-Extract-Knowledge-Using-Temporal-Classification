A Briton was flogged 50 times for breaking Moslem  drinking laws in the Gulf State of Qatar, his father said Friday.
The British Foreign Office confirmed it was looking into the case, which  is thought to be the first time a Briton has been flogged in Qatar.
Computer technician Gavin Sherrard-Smith, 30, was lashed with three-foot  canes in the jail where he is serving a six-month sentence.
The beating took place on May 3, but Sherrard-Smith's father learned it  had taken place from a letter which arrived Friday.
In a post-script, his son wrote: "PS. Got my 50 on Tuesday. All okay. Glad  it's over."
Appeals for clemency by his 72-year-old father, former colonel Derek  Sherrard-Smith failed, despite further appeals from British diplomats.
Sherrard-Smith -- who denied selling alcohol to a Moslem -- was sentenced  to 50 lashes, six months in jail and deportation after his arrest in November.
Qatar allows westerners to drink only at home and strictly controls the  sale of alcohol.
