A strange first day of Indianapolis  500 time trials ended with a rookie on the front row, a woman in the second  and a top pole contender waiting to drive.
Al Unser Jnr won a provisional pole for the May 29 race in time trials  here Saturday, but reigning champion and practice speed leader Emerson  Fittipaldi can still topple his Penske teammate.
"I'm not really anxious or nervous, but I think it will be very difficult  to beat Al Jnr," Fittipaldi said. "The waiting game is tough, though. I hope  weather conditions are the same."
Canadian rookie Jacques Villeneuve qualified third. The son of late  Formula One driver Gilles Villeneuve could be the first front-row rookie at  Indy since Italy's Teo Fabi took the 1983 pole.
Lyn St. James, Indy's lone female driver, made a stunning fifth-place  showing, edging England's Nigel Mansell in the starting grid.
"I'm sure Nigel will get razzed, but he's got a good sense of humor," St.  James said.
A total of 21 drivers, seven of them rookies, qualified with an average  speed of 222.999 mph (356.798 km/h), but the rain-shortened session ended with  Fittipaldi last on a list of nine others waiting to take the 2.5-mile (4km)  oval. Each has one chance for the pole when qualifying continues Sunday.
"I don't mind having him go through that wait," said Unser, who has never  made a front-row start in 11 Indy races. He and Fittipaldi both use the  Mercedes engine that has dominated practice.
Unser, whose father won the pole here 24 years ago, improved with each lap  to reach a four-lap qualifying average of 228.011 mph (364.817 km/h). The  effort came despite hitting a bird on his first lap.
"I ran into it in turn one and it scared the heck out of me," Unser said.  "It shouldn't bother me. But I wanted to check out the car and make sure  everything was working all right."
