The Malaysian government Wednesday banned  rock concerts sponsored by US tobacco manufacturer RJ Reynolds, claiming that  they  promoted a culture that could lead to drug abuse among youths.
"The ban was decided by the cabinet based on police information that the  concerts promoted smoking, consumption of alcoholic drinks and free mixing  which is feared will lead to drug abuse," Information Minister Mohamed Rahmat  said.
"As far as drugs are concerned, we cannot regard the matter lightly. This  is not an allegation. This is a police report," Bernama news agency quoted  Mohamed as saying after the weekly cabinet meeting Wednesday.
Last week, the government banned TV stations from airing commercials of  the shows, popularly known as "Salem celebration concerts," following a  protest from an influential religious organisation, the Malaysian Moslem Youth  Movement (ABIM).
The government had also alleged that the concert promoters had distributed  free cigarettes and liquor to patrons, a charge denied on Tuesday by RJ  Reynolds, which manufactures the Winston, More and Salem brands of cigarettes.
"The sponsorship of the concerts is simply to bring the best in music to  the Malaysian public," Reynolds said in a statement.
The concerts had brought some of the world's most popular entertainers to  this predominantly-Moslem country. They included US singers Bob Dylan, Bobby  Brown and James Ingram, Hong Kong pop star Jackie Cheung and British raggae  group UB40 and pop group Duran Duran.
Some 70 shows, featuring local and overseas artistes, had been lined up in  more than 40 Malaysian towns this year, industry sources said.
