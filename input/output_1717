More than 100 more people landed in hospital  Wednesday with respiratory and heart trouble caused by a thick cloud of  pollution that has hovered over the Greek capital for three days running,  authorities said.
The government repeated urgent appeals for residents to leave their cars  home as levels of ozone and other toxic gasses remained well above danger  limits.
City emergency services said Wednesday that 154 people had been rushed to  hospital in the last 24 hours, with heart or breathing problems or overcome by  the combination of choking smog and heat.
The environment ministry said it would announce a new plan next week to  try to fight the cloud of pollution, which Greeks call the "nefos" and has  plagued the capital periodically for more than 10 years.
Previous governments have proposed various plans to help ease the problem  but so far to no avail.
