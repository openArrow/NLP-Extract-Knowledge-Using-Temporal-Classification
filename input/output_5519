The UN-controlled Tuzla airport was shelled  Monday as the UN reported Serb forces counter-attacking in north-central  Bosnia in a bid to halt a push westwards by the Moslem-dominated Bosnian army.
A spokesman for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) contacted by telephone  said the airport was hit twice by large calibre shells, though there were no  reports of casualties or damage.
After shelling stopped, the scale of alert at the airport was dropped from  red to yellow, UNPROFOR north-east sector spokesman Jens Kirk told AFP.
A Russian transport flight into the airport was cancelled "because the  Bosnian Serb forces said they had not been properly notified," Kirk said.
Although UNPROFOR did not say which side was responsible for the attack, a  military source told AFP: "The Serbs said Monday morning that they could not  guarantee safety at the airport today."
The airport had reopened on May 19. The last previous bombardment of the  airport came on May 17 when seven shells were fired from Serb positions as an  UNPROFOR aid plane was coming in to land.
Meanwhile, in a statement issued in Zagreb, UN special envoy Yasushi  Akashi condemned the "raising of military tension" in the area of the Posavina  corridor, a strip of Serb-controlled territory running across northern Bosnia.
Exchanges of fire at the end of last week appeared to have originated from  Serb-controlled areas south and southeast of the Orasje pocket, UNPROFOR said.
Bosnian Croat and Bosnian government forces then replied by shelling  Brcko, which was already the target of shelling between 10 and 23 May, the UN  statement added.
The targeting of civilian sectors is "a crime under international law and  must cease," Akashi warned.
Some 30 kilometres (20 miles) east of Tuzla, Serbs have launched a major  offensive, Colonel Ekrem Avdic, spokesman for the Bosnian army Second Corps,  said.
In the north-central region around Tesanj and Teslic, Serb forces are  trying to regain ground lost during a Bosnian army offensive south-west of  Tesanj, UNPROFOR's Sarajevo spokesman Major Rob Annink said.
Over the past week, the Bosnian army captured all the heights overlooking  the Serb-controlled town of Teslic, Annink said. The Serbs began "retaliating  with artillery on civilian areas" on Sunday, he added.
Annink said government commanders had concentrated troops in the region  over the past weeks in preparation for an offensive.
Their objective appeared to be to take over the Vlasic plateau which  dominates Travnik in order "to control the road to Donji Vakuf and probably  move downwards" to the south, he said.
Serb forces were also counter-attacking about 80 kilometres (50 miles)  south of the region, around Turbe and Travnik, Annink said.
General Rasim Delic, commander in chief of Bosnian armed forces, told a  local daily recently that he thought conditions were ripe for liberating seven  towns, including Teslic and Donji Vakuf.
In north-eastern Bosnia, the Serbs are "using artillery and tanks," with  the probable objective of cutting the road to Teocak, said Avdic, who was  speaking in Tuzla.
Teocak, a village devasted by the fighting, is at the extreme north of the  "Sapna finger," a sector controlled by the Bosnians which commands access to  the Posavina corridor.
Control of the Posavina corridor, barely three kilometres wide at its  narrowest point, allows the Serbs, via the town of Brcko, to link the  territories they have won in Croatia and northwestern Bosnia with their  conquests in eastern Bosnia right up to Serbia.
"The enemy is concentrating troops in the region of Posavina. We think  they are going to try something because they don't want a political  agreement," Avdic said.
Akashi last week called the Bosnian government and Serb sides to peace  talks Thursday and Friday in Geneva.
