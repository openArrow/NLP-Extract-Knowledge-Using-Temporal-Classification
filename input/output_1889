North Korea has begun removing spent fuel rods  from a reactor at the Yongbyon nuclear complex in defiance of international  warnings not to do so, The Washington Post said Thursday.
A three-member team from the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) found unspecified evidence that fuel withdrawal was under way,  the daily said quoting US and diplomatic sources.
"The defueling has started," a knowledgeable source told the daily  confirming North Korea's announcement Saturday that it had begun the procedure.
The United Nations and the United States had warned Pyongyang not to  remove the fuel rods before IAEA inspectors can check them to see if fissile  material has been diverted to make a nuclear weapon.
An IAEA spokesman in Vienna said Wednesday that the inspectors, who  arrived Tuesday in Pyongyang, had begun their week-long assignment but refused  to provide details.
Sources familiar with a preliminary report filed by the IAEA team told the  Post that defueling at the Yongbyon reactor 90 kilometers (54 miles) north of  Pyongyang was in its early stage, meaning that only a small portion of the  estimated 8,000 plutonium-laden fuel rods had been removed.
However, the report added, no efforts were made by North Korean engineers  to mark or segregate the spent fuel rods for eventual sampling by the IAEA  team.
The UN agency has said that without sampling it would be impossible to  determine whether plutonium has been diverted to a clandestine nuclear arms  program.
North Korea's continued refusal to abide by the IAEA's non-proliferation  rules has led to international threats of UN sanctions, which in turn prompted  war threats from Pyongyang.
US Defense Secretary, William Perry, said Wednesday that his government  faced "a very substantial near-term crisis" with North Korea.
