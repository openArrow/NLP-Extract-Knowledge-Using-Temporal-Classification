Andrea Montermini, in his first Grand  Prix meeting for Roland Ratzenberger who was killed at San Marino, crashed in  practice here Saturday for the Spanish Grand Prix.
He went out of control as he came out of the bend leading into the long  straight in front of the stands. His car slewed across the track and into the  sand-trap before hitting a low wall.
Marshalls pulled him out of his Simtek Fford but the extent of his  injuries was not believed to be serious. Medics lifted him into an ambulance  to take him to the circuit clinic when they could have used a helicopter which  was standing by to take him to hospital.
He was conscious and had tried to get out of the car himself, said a  marshall, who added the driver could move his legs.
The Italian, 30 today, was replacing Ratzenberger who was killed in  qualifying at the San Marino Grand Prix at Imola, Italy, four weeks ago.
Montermini was contracted for the Spanish and Canadian races, with French  driver Jean-Marc Gounon, 31, taking over for the French Grand Prix.
