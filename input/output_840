Sri Lankan cricket skipper Arjuna Ranatunga is to  face an inquiry into his refusal to go to last month's Sharjah tournament  following a fitness row.
Ranatunga, 30, is to be charged with misconduct at a Sri Lankan cricket  board executive committee meeting on May 30, officials said on Monday.
Ranatunga, spinner Muttiah Muralitharan, pace bowler Pramodya  Wickramasinghe and batsman Dulip Samaraweera pulled out of the six-nation  Australasia Cup tournament in protest after vice-captain Aravinda de Silva was  axed for failing a fitness test.
The board advised national selectors not to include Ranatunga in the pool  for Pakistan's tour in July until the inquiry is completed but the three other  rebels will not be punished.
The executive committee said Ranatunga failed to provide a satisfactory  explanation over his conduct as captain.
"The other three got away with a warning because each of them made a  qualified apology. But Ranatunga is sticking to his guns," an official who  attended the executive committee meeting said.
