Two goals by striker Daniele Massaro gave AC Milan  a 2-0 lead over Barcelona at half-time in the European Cup final here on  Wednesday.
The Italian champions, without their suspended central defenders Franco  Baresi and Alessandro Costacurta, were rewarded for taking the game to  Barcelona when Massaro put them ahead in the 22nd minute.
The Milan forward fired home from close range at the back post after  Montenegrin Dejan Savicevic had burst into the box on the right, waltzed round  Miguel Angel Nadal and flicked the ball across the Barcelona keeper Andoni  Zubizarreta.
Then right on the stroke of half-time, Massaro fired home again -- this  time with a left foot drive from just behind the penalty spot after Roberto  Donadoni's cutback from the by-line.
