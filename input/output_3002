Norway manager Egil Olsen lashed England and paid  tribute to his own team after their Wembley stalemate here on Sunday.
Olsen saw reasons for Norwegian World Cup optimism after the goalless draw  -- but argued new-look England failed to make the grade.
Olsen's men drew 1-1 in their last visit to Wembley during the World Cup  qualifiers and he said: "Our aim today was to be a better team than last time  and I think we succeeded.
"I think we created just as many goalscoring chances as England, so we are  quite satisfied."
He went on: "There are a lot of things we can do better, especially after  attacks break down. We are too slow in our approach and not accurate enough,  but we have much we can work with, especially on our set play."
Olsen, who criticised England before the match for trying to play a  continental-style close passing game, expressed disappointment with Terry  Venables team's performance.
He said: "They had chances in the first half but in the second half, I was  disappointed with them.
"I thought the tempo of the match would have been higher and I felt we  controlled it quite easily in the second half."
Venables admitted it was a "dour" game but far from downhearted.
But he criticised Danish referee Kim Neilsen for disallowing David Platt's  goal.
Venables said: "I was particularly disappointed because we didn't concede  a goal and waited for an opportunity. The free kick was an opportunity.
"The referee took the advantage away from us. We never asked for the ball  to be pulled back and the goalkeeper was ready.
"That was a disappointment because if you win a game 1-0 against  opposition like that it's a fine result."
