Eleven homes belonging to Gypsies were set on  fire by villagers in northern Romania following the murder of a 69-year-old  Romanian shepherd by two Gypsies, police said Tuesday.
They said the villagers torched the houses Sunday evening after the  victim, Toma Craciun, was buried. His two assailants allegedly killed him  after stealing about 60 of his sheep.
Police said the houses set on fire were completely destroyed but no one  was injured as Gypsies living in the village of Racsa had fled after the two  assailants were arrested.
Police said that the situation was calm in the village Tuesday and that  they had opened an enquiry to identify those responsible for the arson attack.
Last September two Gypsies were beaten and a third died in an arson attack  after a Romanian man was murdered in a village in central Romania. Some 30  homes belonging to Gypsies were set on fire at the time.
Several similar incidents have been reported throughout the country in the  last three years with tensions running high between the two communities.
Gypsies in Romania represent 1.8 percent of the population, or 400,000,  according to the last census carried out in 1992.
