Twelve countries announced Thursday plans  to contribute men or equipment to a new UN humanitarian mission in Rwanda,  said a UN spokesman said.
No firm offer or number of troops was released, however.
Canada said it would seriously examine supplying troops and equipment, but  France and Great Britain have spoken only about supplying equipment, said UN  spokesman Fred Eckhard.
Austrialia, Ghana, Senegal, Zimbabwe, the Netherlands, the Congo, Zambia,  Mali and Egypt are planning to send infantry soldiers, added Eckhard.
The United Nations is attempting to assemble 5,500 troops authorized by a  Security Counsel resolution Tuesday. The United States has voiced doubts about  the UN capacity to raise such a force rapidly.
Two members of the peacekeeping operations office left New York Wednesday  for Rwanda to evaluate the situation there, said Eckhard.
