Sudan's government and rebels reached agreement  here Tuesday on allowing relief convoys into the war-torn south of the country.
The accord is also expected to set the stage for a new round of political  talks this week on ending a more-than-decade-old war that has killed hundreds  of thousands of people and displaced millions of others.
The accord was signed by the Sudanese minister of state for social  planning, leaders of two factions of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA)  and a UN envoy.
The foreign ministers of Kenya, Ethiopia and Eritrea also witnessed the  signing.
The agreement is designed to facilitate an existing UN aid plan called  Operation Lifeline Sudan.
Final approval of the document had hung in the balance after John Garang's  SPLA delegation failed to show up for a signing ceremony on Monday and again  on Tuesday when last-minute disputes arose between the government and the two  factions, causing a delay of six hours.
The SPLA took up arms in 1983 in a bid to end domination of mainly  Christian and animist southern Sudan by the Arabised Moslem north.
Previous peace initiatives by African countries and other international  efforts have failed to end the war.
A major government offensive launched at the end of last year seems to  have got bogged down. Diplomats had said it was intended as a final push to  crush the southern rebellion.
Fighting has continued despite the onset of the rainly season which turns  much of the vast, undeveloped south into swamp and marsh, diplomats said.
