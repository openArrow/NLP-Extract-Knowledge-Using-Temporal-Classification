Japan's biggest condom maker Okamoto Industries Inc.  said Friday its pre-tax earnings dropped 13.1 percent from a year earlier to  3.5 billion yen (34 million dollars) in the year to March.
The company said sales declined 15.4 percent to 72.5 billion yen in the  same period, depressed by lower revenue from virtually all sectors, especially  its tyre business and its clothing and footwear activities.
Okamoto said profits and sales were expected to stagnate at around the  same levels in the current year.
"We cannot expect a rapid recovery in private sector capital investment  and personal consumption. The business environment surrounding our company is  expected to remain severe," a statement said.
Okamoto, which operates a joint venture with French tyremaker Michelin,  said tyre sales plunged 27 percent during the year to 14.7 billion yen. Sales  of clothing and footwear sagged 20.1 percent to 17.3 billion yen, and sales of  building and industrial materials fell 7.7 percent to 19.1 billion yen.
Sales of medical and sundry goods dropped 1.1 percent to 10.3 billion yen,  and sales of vinyl were down 5.1 percent at 8.1 billion, the company said.
Sales of sportswear rose 0.9 percent to three billion yen.
