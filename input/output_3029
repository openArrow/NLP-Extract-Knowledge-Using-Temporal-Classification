Iraq late Sunday expressed strong support for the  Sanaa government of President Ali Abdallah Saleh, denouncing what it called  south Yemen's "heinous" declaration of independence.
In a statement received here cited by the official Iraqi INA agency,  Foreign Minister Mohammad al-Sahhaf said: "Iraq supports Yemen's legal and  consitutional authorities" under Saleh.
Baghdad "strongly condemns the heinous act of secession carried out by  (southern strongman) Ali Salem al-Baid and his group," the statement added.
The statement was the most unequivocal yet in Sanaa's favour by an Arab  gouvernement since Al-Baid declared an independent southern Yemen Democratic  Republic overnight Friday.
Meanwhile in Rabat Moroccan King Hassan II urged Sunday the war-torn  country's leaders to preserve a unified Yemen at what was a "crucial moment"  in its history, officials said.
The call came in a message of congratulation to Saleh to mark the fourth  anniversary Sunday of the country's unification.
In the early days of the civil war which broke out May 5, Aden-based  southern leaders charged that Iraqi pilots had been drafted into the northern  air force.
Saleh had adopted a favourable stance towards Baghdad during the 1991 Gulf  War.
