Russian orthodox church Patriarch Aleksy II  arrived from Moscow on Saturday with a delegation of church officials for a  five-day official visit to the former Yugoslavia.
"I hope to meet all parties to the conflict in this region and wish to see  a quick end to the blood-letting and suffering of innocent people," he said on  landing.
The patriarch, invited by the Serbian Orthodox church, said earlier in  Moscow that the visit was "a peace mission aimed at ending the bloodbath."
The Russian delegation will visit Serbia, Montenegro and  Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Meetings are scheduled with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and the  president of the rump Yugoslav republic, Zoran Lilic, but none with Bosnian or  Croat leaders figure on the delegation's official programme.
Russia has been a traditional ally of the Serbs, who are fellow Slavs and  orthodox Christians.
