Russia launched a cargo rocket Saturday from the  Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan to resupply three cosmonauts who have been  aboard the space station Mir for more than four months, ITAR-TASS reported.
The agency, quoting Russia's space centre, said the rocket lifted off at  7:30 a.m. (0330 GMT) with 2.2 tonnes of equipment and food aboard.
It is due to dock at the space station on Tuesday.
Aboard Mir are Viktor Afanasiev, who is the commander, Yuri Usachev and  Valery Poliakov.
They have been there since January 8.
Afanasiev and Usachev are to remain for a total of six months, but  Poliakov is due to stay aboard the station for 14 months and thus break the  366-day endurance record set by cosmonaut Musa Manarov.
