The Yemeni parliament on Sunday rejected outside  interference in the country's civil war, the official news agency Saba  reported.
Interference by any state, regional or international organisation would be  in violation of the constitution, MPs said in a statement, without direct  reference to UN Security Council efforts to install a ceasefire.
Such action was dangerous and could open the door for any small group to  be recognised internationally, parliament said.
But in Cairo, Yemen's northern foreign minister, Mohammad Bassandawa,  agreed Sunday to the Security Council efforts after meeting President Hosni  Mubarak, according to his Egyptian counterpart Amr Mussa.
"Sanaa has agreed that the question of a ceasefire be examined by the  United Nations Security Council," in contrast to its previous stand that the  war was an internal matter and the international community should stay out,  Mussa said.
Bassandawa himself said the Council "must insist on preserving Yemen's  unity."
"We want an end to the fighting as well as a Security Council decision in  this direction," the foreign minister said. "Then a dialogue could be launched  between the two parties."
Planning Minister Abdelkarim al-Iryani told parliament that it would only  be possible to stop the war if southern leader Ali Salem al-Baid recognised  the legitimate government and if his soldiers joined the army of unity.
It was impossible to hold talks with Baid and followers unless they  renounced their declaration of a separate state.
Parliament decided to expel six MPs, all Baid supporters in the Yemen  Socialist Party. They could now be arrested and put on trial, but Saba did not  specify what charges would be raised.
