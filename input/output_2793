Northern Yemeni leaders denounced the southern  declaration of independence as treason late Saturday and hinted they could  break off links with countries dealing with the new republic.
Three senior government figures said the south's secession four years  after former North and South Yemen were unified in May 1990 was "an act of  high treason which had to be punished," in a statement quoted by the agency  SABA.
Vice President Ali Salem al-Baid has declared the south an independent  Yemeni Democracti Republic (YDR) with the port city of Aden as its capital.
His move provoked the anger of his northern rival President Ali Abdallah  Saleh who cancelled an earlier ceasefire and vowed to crush the state's  independence bid.
In the northern capital Sanaa, an official communique said the "secession  violates the constitution of the (unified) Yemeni republic and deviates from  the people's will which declared itself in favour of unity in the referendum  on May 5 1991.
"All contact with the traitor Ali Salem al-Baid will be considered an act  hostile to the Yemeni people and a flagrant and unacceptable interference in  our internal affairs," the statement added.
"We reserve the right to reply in an appropriate manner," the statement  said, alluding to a possible break in diplomatic relations.
Meanwhile, Saleh spoke by telephone with five Arab leaders including King  Fahd of Saudi Arabia and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, SABA said.
He also informed PLO leader Yasser Arafat, Algerian President Lamiane  Zeroual and United Arab Emirates leader Sheikh Zayed ben Sultan Nahyan of the  current situation in Yemen, denouncing Baid for his "crime" of declaring  independence.
And a northern military spokesman said here that a southern plane had been  shot down over Abyan, east of the southern stronghold Aden, and 15 tanks and  other military equipment had been seized.
