TOKYO, May 14 (AFP) - IBM Japan Ltd. is to more than double its  recruitment in 1995 because it is expecting a recovery following brisk sales  of semiconductors and computers, news reports said Saturday.
The Japanese subsidiary of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) is  to hire about 300 university graduates next year, compared with 140 this year,  the Yomiuri newspaper said.
It is the first time in six years that the company is to boost the number  of new employees.
The newspaper said the gain was based on expectations that the company,  which suffered losses last year, planned to reap profits this year on brisk  shipments of semiconductors.
The Yomiuri also said the larger recruitment was aimed at preparing for  growing markets of multimedia-related businesses in the near future.
The company, facing severe business conditions in Japan, has restructured  and shed 3,000 employees last year.
Japan's Fujitsu Ltd. also plans to boost recruitment next year from 300  new graduates last year to 400 next year, the Yomiuri said.
The Japanese computer maker, which suffered its first ever loss last year,  also expects profits for the current year on growing demand for semiconductors  and workstations.
