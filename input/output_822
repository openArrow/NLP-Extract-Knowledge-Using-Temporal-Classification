China and Britain are set to launch rival  campaigns to win international acceptance of their Hong Kong passports.
Preparations for China's Special Administrative Region (SAR) document are  to be discussed in Beijing this week. China is expected to stage a world-wide  promotion campaign for visa-free acceptance of its passport designed for  travel by Hong Kong residents after 1997 return to mainland rule.
Hong Kong press reports said Monday, the Chinese authorities have already  decided to turn down British requests for help to get its British National  Overseas (BNO) document recognised.
A two-day meeting of the Preliminary Working Committee, China's so-called  shadow policy making body for the territory, is to see samples of the new SAR  document, the Ta Kung Pao newspaper said.
The Beijing run newspaper added that promotion of the document will be  launched as early as possible to secure a visa-free deal for holders.
Rita Fan, a former Hong Kong legislator who is head of the PWC law and  order sub-group, told reporters on Sunday that preparations for the passports  could be made before 1997, but stressed the document would only become valid  after formal endorsement by the SAR government.
Chinese sources said Beijing expected the SAR passports to be more  acceptable than BNO passports to Hong Kong residents after 1997, since the BNO  documents do not allow right of residence in Britain.
Around 3.5 million of Hong Kong's six million population have BNO  passports.
The key to the battle for influence will be to get other countries to  agree visa-free arrangements.
