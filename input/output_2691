Joint Israeli and Palestinian  patrols began operating Saturday in the newly-autonomous Gaza Strip, the head  of the Palestinian police force Nasr Yussef said.
Nine began to patrol in the Strip and two were operating in the self-rule  enclave of Jericho on the West Bank, a Palestinian police source said.
The first joint patrol in Gaza between Israeli troops and Palestinian  police started late Friday close to where two Israeli soldiers were shot dead  earlier in the day by Islamic militants.
The soldiers were gunned down earlier Friday on the northern edge of Gaza  when three men in a car raked a roadblock with automatic weapons fire in a  dawn attack. They fled into the autonomous Palestinian zone.
They were the first Jewish soldiers killed since Israel and the PLO signed  an accord on May 4 to launch self-rule in Gaza and Jericho.
Islamic Jihad said it carried out the "heroic" operation which left the  two soldiers dead near the Erez border crossing, controlled by Israel.
PLO chief negotiator Nabil Shaath held talks with Deputy Chief-of-Staff  General Amnon Shahak after the attack to discuss security questions,  Palestinian and Israeli sources said.
Each patrol is made up of a Palestinian jeep carrying four armed policemen  and an Israeli military jeep.
Yussef meanwhile accompanied by a large number of officers visited the  Gaza mosque on Saturday for the Moslem feast of Al-Adha, before going to a  cemetry to pay his repects to the victims of Israeli represssion, witnesses  said.
A delegation of policemen also visited the grave of a colleague killed  Thursday in a car accident.
