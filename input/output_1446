American composer-arranger Quincy Jones and  Austrian baroque conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt were on Tuesday awarded the  1994 Polar Music Prize by Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf.
Each received a cheque worth one million Swedish kronor (128,205 dollars),  the largest money prize awarded in the music industry.
Jones said he would donate his prize money to the African National  Congress in South Africa.
"It feels right considering all that Sweden has done over the years to  combat racial oppression in South Africa," Jones said.
The Polar Music Prize was founded by the Swedish record company magnate  Stikkan Anderson, who in 1989 donated 42 million kronor (5.4 million dollars)  in prize money to the Royal Swedish Academy of Music, which selects the  prizewinners.
Anderson originally wanted the Polar prize to be a Nobel Prize for Music,  but was turned down by the Nobel Foundation and its chairman Stig Ramel.
According to Anderson, who is chairman of the prize committee, the  original 42 million kronor (5.4 million dollars) are now worth some 60 million  kronor (7.7 million dollars).
The prize was first awarded in 1992, to Paul McCartney and the three  Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. In 1993 the award was given to  Dizzy Gillespie post-humously and to composer Witold Lutoslawski.
