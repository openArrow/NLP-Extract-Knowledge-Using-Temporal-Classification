Russian envoy Victor Possovaluk called here Saturday  for a total Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights in exchange for full  peace with Syria.
Possovaluk, who earlier in the week met Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq  al-Shara in Damascus, said he felt "Syria is anxious to make real progress in  its peace talks with Israel."
The special Middle East envoy of Russian President Boris Yeltsin also  stressed Jordan's role in relaunching peace talks, whether on "a bilateral or  multilateral level."
He told reporters after meeting Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel Salam  Majali they had discussed ways of boosting the peace process.
Majali meanwhile announced that Jordan, Israel and the Palestinians would  soon hold three-way talks on economic issues.
Israel has annexed the strategic heights since seizing them in the Middle  East war in 1967. The issue has remained the main stumbling-block to resuming  direct peace talks between Syria and the Jewish state.
Syria is demanding a prior Israeli commitment to withdrawal totally from  the Golan, while Israel has demanded a peace pledge from Syria first.
