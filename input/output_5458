A German member of the European Parliament was  charged Monday with dealing in forged banknotes to the value of some five  million Swiss francs (3.55 million dollars), police and prosecutors said.
Dieter Schinzel, a Euro-MP of the Social Democrat Party (SPD), was  arrested Friday in Aschaffenburg, southern Germany, along with four men from  the former Yugoslavia and two German women, the joint statement said.
The accused, who had offered the counterfeit money for sale, were arrested  in a hotel in a major operation by police from a number of districts after  arriving in Aschaffenburg in several cars.
The money was found wrapped in plastic sachets in the trunk of one car,  and a firearm was found in another, the statement said.
Of the seven people arrested Friday, one of the German women, identified  as Schinzel's driver, was freed while the other six were remanded in custody.
The Euro-MP, who heads the SPD in the west German city of Aachen, was  asked  by his local party to resign from all elected and party political posts  pending prosecution of the case.
Being caught apparently red-handed he could not claim parliamentary  immunity, a prosecution source explained.
Schinzel, a Euro-MP since 1979, is not standing again in the elections to  the European Parliament that take place June 12.
From 1991 to 1993 he was chairman of the German-Arabian Society, and he  had helped secure the release of German hostages held in Iraq.
