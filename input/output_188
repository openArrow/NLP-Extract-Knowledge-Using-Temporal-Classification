The latest agreement between Russia and Ukraine on  sharing out the Black Sea fleet will fail, fleet commander Eduard Baltin said  Friday, warning of power cuts to some Ukrainian navy units.
The Russian admiral made the gloomy forecast to the Interfax news agency.  He said the Russian part of the naval command was getting ready to cut off  electricity to some Ukrainian navy units in the Crimea, because the Ukrainians  owed the fleet 4.5 billion rubles (2.5 million dollars).
It was not a political decision, since "one must not mix politics and  economic matters," he said.
Last month Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk concluded a new  agreement in principle on dividing the fleet, an issue which has bedevilled  bilateral relations since the collapse of the Soviet Union. But the two sides  have failed since then to agree on practical measures.
"The April agreement will fail like all the previous ones," Baltin told  Interfax. He reiterated Russian opposition to letting Ukraine keep bases at  Sevastopol the fleet headquarters, saying it was "against all common sense and  has already aggravated tensions".
The port is in Crimea, which belongs to Ukraine but has a Russian majority  population.
