Several dozen hardline settlers would pray at  the ancient Jewish synagogue in Jericho on Sunday under the protection of the  new Palestinian police, far-right Israeli MP Hanan Porat said.
"Jewish believers will go to the synagogue in coordination with the  Israeli army," said Porat of the National Religious Party.
The army now patrols the area jointly with the Palestinians.
"We do not want any provocation or clashes with the Palestinian police,"  he said.
"But we consider it shameful that Israel has signed an agreement which  puts Palestinians in charge of a Jewish holy place. It's a dangerous  precedent," Porat told state radio.
The group intended to cross into the newly-autonomous enclave from the  north by the Jewish settlement of Naama.
"No one can dictate to us the internal rules in a synagogue," Porat said.  "We will pray and study the Torah (Jewish law) on site all day," he added.
A joint Palestinian-Israeli patrol stopped extremists from the banned  racist Kach movement from praying in the synagogue overnight Friday, Israeli  military sources said.
The Kach members tried to slip into the Shalom al Israel (Peace upon  Israel) synagogue under cover of darkness.
But the patrol, which included Palestinian police who only took up their  new duties on Friday, rumbled the ploy.
The group obeyed the patrol's orders to leave.
Kach was banned by Israel after the February 25 Hebron mosque massacre in  which a Jewish settler killed 30 Arab worshippers.
It was the second time that Israelis had tried to get into the synagogue  since the army withdrew from the West Bank town of Jericho on Friday  transferring powers to the Palestinians.
Jewish settlers from Ofra, north of the town, have also tried to enter.
Under the Israel-PLO self-rule deal signed on May 4 in Cairo, the  synagogue is to be administered by the Palestinians in coordination with the  Israeli ministry for religious affairs.
