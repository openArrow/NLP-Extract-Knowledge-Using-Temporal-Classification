Gypsy band violinist Sandor Lakatos, who reached  world fame through popularizing Hungarian gypsy music, died at age 69 after a  long illness, his family said Tuesday.
Lakatos was the first Hungarian musician to be at the center of an  exhibition at the London Museum of Music in 1988.
As early as 1952, he won a world recording competition in Paris heading  the gypsy orchestra of the state Hungarian Radio, and had great success at the  1958 Brussels World Fair.
He received Hungary's top Ferenc Liszt musical award and was granted the  "Master of Folk Art" title in 1954.
He headed various gypsy bands in leading restaurants and hotels of the  Hungarian capital and sold more than half a million LP's featuring gypsy music.
