Colin McRae could face an  international ban after his run-in with Greek officials here led to him being  thrown out of the Acropolis Rally.
The Automobile and Touring Club of Greece's Board of Stewards has reported  the Scot to the Royal Automobile Club and the International Automobile  Federation for unsporting conduct.
McRae, who had lost the lead to Subaru teammate Carlos Sainz, deliberately  blocked the road for 20 minutes to replace a windscreen he claimed had been  smashed by negligent officials.
He said the scrutineers failed to fasten down the bonnet after sampling  petrol at a time check and it later blew open and smashed the windscreen.
The organisers claimed McRrae had enough time to change the windscreen as  they would have allowed him to start the 23rd special stage six minutes after  the last car.
McRae turned down the offer and blocked the road while he carried out the  repairs with his navigator Derek Ringer.
McRae said before the decision: "To be penalised, when it was not my  fault, would be a shame. I hope the officials will decide in my favour."
However, neither McRae nor his team manager Andy Moss attended the Board  of Stewards' meeting.
Only Ringer and Subaru team chief David Richards went to the meeting.
It was the first time a driver had been excluded in these circumstance.
World champion Juha Kankkunen of Finland, who delayed the start of a stage  for 40 minutes during the 1993 RAC Rally of Britain in protest over a route  change, went unpunished.
