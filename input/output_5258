Just when the rain-disrupted Colonial  golf tournament was back on track, thunderstorms stopped play Sunday leaving  Scott Simpson with a one-shot lead with seven holes to play.
Simpson and his pursuers, notably Nick Price and Hale Irwin, will return  with 15 other players to complete the final round on Monday, the Memorial Day  holiday in the United States.
Simpson, who set a three-round scoring record to start the day with a  four-shot lead, was 14-under through 11 holes Sunday.
Price, with five holes left to play, was 13-under and Price, the 1993 US  PGA player of the year, was 12-under with five to go.
The only blip on Simpson's steady round was a bogey at the fourth Sunday.
Irwin and Price, both seven adrift at the start of play, made up ground  like gangbusters.
Irwin birdied four in a row from the sixth and picked up another stroke at  11.
Price strung together three birdies from the 11th just before play was  halted.
