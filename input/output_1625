The Siemens engineering group and a  Chinese company have agreed to set up a joint venture to produce low-voltage  switch gear in China, Siemens said on Wednesday.
A subsidiary of Siemens, ASI which specialises in switch gear, and the  Beijing Machine Tool Switchgear Works, would invest 40 million marks (24  million dollars) in the company which would employ 600 people within five  years, the company said.
The German company would hold a majority stake in the new company which  would be called Siemens Electrical Apparatus Beijing Ltd.
It was the second such contract between Siemens and Chinese interests  within seven weeks, the statement said.
Meanwhile Siemens president Heinrich von Pierer told the Die Woche weekly,  which comes out on Thursday, that German industry was welcome as a partner in  the Asia-Pacific region because it offered an alternative to Japan.
