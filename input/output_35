A former Italian health minister nicknamed  Torquemada for his inquisitorial raids on hospitals to unmask fraud was  arrested on corruption charges Thursday, judicial sources said in Naples.
The arrest of Francesco De Lorenzo of the Liberal Party comes after an  investigation into bribes paid by pharmaceutical laboratories to a ministry  official, to win government backing for higher prices.
The former minister, charged on 67 counts, is accused of receiving seven  billion lira (4.5 million dollars) in bribes between 1990 and 1992.
The charges also cover his relations with advertising companies which  carried out AIDS public awareness campaigns.
De Lorenzo, 56, is an eminent doctor and popular television personality  whose family is descended from the Neopolitan aristocracy.
He made his mark by campaigning against hospital fraud, earning the  nickname Torquemada after descending on wards to unmask corruption.
But he was forced to resign in February 1993 after his 89-year-old father  was arrested for receiving commission on the sale of a building.
