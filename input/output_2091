Rosemary West, 40, wife of accused  serial killer Frederick West, was Thursday charged with a seventh murder in  connection with the so-called "House of Horrors."
The latest charge accused her in the death of Shirley Ann Robinson, 18,  whose remains police said they found buried in the rear garden of the Wests'  house at 25 Cromwell Street in this town in western England.
Robinson, once a boarder at the house, was in late pregnancy when she  died, officials said.
Rosemary West, mother of eight, is now charged with seven murders jointly  with her husband, a 52-year-old stone mason who is charged with a total of 11  murders, including those of his first wife and two of his daughters.
In addition, Rosemary west is charged with a variety of sexual offenses  against children.
Nine of the 11 bodies were unearthed from the garden, basement, walls and  floors of the house.
Another was found in a house nearby, once occupied by Frederick West, and  another was dug up from a cornfield near his boyhood home.
Police said they were probing other areas where West previously lived, and  sources said the body count could eventually top 20.
