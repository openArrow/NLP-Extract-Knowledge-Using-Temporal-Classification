Death and destruction such as  events in the former Yugoslavia have wrought could be overcome with unity  among Muslim, Western and post-communist nations, the Aga Khan said Friday.
The Aga Khan, leader the world's 25 million Ismaili Muslims, said Western  science and democracy, Muslim values and the communist emphasis on social  welfare should be fused to prevent such conflicts.
He made particular mention of the conditions in the Asian republic of  Tajikistan, a flash point for all three cultures.
When the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991, factional fighting broke in a  power struggle in Tajikistan.
"It is here that those three cultures could forge a success that would  contrast starkly with the brutal failure in Bosnia," he said.
The leader made his comments before 1,820 graduates and guests at the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
