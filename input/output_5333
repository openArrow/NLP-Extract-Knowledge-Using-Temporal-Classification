Two small emirates have settled a long-standing  but quiet border dispute after mediation by the president of the United Arab  Emirates (UAE), Sheikh Zayed ibn Sultan al-Nahayan, the UAE announced Monday.
Ras al-Khaimah and Umm al-Quwain, both members of the UAE, signed a border  demarcation agreement on Sunday, according to a statement appearing in local  newspapers.
The rulers Sheikh Saqr ibn Mohammad al-Qassimi of Ras al-Khaimah and    Sheikh Humaid ibn Rashid al-Mualla of Umm al-Quwain signed the agreement in  response to "mediation efforts by President Sheikh Zayed ibn Sultan     al-Nahayan and Vice President and Prime Minister Sheikh Maktum ibn Rashid  al-Maktum," the statement said.
It did not elaborate on the dispute but diplomats said it has been     dormant for several years and has never blown up into conflict.
"It was a minor dispute which has not had any major impact on relations  between the two emirates and their rulers," one diplomat said.
Ras al-Khaimah and Umm al-Quwain have a combined area of around 3,000     square kilometres (1,200 square miles), a fraction of the UAE's total area of  around 80,000 square kilometres (32,000 square miles).
The two emirates have little oil and their Gross Dometic Product stood at  4.8 billion dirhams (1.3 billion dollars) in 1993 compared with the UAE's     GDP of 131 billion dirhams (35.6 billion dollars).
Ras al-Khaimah, overlooking the strategic Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf,  claims the Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb islands, now controlled by Iran.  Another disputed island with Iran, Abu Musa, is claimed by the UAE emirate     of Sharjah.
The UAE is a federation of seven sheikhdoms established just after they  gained independence from Britain in December 1971. The four other emirates are  Abu Dhabi, ruled by Sheikh Zayed, Dubai, ruled by Sheikh Maktoum, Ajman and  Fujeirah.
