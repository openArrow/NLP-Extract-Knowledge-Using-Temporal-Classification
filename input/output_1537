The dollar fell in Tokyo to close Wednesday at  104.18 yen, down 0.52 yen from the previous day's finish of 104.70 yen,  despite a US interest rate hike overnight.
The central Bank of Japan was seen buying the US unit in the lower 104 yen  level as dollar selling in Tokyo was led by Japanese exporters, dealers said.
The yen's advance against the mark also helped push down the dollar, they  said.
After opening at 104.41 yen, down from New York's late Tuesday quote of  104.55 yen, the spot dollar moved narrowly between 104.15 yen and 104.50 yen.  Spot turnover totaled 5.877 billion dollars against 3.451 billion dollars  traded in the previous session.
The mark closed at 1.6741 to the dollar, compared with the previous day's  1.6727.
