The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)  has asked the Israeli government for permission to visit Mustafa Dirani, a  Moslem Lebanese leader kidnapped by Israeli commandos over the weekend, the  ICRC said Monday.
It said that if its request was rejected it would publicly remind Israel  that it is a signatory to the Geneva convention on human rights.
Israel has in the past rejected ICRC requests to visit certain prisoners.
Dirani, head of the pro-Iranian "Resistance of the Faithful," was snatched  from his home by Israeli commandos in a daring airborne raid in Lebanon on  Saturday.
The Israeli government said he was kidnapped solely to obtain information  on the fate of Ron Arad, a missing Israeli airman captured in Lebanon in 1986  and believed to be still alive.
