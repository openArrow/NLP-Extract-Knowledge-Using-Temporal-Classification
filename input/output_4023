The Test and County Cricket Board was at the centre  of a fierce protest on Wednesday as Kent were eliminated from the Benson and  Hedges Cup in an indoor 'stump shoot-out'.
Kent have lodged a complaint with the TCCB over the two-day wash-out of  their quarter-final with Warwickshire at Birmingham.
Kent's anger and frustration is directed chiefly at the inability to play  yesterday, when there was little rain.
The famous Edgbaston "Brumbrella" cover had not been used the previous  three days to protect the square because of a fungus problem.
Kent coach Daryl Foster said: "We have expressed our disappointment to the  TCCB at finding a Test ground, with supposedly the best cover in the world,  with a wet pitch and surroundings."
Spinner Nigel Llong missed with the final two balls of the shoot-out to  put Warwickshire through 5-4.
Kent paceman Alan Igglesden summed up his side's frustration when he said:  "We came here to play a game of cricket and effectively lost at skittles."
Kent had the sympathy of Warwickshire skipper Dermot Reeve, who said: "I  would have preferred for a proper 55-over game to have been rescheduled for  sometime next week."
At Trent Bridge David Ward blasted Surrey into the semi-finals with a  whirlwind innings of 73 against Nottinghamshire.
Opener Darren Bicknell laid solid foundations by compiling an unflustered  century, and Alistair Brown finished it off in champagne style.
But it was Ward's big hitting that made a mockery of Notts' seemingly  testing total of 275 for eight.
The 33-year-old batsman crashed six sixes and three fours during a 57-ball  stay, that set up a ridiculously easy six-wicket victory.
