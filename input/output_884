Northern Ireland police swooped on Protestant  loyalist hideouts in west and north Belfast early Monday, making a large but  unspecified number of arrests, sources said.
A police spokesman said the operation was continuing and would not comment:
An informed source said those held for questioning included a leader of  the Ulster Freedom Fighters, a main loyalist militia.
Protestant paramilitary groups have for some two years been held  responsible for more killings that the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in Ulster  and police say they the greatest current threat to security in the province.
