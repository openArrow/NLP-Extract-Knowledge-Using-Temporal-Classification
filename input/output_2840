Police were Sunday questioning a 50-year-old man  and several other people in connection with the murders of seven backpackers,  most of them tourists, a police spokeswoman said.
Police searched homes in the Sydney area and other locations in New South  Wales before the man, identified as a truck driver, and "a number of other  people" were interviewed, a police spokeswoman said.
Hundreds of officers searched up to a dozen homes during the operation,  the Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported.
The truck driver was questioned at his home in the south-western Sydney  suburb of Eagle Vale and was taken to nearby Campbelltown police station "to  assist with their inquiries", police said.
The seven bodies were found in 1992 and 1993 in the thick Belanglo state  forest near Bowral 120 kilometres (75 miles) south of here. The gruesome finds  sparked the biggest murder hunt in Australian history.
The remains were found concealed by branches and leaves in four separate  sites not far from each other between September 1992 and November 1993.
The bodies of Britons Caroline Clark and Joanne Walters, both 22, were  found in September 1992. In October 1993, the remains of Australian  backpackers James Gibson and Deborah Everist were found nearby.
The remains of 20-year-old German Simone Schmidl were found on November 1,  1993, and the bodies of Gabor Neugebauer and his German girlfriend, Anja  Habschied, were found on November 4.
Authories had offered a reward of 500,000 Australian dollars (350,000  U.S.) for information leading to the arrest of the killer.
Police said a four-wheel drive vehicle was probably used to reach isolated  spots where the bodies were found, which had macabre-sounding names such as  Executioner's Gap, Sick Man and Kelly's Drop.
