German government spokesman Dieter Vogel said France and Germany would on  Tuesday unveil a joint initiative for combating racism and xenophobia in  Europe. The text would be formally presented to their European partners at the  Corfu summit on June 24 and 25.
The two leaders propose harmonising the legislation of the various member  states in order to oppose extreme rightwing wing violence and propaganda more  effectively.
"An overall strategy must be developed within the European Union,", Vogel  said.
Diplomats said the push for the initiative came from Kohl who was  particularly concerned over the upsurge in racist violence that has left  dozens of people dead since German reunification and on the harmful effect on  Germany's image abroad.
