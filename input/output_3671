China has developed the most pervasive spy  network in the United States, drawing on tens of thousands of Chinese  diplomats, students and visitors, according to a new book written by a US  intelligence officer.
The book, unusual in that it was written by an active intelligence  official, said US agencies were ill-equipped to deal with Chinese spying,  having devoted much of their resources to Russia and the former Soviet Union.
"The United States and other Western industrialized nations are woefully  unprepared" for dealing with Chinese espionage, said the book by Nick  Eftimiades, a China specialist with the Defense Intelligence Agency.
"There is no question that (China's) espionage activities are more  pervasive
than what we have seen from any other country," he said in the book.
Eftimiades, whose manuscript was reviewed by the government to ensure that  no secrets were revealed, said a favorite technique of China is to plant  agents in the United States for 10 years or more before using them for  intelligence-gathering. These spies are known as "fish at the bottom of the  ocean."
The book says Chinese intelligence uses the 11,500 diplomats as well as  the 15,000 Chinese students who arrive in the United States each year and  hundreds of thousands of Chinese-Americans.
The Chinese are especially interested in US military technology, trade and  foreign policy trends and counteracting dissident groups in China.
The book "Chinese Intelligence Operations," said China took advantage of  the policy of greater US openness to China by former president George Bush to  step up intelligence in the United States.
Eftimiades said US counterintelligence lacks the linguistic skills and  other resources needed to combat Chinese spying, which was virtually ignored  during the Cold War.
He also maintained that Chinese intelligence suffers from sloppiness and  poor organization, but said some of the shortcomings are compensated by sheer  volume.
