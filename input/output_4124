India's no-nonsense election commissioner was  isolated and under fire on Thursday after the Supreme Court overturned his  postponement of polls in the country's most populous state.
The Supreme Court administered a sharp rebuke to the polls chief on  Wednesday by ruling that by-elections in the state of Uttar Pradesh to fill  six seats in the local legislature should go ahead.
Seshan, 62, postponed the Uttar Pradesh polls, which were to have been  held on Thursday, until September after accusing state Chief Minister Mulayam  Singh Yadav of violating electoral rules by using a helicopter for campaigning.
The chief election commissioner grudgingly agreed Wednesday to hold the  elections on May 31 as ordered by the Supreme Court.
Seshan, who normally avoids the press and was busy overseeing by-elections  in 12 other Indian states on Thursday, could not be reached for comment.
But the tough-talking former bureaucrat appeared to be without friends for  once after receiving the rap on the knuckles from India's highest court.
Even the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP, Indian People's  Party), which opposes proposed legislation that seeks to clip Seshan's wings,  expressed its annoyance.
"On some occasions, the election commissioner goes beyond the limits," BJP  spokesman Krishan Lal Sharma said. "There are times when even we do not  approve of his actions."
"This is a welcome decision and has served to correct the totally arbitary  and unwarranted decision taken by (Seshan)," said the Communist Party of India  (Marxist).
Even newspapers which have lionised Seshan for his crusade against  political corruption said the polls chief had overreacted this time.
