Some 3.8 million Malawian voters began voting  Tuesday in a landmark democratic election to break the stranglehold the  self-appointed president for life Kamuzu Banda has held on the country since  independence in 1966.
Some 2,400 polling stations across the country opened at 6:00 a.m. (0400  GMT), and in parts of Blantyre, the economic powerhouse of this mainly rural  country of 9.4 million people, queues started forming at 4:00 a.m. (0200 GMT).
Nearly 300 international observers have been deployed to monitor the poll,  in which Malawians will chose a president from four candidates including Banda  and a parliament from the eight contesting parties.
The major battles will be between Banda and his former aide Bakili Muluzi  and between their respective parties, the Malawi Congress Party and the United  Democratic Front.
Voting booths will stay open for 12 hours during the day, which is not a  public holiday. First results are expected late Wednesday, with an overall  picture emerging Thursday.
