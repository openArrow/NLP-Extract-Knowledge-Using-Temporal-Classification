Dolphin lovers can this week enjoy a guilt-free  tunafish sandwich now that the government has banned seafood which has been  caught by endangering the marine mammels.
The National Marine Fisheries Service estimates that 90 percent of the  tuna sold already meets the requirement, but starting Wednesday only  dolphin-safe tuna can be sold, purchased or shipped in the United States under  the terms of the 1992 Marine Mammel Protection Act.
Dolphins, which swim with tuna, often get netted along with the fish  because fishing fleets would track them in order to find their prey and then  haul them in together.
Some 400,000 dolphins were killed every year in the 1960s and 70s,  sparking a public outcry and prompting some canneries to label their tuna  "dolphin safe."
The National Marine Fisheries Service said the number of dolphin deaths  related to the fishing practice dropped to about 3,600 last year.
