Fifty-three percent of Americans disapprove of  President Bill Clinton's foreign policy and 51 percent give thumbs down to his  overall performance, a Washington Post-ABC News Poll indicated Tuesday.
With what were largely viewed as muddled results in Haiti, North Korea,  China and other areas, only 13 percent of those surveyed believed Clinton had  a clear foreign policy, against 37 percent who said he did not, according to  the poll published by the daily.
His 40-53 percent approval-disapproval rate in foreign policy was the  lowest since 18 American troops were killed in Somalia in October, when  another poll put the same ratio at 43-56 percent.
Asked if Clinton had a clear foreign policy, 37 percent of the respondents  disagreed, 13 percent agreed and 50 percent did not know.
And 50 percent thought Clinton was doing a worse job abroad than his  predecessor George Bush.
His overall approval rate fell from 57 percent in March to 51 percent,  according to the May 12-15 telephone poll of 1,523 adults and with a plus or  minus three percent margin of error.
A strong majority of women approved of Clinton's performance against half  of men, the daily said.
In other issues, Clinton also fared badly: those who believed he has the  honesty and integrity to be president fell to 56 percent from 65 percent in  March, and his health care plan got an approval-disapproval rating of 44-50  percent.
But Clinton's credibility got a boost with the sexual harassment suit  filed against him by former Arkansas civil servant Paula Jones: 35 percent do  not believe her allegations against only 17 percent who do -- the rest had no  opinion.
