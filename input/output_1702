The Dow had been up 8.29 points at 3,728.90 several minutes after the  session opened on the New York Stock Exchange.
Experts had expected the wave of profit taking after the Dow jumped nearly  50 points Tuesday following the Federal Reserve's increase in two key  short-term interest rates. The Wall Street barometer closed at 3,720.61, its  highest level since March 28.
Analysts pointed out that advancing shares outpaced decliners two-to-one,  1,214 to 638. Shares unchanged totaled 723.
On the bond market, interest rates on the main 30-year Treasury bond  averaged 7.26 percent, unchanged from late Tuesday.
