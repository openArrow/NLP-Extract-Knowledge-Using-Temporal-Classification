Costa, seeded 15th, who has reached the fourth round here for the last two  years, was a surprise straight-sets victim of 89th-ranked Hendrick Dreekmann  of Germany.
Dreekmann, 19 and making his Grand Slam tournament debut, now plays  American Richey Reneberg who beat Czech David Rikl 7-6 (9/7), 6-1, 5-7, 6-3.
French-based Haitian Ronald Agenor and 'lucky-loser' David Prisonil wrote  their names into the Championship record books when Agenor completed a 6-7  (4/7), 6-7 (2/7), 6-3, 6-4, 14-12 second-round victory over the German in 5hrs  02mins.
The two players needed to complete 71 games to decide who plays Bruguera  for a place in the last sixteen. That was seven games more than Spaniard  Emilio Sanchez' 3-6, 5-7, 6-3, 6-4, 13-11 second-round win over Australian  Wally Masur in 1992.
Agenor and Prisonil came on court on Wednesday and resumed their  unfinished clash Thursday at 9-9 in the final set.
They needed to stay on court for another 24 minutes to break another  record. The longest-ever Championship match was set in 1984 when John Frawley  beat Hans Schwaier of Germany 6-1, 4-6, 6-3, 6-7, 8-6 in 5hrs 25mins.
Fifth-seed Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia survived a disastrous start on an  outside court to defeat Bryan Shelton of the United States 1-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-4.
Russian hope Yevgeny Kafelnikov also came through, beating Bernd Karbacher  in four sets 6-2, 1-6, 6-2, 6-2.
In the women's singles, Spain's Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Conchita  Martinez advanced down the road to a probable semi-final.
Sanchez took 40 minutes to crush Noelle Van Lottum of France 6-1, 6-0  while Martinez defeated American Ginger Helgeson 6-2, 6-3. Neither have  dropped a set since the tournament began.
In the third round Sanchez plays Germany's Barbara Rottner while Martinez  faces the bigest serve in women's tennis when she takes on Brenda Schultz of  the Netherlands.
The 1991 junior champion Anna Smashnova, who caused a major upset by  putting out Jana Novotna on Tuesday, failed to clear the second hurdle.
The 17-year-old Minsk-born Israeli was overwhelmed by experienced American  Shaun Stafford 4-6, 1-6.
