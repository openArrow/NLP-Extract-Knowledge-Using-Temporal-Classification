Perth mopped up Tuesday after its wildest  storm for 20 years left a trail of damage estimated at many millions of  dollars.
Authorities in the Western Australian capital said it was miraculous there  were no serious injuries as house roofs were blown away, power lines brought  down and half of the city's million-plus population was plunged into darkness  for hours by electricity cuts triggered by winds gusting to 140 kilometers (90  miles) per hour.
Emergency crews worked throughout Monday night and all day Tuesday  removing fallen trees and live power lines from roads.
The State Energy Commission said 50,000 homes were still without power  midday Tuesday.
The State Emergency Service's operations manager, George Sulc, said 1,700  householders made calls for help.
One of the worst affected sections was the Indian Ocean coastal strip from  the port of Fremantle 50 kilometers (30 miles) north to Quinn's Rock, with few  exposed roofs escaping damage.
