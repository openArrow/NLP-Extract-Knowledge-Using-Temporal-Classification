Russia and Ukraine began Tuesday in Moscow a second  day of talks on dividing up the Black Sea fleet while in Kiev the speaker of  the secessionist Crimean republic met with his Ukrainian counterpart.
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin sat down with his Ukrainian  counterpart Efrim Zviagilsky to speed up division of the fleet which has its  home base in the Crimean city of Sevastopol.
"The successful settlement of the issue of dividing up the Black Sea fleet  will stabilise the whole situation in Crimea," Zviagilsky was quoted by  ITAR-TASS as saying.
Ukrainian officials said there was no discussion on the situation in  Crimea and Deputy Defence Minister General Ivan Bijan commented: "What is  there to discuss since Crimea is Ukraine's problem."
Crimean Prime Minister Yevgeny Saburov joined the second day of  Russian-Ukrainian talks called after presidents Boris Yeltsin and Leonid  Kravchuk agreed to divide up the fleet and set up separate bases at a meeting  in Moscow last month.
Crimea, a predominantly Russian-populated republic bordering the Black  Sea, sparked a political crisis when the local parliament voted Friday to  restore a 1992 constitution which grants the region greater autonomy from Kiev.
The Ukrainian parliament immediately responded by declaring the move  "illegal" and giving the local legislature up until Monday to reverse its  decision.
