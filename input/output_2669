In Seoul, the government accused North Korea of attempting to heighten  tension on the Korean peninsula by making an issue out of what Seoul calls  defections, as press reports said another logger had slipped into the country   and asked for asylum Friday.
The government has allowed the loggers to take asylum in the South for  "humanitarian reasons" and in deference to their free will, a National  Unification Board spokesman said.
"We strongly urge North Korea to stop such irresponsible acts that  heighten tension," he said.
Yonhap news agency said, meanwhile, that a logger identified as Chang  Il-Un, 30, had slipped ashore in Inchon Port Friday from a "foreign  freighter," which he had boarded clandestinely.
Chang had escaped from a logging camp in Siberia, and the National  Security Planning agency was investigating the background of his request, the  agency said, without giving further details.
