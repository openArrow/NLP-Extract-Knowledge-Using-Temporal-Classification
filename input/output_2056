German gross domestic product (GDP) for the first  quarter of 1994 is expected to be "significantly higher" than for the same  period in 1993, the economy ministry said on Thursday in its monthly report.
"The economic indicators are increasingly upward-orientated," the ministry  said, observing that in former East Germany the economy was "on a growth  course".
But the labour market in both parts of Germany remained strained.
Demand for industrial products had "considerably grown" in the first  quarter, and this was expected to boost industrial production, the report  said. Above all, export orders had "grown strongly".
Export orders for west German firms increased by a seasonally-corrected  six percent in the first quarter of the year compared with the same period  last year, the ministry said.
