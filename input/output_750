Manchester United's international veteran Bryan  Robson is set to begin his managerial career at Middlesbrough.
The 37-year-old former England skipper, who was overlooked for the Red  Devils' FA Cup win over Chelsea, is touted to take over at the north east  Division One club on Tuesday.
United boss Alex Ferguson, who claimed leaving Robson on the Wembley  sidelines was one of the hardest decisions of his career, said: "Bryan made  his decision during the week. It would be unfair of me to discuss his plans,  but he does have plans. We have had a long chat."
Robson, capped 90 times by England in a career dogged by injury, remained  tight-lipped about the move, leaving Ferguson to do the talking.
"He has been a fantastic player," said Ferguson. "He's been the best  player I have ever had -- and that's not discrediting any member of our club.
"It has been 13 years of complete commitment. Every time every ball has  been kicked, whether it has been in training or in games, he's been in there.  He's been fabulous.
"It really was a tragedy we couldn't put him on the bench against Chelsea.  But there were several factors which I felt decided against that."
"Brian McClair's flexibility made him favourite to go on the bench. I wish  I could have picked two from five substitutes."
Ferguson added: "Management is all about decisions. You stand and fall by  them. But the one thing that Bryan knows, is that I took this decision in the  best interests of Manchester United.
"Someday he will have to make an important decision like that. Because I'm  certain he will go to the top in management. You just have to be honest and  look at things in black and white.
"I spoke to him last night, and said to him: 'If you were a manager next  week, what would you do?' and he said: 'I'd play me!"'
