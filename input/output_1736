Magnus Gustafsson made a dramatic comeback from the edge of defeat to beat  Mark Woodforde and give Sweden victory.
The Swede came from 1-4 and two breaks down in the final set to win 4-6,  7-6 (7/0), 6-4.
"I though the match was gone and I was just trying to stay in it as long  as possible," said Gustafsson, who is suffering from an inflamed shoulder  which could rule him out of Friday's matches and the French Open.
"I overplayed at the beginning of the year because I was winning so many  matches. The schedule was too tough and I was too stupid to stop. I'm having  injections which last about two weeks to kill the pain."
"I'm worried I won't be able to play at the French. That would be a  disaster because that is where I have the best chance to do well."
