Cambodian co-premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh  and Hun Sen said Wednesday they had agreed to hold peace talks in Pyongyang  with the Khmer Rouge without preconditions, in response to an appeal by King  Norodom Sihanouk.
The co-premiers had sent an official letter to the king "saying that we  are ready to go to Pyongyang without ceasefire, without preconditions," Prince  Ranariddh told journalists at Phnom Penh airport. "Let talks begin," he added.
He said that the ceasefire precondition for holding the talks -- which are  also to be attended by National Assembly chairman Chea Sim -- had deadlocked  the peace process.
"We have to do something to overcome the deadlock and my father (King  Sihanouk) said the only one thing to do is to have talks without a ceasefire,"  he added.
"We are going to Pyongyang because we believe that we will have peace and  national reconciliation, otherwise we would not go," he said when asked if he  was optimistic on the prospect of peace emerging from the talks.
Hun Sen said the talks, beginning on May 27, would be based on a peace  plan put forward by King Sihanouk, but added that the government had yet to  get a response from Khmer Rouge nominal leader Khieu Samphan regarding the  proposal.
A statement signed by Khieu Samphan released later Wednesday said the  Khmer Rouge supported King Sihanouk's peace talk initiative, but failed to say  if the rebel leader would attend the proposed meeting.
King Sihanouk has proposed that certain "acceptable" members of the Khmer  Rouge be given senior cabinet posts in the government in exchange for giving  up their zones, ceasing all guerrilla activities and merging their fighters  with the royal armed forces.
Prince Ranariddh has downplayed Khmer Rouge guerrilla activities as "hit  and run," but said that the rebel "threat" had to be stopped for the sake of  the country, adding that King Sihanouk's proposal was the best chance for  peace.
Asked whether he thought foreign military aid would escalate the Cambodian  civil war, the prince said that "insecurity" was rife in Cambodia, and that  action had to be taken against the Khmer Rouge.
But he added that weapons would not be enough and that Cambodia was in dire  need of development and civil programs, as well as a restructuring of its  armed forces.
King Sihanouk last week appealed for military aid from the United States,  France and Australia "to save Cambodia from the yoke of the Khmer Rouge."
Prince Ranariddh confirmed Monday that the government had requested  military support from western powers to fight the Khmer Rouge, a move the  rebel faction has condemned as foreign inteference in Cambodia's internal  affairs.
The co-premiers were seeing off King Sihanouk, who left for Beijing for  medical treatment two weeks earlier than originally scheduled, citing his  frustration at the failure of Cambodia's politicians to accept his peace plan.
The king looked very weak as he arrived in Beijing and had to helped down  the steps of the aircraft.
The king Tuesday called on Khmer Rouge nominal leader Khieu Samphan and  Hun Sen to bury the hatchet and proposed holding peace talks on May 27 at his  residence in North Korea.
But in an interview published Wednesday in the Cambodia Daily, the king  had expressed pessimism at seeing the peace plan get off the ground, partly  because he said Hun Sen was strongly opposed to "any flexibility vis a vis the  Khmer Rouge."
The Khmer Rouge were responsible for the deaths of more than a million  Cambodians during a four-year reign of terror that ended when Vietnamese  troops ousted them from power in late 1978.
