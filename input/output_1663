Economists said that the imposition of sales value added tax (VAT) on  domestic fuel, increased council tax bills and a reduction in mortgage tax  relief (MIRAS) from 25 percent to 20 percent, were largely responsible for the  increase in headline inflation.
The central statistical office (CSO) said that underlying inflation was at  its lowest-ever recorded level. The previous record was in November 1967.
Economists said that although the increase was "alarming" it was likely to  be shrugged off by the government, as the treasury had forecast in March that  there would be a "one-off" increase in April's data.
The public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) showed a budget deficit of  4.35 billion pounds (6.5 billion dollars) in April, the first month of the new  financial year, compared with 11.3 billion pounds in March.
The PSBR was one billion pounds less than forecast. The treasury had  forecast last November that the PSBR for the whole year would be 38 billion  pounds after 46 billion pounds in 1993-1994.
At the same time, retail sales rose 1.2 percent in April from 0.3 percent  in March, with an annual rise of 2.6 in April compared with 2.3 percent, in  line with analysts' expectations.
Economist at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Nick Parsons, said  the figures offered "some encouragement to the authorities with only modest  increases in the more demand-sensitive components of the retail price index."
The minutes of a March 30 monthly meeting between Chancellor of the  Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England governor Eddie George showed that  they had agreed then that recent economic data and market volatility did not  justify a further cut in British rates.
According to the minutes published on Wednesday, Clarke had warned against  waiting too long to cut rates, but agreed with George that the prevailing  volatility in the bond and money markets "accentuated the need for a cautious  approach."
