Two southern Yemeni leaders said Wednesday  they were ready to begin peace negotiations with the north if it first agreed  to stop fighting and withdraw from some areas.
"The solution to the current crisis can only be obtained after a  definitive stop to the war and the withdrawal of all forces to their positions  before May 22, 1990," the leaders said in a statement.
Once fighting stops "we must immediately begin unconditional negotiations  under the auspices of the Arab League to reach a peaceful solution in an Arab  framework," they said in the statement run by the south's press agency.
The statement was signed by the vice president of the presidential council  of the breakaway Yemeni Democratic Republic, Addel Rahman al-Jiffri, the  secretary general of the League of the Sons of Yemen, and by the chairman of  provisional National Salvation Assembly, Anis Hassan Yahia, a member of the  Yemen Socialist Party.
The statement came after officials in the north said they had begun  contacts with senior party representatives in a bid to find a political  solution to the conflict.
"We are ready for dialogue with leaders from the YSP who believe in  unity," Planning Minister Abdelkarim al-Iryani said.
But he ruled out any negotiations with southern leader Ali Salem al-Baid,  the ousted vice president of united Yemen, and with former prime minister  Haidar Abubakr al-Attas.
Troops loyal to Baid, who on Saturday proclaimed an independent Yemeni  Democratic Republic with its capital in Aden, have been at war since May 5  with forces backing President Ali Abdallah Saleh.
The government was ready for a ceasefire provided Yemen Socialist Party  leaders recognised Yemeni unity and "the legitimate authority," Iryani said.
In Cairo, an Egyptian diplomat said the United States had contacted Egypt,  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in an effort to help broker a  ceasefire between the rival leaders.
