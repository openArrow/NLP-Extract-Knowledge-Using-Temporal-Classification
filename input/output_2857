Cambodia's Khmer Rouge guerrillas Sunday denied  being behind a grenade attack on the Malaysian Embassy in Phnom Penh last week.
In a broadcast monitored in Bangkok, Khmer Rouge radio "officially and  completely" denied involvement in the attack, which some have linked to Phnom  Penh's requests for foreign military aid.
Malaysian Embassy staff in Phnom Penh said Friday the chancery was  slightly damaged when a grenade was thrown into the compound early Thursday by  unidentified assailants. No injuries were reported.
In Malaysia, Bernama news agency quoted Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi  as saying there was "a great likelihood" the attackers had mistaken Malaysia  for another country.
Khmer Rouge radio blamed the Phnom Penh government for "acts of  subversion" and other crimes and insecurity in the capital.
It also renewed charges that the United States, France, Australia and  Vietnam were among foreign countries manipulating Phnom Penh in its fight  against the Khmer Rouge.
