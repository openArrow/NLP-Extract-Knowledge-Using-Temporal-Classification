Top American fashion designer Ralph Lauren was fined  two million francs (360,000 dollars) by a commercial court on Wednesday for  copying a tuxedo dress by Yves Saint Laurent.
At the same time, Ralph Lauren was awarded 500,000 francs (87,720 dollars)  in damages and interest for a defamation action which he brought against  Pierre Berge, head of the YSL couture business, for remarks which appeared in  an American newspaper.
The row was over a tuxedo evening dress, which Yves Saint Laurent unveiled  in 1970, and revived for his haute couture autumn-winter collection in  1992-1993, and reworked for his ready-to-wear collection for 1993 in his "Rive  Gauche" line.
In addition to the two million francs awarded to Yves Saint-Laurent  Couture, Rive Gauche, the ready-to-wear arm of the fashion empire, will  receive 200,000 francs (35,090 dollars) in damages.
The court ruling will be published in 10 newspapers selected by Yves Saint  Laurent at a cost of 300,000 francs (52,630 dollars).
