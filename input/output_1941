Former prime minister Bettino Craxi, who was told to  surrender his passport pending corruption enquiries, is in a Tunis hospital  for treatment for diabetes, his wife Anna said in an interview published  Thursday.
The whereabouts of the discredited Craxi, a former Socialist leader who  must answer for some 20 graft allegations, have been uncertain since  investigating magistrates demanded on May 12 that he turn over his passport.
His wife told La Stampa newspaper that he was "certainly not a man who had  fled." The couple have a home in Hammamet on the Tunisian coast, where Anna  Craxi has been living lately.
"I hope that he will be able to return home in Hammamet before the end of  next week. After that, we'll see," she said.
She said examinations by his Tunis doctors found that the 60-year-old  Craxi had suffered a heart attack two years ago.
Last week Milan magistrates heading the so-called "clean hands" corruption  probe that has decimated Italy's former political and business elite ordered  the former Socialist Party leader to turn over his passport so he would not  flee the country or face an international arrest warrant.
His wife said in the interview her husband "was the victim of a colossal  injustice. He is not someone who would flee."
