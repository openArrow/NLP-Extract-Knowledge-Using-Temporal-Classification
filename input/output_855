Japanese automaker Mitsubishi Motor Corp. has  indicated it would hasten technology transfer to Malaysia's car project  following Premier Mahathir Mohamad's warning that he would turn elsewhere for  help, Malaysian officials said Monday.
"I think they have got the message," International Trade and Industry  Minister Rafidah Aziz told AFP.
Rafidah said Mitsubishi officials she met in Tokyo recently were "willing  to look at areas" in the Proton national car project where Malaysia had  expressed concern over the firm's reluctance to impart technology.
Jointly produced by Malaysian parties and Mitsubishi, the Proton is  outselling Japanese makes like Honda and Nissan in Malaysia, where it commands  73 percent share of the passenger car market.
Mitsubishi Motor Corp. and Mitsubishi Corp. hold 17 percent equity in the  nine-year-old Proton venture, a cornerstone of Mahathir's ambitious plan to  make Malaysia an industrialised nation.
Mahathir in March had singled out Mitsubishi's reluctance to allow  Malaysians to design and produce the engine and transmission parts by  themselves and warned that Kuala Lumpur could turn to European, American and  even other Japanese companies.
The Malaysian premier toured the Citroen research centre at Vezily during  a private visit to France on May 5 and test drove several Citroen cars, some  of which were yet to enter the market, officials said.
Indications that Malaysia would continue to deal with Mitsubishi in the  car project came last week when Mahathir praised the Japanese automaker while  witnessing the signing of a tripartite pact in Beijing to produce car engines  and components in China.
"Malaysia has found our Japanese partners very cooperative, particularly  Mitsubishi Motor Corp.," Mahathir was quoted saying at the function.
