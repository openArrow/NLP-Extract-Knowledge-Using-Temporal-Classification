Julius Boros, a two-time US Open  champion and PGA champion, died Saturday while visiting one of his favorite  golf courses. He was 74.
Boros won the US Open in 1952 and 1963, then added the PGA championship in  1968. His exploits earned him a place among the giants of the game, but he  never had the high profile of Ben Hogan, Sam Snead, Arnold Palmer, Gary Player  or Jack Nicklaus.
Boros was PGA player of the year in 1952, when Hogan and Snead were the  game's biggest names, and in 1963, when Palmer, Nicklaus and Player were the  game's vaunted "Big Three."
Boros never seemed to mind being overshadowed, though he did allow himself  a sly poke at the Palmer-Nicklaus-Player faithful after he won the '68 PGA.
"I felt a little reluctant to accept that big check," he said. "I thought  it was already in the bank for one of the Big Three."
Ron Sharpe, director of golf at the Coral Ridge Country Club, said a club  member alerted officials there that someone had passed out while driving a  golf cart on the course Saturday afternoon.
"An assistant went out, and he had obviously died at the time," Sharpe  said. "He has had a bad heart for a long time. I don't know if he had a stroke  or a heart attack."
He said Boros no longer played golf, but he lived on the course and often  rode around in a cart.
After a US PGA Tour career that included 18 victories, Boros helped launch  the Senior Tour in 1980. He continued to play the senior circuit for 10 years.
Boros was inducted in the the PGA Hall of Fame in 1975 and the World Golf  Hall of Fame in 1982. Boros' son, Guy, now plays on the PGA Tour and was  playing in the Colonial at Fort Worth, Texas, this weekend.
"I feel a big loss," said Doug Ford, who loaned Boros the irons he used to  win the 1952 US Open. "I'm glad to see his boy is continuing, and his name  will not die.
"He was a real quiet man, a hell of a player who never got the recognition  he deserved."
