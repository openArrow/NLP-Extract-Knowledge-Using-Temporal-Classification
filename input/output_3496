A high-level two-man mission from the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) left Beijing Tuesday for the North  Korean capital Pyongyang to discuss the controversial replacement of fuel rods  at a nuclear reactor.
They will work out inspection procedures with three IAEA inspectors who  have been in North Korea since May 17.
"We are going for technical talks and expect to be there for three or four  days," said one of the mission members, Demetrius Perricos.
The growing row over Pyongyang's refusal to allow full inspections of two  of its nuclear complexes, suspected by Washington of shielding a secret  weapons programme, has heightened tension on the Korean peninsula.
The IAEA said Thursday that North Korea had begun extracting fuel rods  from its five-megawatt Yongbyon reactor, 90 kilometers (54 miles) north of  Pyongyang, in a "serious violation" of IAEA inspection terms and that it would  inform the UN Security Council.
On Friday, the agency rejected a North Korean proposal to keep fuel rods  from the controversial nuclear reactor in a "safe place under seal" ahead of  resumed talks on the issue, saying it would inhibit verification that no  nuclear material had been diverted for military use.
