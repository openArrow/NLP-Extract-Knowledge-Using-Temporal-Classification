New Zealand's budget surplus in the next  financial year will be about half a billion NZ dollars (285 million dollars)  less than private sector forecasts, Finance Minister Bill Birch said Wednesday.
Private sector economists' predictions of the 1994-95 surplus range past  the one billion dollars mark, said Birch in a newsletter to business and  financial circles, adding the government was expecting the fiscal profile  through to 1995-96 to be consistent with the October 1993 pre-election update.
"That is, the 1994-95 fiscal result is likely to be similar to this  year's, with substantial improvement unlikely until 1995-96," he said.
For the current financial year, the Treasury is forecasting a surplus of  up to 300 million dollars. The pre-election update projected a deficit in the  1993-94 financial year of 1.442 billion dollars and in 1994-95 a deficit of  1.194 billion dollars, a year-on-year improvement of 248 million dollars.
A spokesman for Birch said: "We haven't talked figures at all, but what we  have said is that the basic shape of the profile between the two years is  expected to stay the same."
It is expected the rate of improvement affecting this year's figures will  not be maintained.
The government now expects the year-on-year increase in the surplus next  financial year to be limited to around 250 million dollars, as forecast in the  pre-election update.
This would deliver a 1994-95 surplus of not more than half a billion  dollars, compared with private sector forecasts ranging past the one billion  dollar mark.
Foreign debt is currently about 66 billion dollars. In the 12 months ended  last March, 12 percent of government spending, or 3.899 billion dollars, was  allocated to debt servicing.
