A last-gasp Iraqi goal against Japan allowed South  Korea to steal into their third straight World Cup finals -- but coach Kim Ho  does not expect any more favours at USA '94.
Pitted against defending champions Germany, Spain and Bolivia, Kim knows  his rank outsiders will probably head straight out again after the group C  qualifying round.
But although resigned to failure, the South Koreans are determined to put  in a creditable performance that will give them the edge in their battle with  Japan to host the 2002 finals.
"My boys are being asked to play their best and give a good impression to  world fans," the coach said.
"The better our players perform, the better South Korea's chances will be  to host the 2002 world championship," added Park Sung-Kuk, spokesman for the  South Korean Bidding Committee.
Japan's bid took a severe knock with their failure to reach the US finals.
This will be South Korea's fourth World Cup finals since 1954 and they  have yet to win a match at any of them. In 1990 they managed one goal, against  Spain, and no team had fewer shots on goal.
A first win would be a triumph and Kim's hopes rest on an upset over  Bolivia.
Kim admitted the South Korean team has too many "weak spots" to seriously  challenge. Since the qualifying contest, when Iraq grabbed a last minute  equaliser against Japan in the final match to put South Korea through, Kim has  been working on building up physical strength especially in attack.
"We can play better if we adopt a quick attack system," he said.
The final 22-man squad has not yet been announced but there is growing  pressure to bring back Kim Joo-sung, veteran of the World Cup in Italy who  plays with German second division side VfL Bochum.
The 28-year-old midfielder was criticised for lazy performances during  last year's qualifiers. But many fans believe his experience will boost South  Korea's chances.
