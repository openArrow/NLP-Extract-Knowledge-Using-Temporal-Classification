Malawi's newly-elected President Bakili Muluzi  arrived Tuesday morning in Maputo for a brief visit on his first foreign trip  since taking office.
Muluzi said on arrival that "Mozambique is a very important neighbour for  Malawi".
He confirmed that he would discuss with Mozambican President Joaquim  Chissano the controversial issue of Malawi's Young Pioneers who illegally  crossed into Mozambique last December.
Some members of the Young Pioneers, a paramilitary group created by former  Malawian president Kamuzu Banda, are said to be hiding in Mozambique under the  protection of the opposition Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO).
Muluzi said in Maputo that "the Young Pioneers are a concern to Malawi,  now we have a democratic government", and that he would like to resolve the  matter.
"They are Malawians and must come back to Malawi", he said.
