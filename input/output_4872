An Indian court has asked a local clone of  Playboy to stop publication in an interim ruling on a trademark infringement  suit brought by the US adult magazine.
Playboy Enterprises Inc., sued publishers of Playway in the Delhi High  Court alleging the Indian publication was trying to pass itself off as the  original, which is not circulated in the country.
Judge Mahinder Narain made a temporary injunction against publication of  Playway on Thursday and set a new hearing for August. The judge also issued  summons to Playway publisher Bharat Malik.
"Playboy is a registered trade mark and the Indian magazine has a  deceptively similar format in as much as it is a sex-oriented magazine for the  adult urban male," Pravin Anand, local lawyer for Playboy, told AFP on  Saturday.
"It has a readers' page about their sexual fantasies, articles about  sexual and social ills, cartoons relating to sex, interviews, centrespreads,  nude and semi-nude pictures," he said.
"People would either think this is an Indian version of Playboy or they  would consider this is the magazine they have been hearing about," the lawyer  said.
"Deception and confusion are likely and could dilute the Playboy  magazine's trademark if and when they are permitted to enter India," he said.
