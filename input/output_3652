Xoliswa Falati, who was convicted with Winnie  Mandela on kidnapping and assault charges, was Tuesday ordered by a judge to  stop making defamatory statements about the estranged wife of President Nelson  Mandela.
Falati had planned to call a press conference Tuesday, according to her to  "expose more atrocities" about Winnie Mandela.
"There is going to be a hurricane," Falati said in a weekend press  interview. "I have living witnesses."
She said she was not safe keeping quiet nor safe speaking out. "So I will  speak."
Mandela, appointed 12 days ago as Deputy Minister of Arts, Culture,  Science and Technology, applied in the Supreme Court here for an urgent  interdict preventing Falati from making defamatory statements about her.
Judge Levy postponed the hearing until June 14 to allow Falati time to  file answering affidavits but told her she would be charged with contempt of  court if she went ahead with the press conference or made any statements about  Mandela.
Falati's lawyer said his client had agreed to abide by the order.
Mandela was convicted in 1991 with Falati on charges of kidnapping and  assault, arising out of the abduction of four Soweto youths and the subsequent  killing of 14-year-old Stompie Moeketsi Sepei at Mandela's Soweto home in  December 1988.
The supreme court sentenced Mandela to six years in prison, but this was  reduced to a 15,000 rand (4,500 dollar) fine by the appeal court last June.
Falati, however, was made to serve part of a one-year prison sentence, a  fact which she bitterly resents.
Winnie Mandela separated from her husband in April 1992 after newspapers  published a love letter she allegedly wrote to a young lawyer.
