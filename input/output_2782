Russian President Boris Yeltsin will meet with  Chechnya's separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev in a bid to defuse the crisis in  the Caucasus region, ITAR-TASS news agency reported Saturday.
Sergei Filatov, head of the president's office, did not give the date of  the proposed meeting which could be a starting point for normalizing relations  between Russia and its separatist region which proclaimed independence in late  1991.
Russia imposed an economic blockade on the Caucasus republic that has long  been riven by mafia violence and inter-ethnic strife.
Filatov who made an attempt earlier this year to end the separatist  dispute said that Yeltsin dismissed Sergei Shakhrai from his post as  nationalities minister earlier this month because of the Chechnyan crisis.
Shakhrai who is also deputy prime minister called for early elections in  Chechnya before the start of reconciliation talks. He also wanted opponents to  the Chechnyan leader to join the negotiations.
Yeltsin has so far not accepted Shakhrai's resignation as deputy premier.
