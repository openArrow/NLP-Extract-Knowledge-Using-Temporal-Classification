The legendary Czech-born American will be making her last visit to the  famous stadium. At 37 she has decided to call it a day at the end of the year  and this tournament will mark her 65th 'Grand Slam' event. Navratilova, who  has won 17 major singles titles, holds a remarkable career record of 167  tournament wins. After taking the trophy at this year's Indoor Paris Open,  Navratilova said she thought she could still cause upsets at the major events.  She can certainly be relied upon to go down fighting. It will be her first  visit to the tournament since 1988. She decided to skip the event in  sunsequent years to concentrate on Wimbledon. Winner of the French Open crown  in 1982 and 1984, the slow surface limits the effectiveness of Navratilova's  aggressive tennis.
Strengths: Experience and Power
Weaknesses: Surface
JANA NOVOTNA (Czech x5)
Best remembered for weeping on the Dutchess of Kent's shoulder after  losing last year's Wimbledon final, the 25-year-old Novotna is not at her best  on clay -- although she has managed to reach one semi-final and three  quarter-finals in her eight visits since 1986. She has been coached by former  French Open champion Hana Mandlikova since 1990 and is still looking for a  first major title.
Strenghths: Excellent mobility
Weaknesses: Tendency to choke after reaching winning position
GABRIELA SABATINI (Argentina x8)
However disappointing her results in recent months, Roland Garros can  bring out the best in the 24-year-old South American. She has reached five  semi-finals in nine previous visits and has never gone out of the event before  the fourth-round. Has not got an easy draw and should face Graf in the  quarter-finals.
Strengths: Excellent clay-court game
Weaknesses: Service
