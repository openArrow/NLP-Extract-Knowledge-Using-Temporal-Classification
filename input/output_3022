Filmmakers from Algeria, Cambodia, Canada,  China, Russia and the Gaza Strip received early distinctions in the Cannes  filmfest Sunday, a day ahead of the announcement of this year's coveted Golden  Palm.
At the head of a group of prizes announced on the eve of the end of the  festival, Canadian Atom Egoyan's "Exotica" was awarded the International  Critics' Prize (FIPRESCI) for films in the official competition here.
The FIPRESCI judges said Egoyan's movie showed his "ability to reveal a  private world, at once rich and mysterious, through an audacious and  full-realized film technique."
The film is an erotic thriller about a man obsessed with a girl at a strip  club, only gradually unravelling the strange motivation for his interest.
"Exotica" is one of the handful of films seen as possible outside  contenders for prizes in the main awards to be announced Monday, including the  Golden Palm.
The FIPRESCI prize for a film in the other parallel sections of the  festival -- Un Certain Regard, Directors' Fortnight and Critics' Week -- went  to Algerian Merzak Allouache's "Bab el-Oued City."
The citation commended the movie's "simplicity, which reflects upon the  intolerance which can poison a society."
Meanwhile the Ecumenical jury awarded their annual prize jointly to  Chinese director Zhang Yimou's "To Live" and Russian Nikita Mikhalkov's "Burnt  by the Sun."
That prize, which will be awarded Monday in the presence of Prince Albert  of Monaco, is for films "which stress the desire for happiness, the innocence  of children and human dignity," a statement said.
