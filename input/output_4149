China is set for another underground hydrogen  bomb test that will come within days of US President Bill Clinton's expected  decision to renew trading privileges for China, The New York Times said  Thursday.
The timing of the detonation, western diplomats told the daily in Beijing,  is meant to signal China's independence from Washington.
Clinton could announce as early as Thursday his decision to renew China's  favorable trade access to the US market despite its sketchy progress on human  rights issues, on which the low-tariff privileges were conditioned.
China's nuclear testing policy, which the unidentified sources said was  necessary to maintain and modernize the nuclear arsenal, has also come under  fire at a time when other nuclear powers are practicing restraint.
Clinton protested strongly against China's detonation of a 90-kiloton  nuclear device in October.
The diplomats said that instruments to monitor the nuclear blast were  believed to be in place near the underground test range at Lop Nor, in Xinjian  Province -- a reliable sign that a detonation was imminent.
"Even with the background of military necessity for these tests, I think  the Chinese are demonstrating that they cannot be pushed around -- that the  United States cannot dictate the ccourse of Chinese actions," former US  ambassador to Beijing Arthur Hummell told the daily.
