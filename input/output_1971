China confirmed Thursday that it had agreed to  visits by technicians from the Voice of America (VOA) to discuss alleged  Chinese jamming of broadcasts by the US radio network.
The move is an apparent concession to US President Bill Clinton who made  the cessation of radio jamming by the Chinese authorities one of the  conditions for renewal of China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) status with the  United States.
"The Chinese side has agreed with the US side to send technicians to China  to talk about technical matters, such as the question of overlapping  frequencies," Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said.
However, he stressed that China did not jam VOA broadcasts and dismissed  any linkage of the issue with the MFN debate.
"There is no such thing as the jamming of VOA by China," Wu said.
"The study of the technical problem of broadcasting frequency overlapping  by the experts from the two sides, has nothing to do with MFN trade status,"  he added.
Clinton must make a decision on MFN renewal by June 3.
According to a US embassy official, one technician has already arrived in  Beijing and will soon begin discussions with Chinese colleagues "to review  information concerning possible interference with VOA radio signals."
VOA has repeatedly accused the Chinese of interfering with their broadcast  frequencies, specifically those used by the network's Chinese service.
Beijing is especially sensitive to the issue of foreign broadcasts and has  reacted angrily to US plans to set up a "Radio Free Asia", broadcasting into  China and other Asian countries.
China says the plan is an attempt by the United States to sow confusion  and discord in the region.
