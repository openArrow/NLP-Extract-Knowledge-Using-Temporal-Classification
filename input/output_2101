Somali warlord General Mohamed Farah Aidid  returned to Mogadishu on Thursday after nearly six months' absence from  Somalia, UN spokesman George Bennett told AFP by telephone from the Somali  capital.
Aidid, who heads the Somali National Alliance (SNA) faction, has been out  of the country since December 2 when he flew out aboard a US military aircraft  for the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa to attend Ethiopian-brokered Somali  reconciliation talks.
His return comes nearly two months after he and his main rival,  self-styled president Ali Mahdi Mohamed, concluded a peace accord in the  Kenyan capital committing them to observe a ceasefire in the war-torn country.
Their Nairobi declaration came on the eve of the US pullout from Somalia,  and was signed by Aidid and Ali Mahdi for the 12 factions opposed to the SNA.
Aidid has remained in the Kenyan capital since December, from where he had  occasionally travelled to neighbouring countries in the region, as squabbles  over territory continued back at home, degenerating into pitched clan battles.
Last week, Aidid's Habr Gedir clan battled the Hawadle clan that had  controlled the Mogadishu airport before the first US troops landed in December  1992.
Aidid's clansmen managed to disloge their Hawadle rivals from houses  around the airport, but it prompted bloody retaliation by the Hawadle, who  killed up to 20 Habr Gedir clansmen in the centre of the country, Somali and  UN sources said.
His return could, however, facilitate current UN efforts to bring  Somalia's 16 warring clan-based factions to the negotiating table for talks  that would pave way for the convening of a national reconciliation conference.
