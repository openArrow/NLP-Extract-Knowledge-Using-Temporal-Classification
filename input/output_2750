Willie Carson survived a stewards' inquiry at The  Curragh to give trainer John Dunlop his first Irish 1,000 Guineas triumph in  24 years with the American filly Mehthaaf.
Hemmed in by Irishman Mick Kinane's Dancing Action, Carson bumped Cash  Asmussen's mount Relatively Special as he made his move for the front at six  furlongs, costing the US jockey a length and probable second place.
However, after a stewards' inquiry, the result was confirmed, giving  Carson revenge over John Reid's English 1,000 Guineas winner, Las Meninas, who  had to settle for second place.
After her disappointing fourth place at Newmarket, Mehthaaf was clearly  more at home on the softer going and would probably have started favourite but  for the local support for Tommy Stack's horse.
Mehthaaf shared the pace beyond the half-way stage with Salvezza,  Relatively Special, Dancing Action, Las Meninas and Miss Sacha.
But just over a furlong from the line, Carson's mount found the form that  had taken her victory in the Nell Gwyn stakes as Stack's worst fears were  confirmed and the Robert Sangster owned filly finally showed her frailty on  the soft turf.
