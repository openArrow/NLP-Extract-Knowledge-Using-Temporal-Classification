Vietnam Airlines has signed a deal with Delta  Airlines Inc. to coordinate schedules as a way to tap into potential lucrative  route to the United States ahead of direct air links, a report said Wednesday.
Under the deal, the two airlines will coordinate schedules through an as  yet undetermined Asian hub to allow easy transfers for passengers flying  between the two countries, the Vietnam News Agency said.
The US carrier is the first of several American suitors to sign an  agreement with thew Vietnamese flag carrier following Washington's lifting of  its trade embargo in February.
Delta and Vietnam airlines are to begin the service in the next few months  once final details have been worked out, the report said.
Vietnam Airlines has been eager to sign a code-sharing deal that would  link its flights with a US carrier as a way of getting a share of the market  in the United States, which is home to more than a million overseas  Vietnamese.
United Airlines and Northwest held talks with the Vietnamese airline in  February and expressed interest in tie-ups.
Direct flights will not be possible until the two countries sign an  agreement on air links, which could still be some time off. The two are still  negotiating to open liaison offices as the first step towards normalising  ties.
The state-owned airline has become one of the most successful businesses  in Vietnam and is currently negotiating jet purchases with European consortium  Airbus Industrie and US manufacturer Boeing to replace its remaining  Soviet-made planes.
Under the US embargo it was not able to purchase aircraft from either of  the companies as Airbus jets contain US-made components.
