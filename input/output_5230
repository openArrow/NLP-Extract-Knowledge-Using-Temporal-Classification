Police estimated 500,000 people jammed the infield and outer grandstands,  joining a global television audience to watch racers drive 200 laps along the  2.5-mile (4 km) oval. At top speeds, the fastest cars lap in 39 or 40 seconds.
Roberto Guerrero's 20th-lap crash sent then leader Unser and second-place  teammate Fittipaldi to the pits. Fittiapldi's crew finished in 11 seconds and  the Brazilian grabbed the lead he would keep, except for pit stops, until the  crash.
Unser's engine stalled after the stop and he had to be pushed back into  place and restarted, dropping him into third on lap 23.
"I wanted to be easy on the clutch and I was too easy," Unser said.
England's Nigel Mansell finished 22nd after being struck from behind by  rookie Dennis Vitolo during a caution period. Mansell suffered a concussion  and a minor burn.
Michael Andretti was running third before suffering a flat tire, then  stalling in the pits to fall well back, continuing his family's hard luck  here.    He still crossed the finish line third but he was assessed a one-lap  penalty for passing during a caution period and fell to sixth, allowing Bobby  Rahal to claim third.
Mario Andretti, drove only 23 laps before an engine problem ended his 29th  and final Indy 500 bid in 32nd place, one spot ahead of last-placed Roberto  Guerrero.
"It's a big letdown for something as stupid as this," Andretti said. "It's  disappointing when you're competitive and it's early. Everything was paying  off. Now it's over."
