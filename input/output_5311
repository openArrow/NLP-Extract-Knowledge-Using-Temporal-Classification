An Italian banker has been jailed here in  connection with the fraud case involving French industrialist Didier  Pineau-Valencienne, prison officials said Monday.
They said Valentino Foti, whose arrest "came at about the same time as  Friday's detention of Pineau-Valencienne," is the main stockholder of the  Belgian real estate and financial company Patience et Beaujonc, a subsidiary  of industrial giant Schneider SA.
Pineau-Valencienne is head of Schneider SA, which in October 1993 filed  suit against six Belgian newspapers asking for more than 400 million francs  (70 million dollars) in damages for articles alleging a link between the Swiss  bank Fimo, headed by Foti, and money laundering of drug money.
The charges against Pineau-Valenciennne, specifically forgery, using false  documents, fraud, false accounting and breach of confidence, are related to  the money laundering allegations and, in particular, to two Schneider  subsidiaries, Cofibel and Cofimines.
In November 1992, Schneider offered shares in the two subsidiaries for   public sale. A dispute arose over the price at which the shares were offered  on the open market.
Pineau-Valencienne was charged with fraud and held here at dawn Friday  after being quizzed by investigators for more than 20 hours. He had travelled  to the Belgian capital voluntarily to answer questions.
Under Belgian law he can be held for five days, until Wednesday, when he  must appear before a judge.
