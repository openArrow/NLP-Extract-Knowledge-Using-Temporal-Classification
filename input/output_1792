Welsh football's under-fire chief  executive Alun Evans has been told to carry on.
Evans, 51, was reported to have resigned on Tuesday after being censured  by the Football Association of Wales for making an unsanctioned loan of 53,000  pounds, since repaid, to another sporting organisation. The resignation was  later denied by the FAW.
Evans was also the prime mover in the sacking of Wales' popular manager  Terry Yorath, and his subsequent replacement by John Toshack, a reign that  lasted one match.
The FAW council confirmed after lengthy discussions here on Wednesday that  the former schoolteacher would remain in his post.
But they have decided to advertise for a senior administrator to help out  until Evans, currently on sick leave, is fit enough to return to his 47,000  pound a year job.
Even then the administrator will be retained, with the FAW determining  both men's job descriptions.
Evans had claimed the controversial loan had been approved at the time by  FAW president Elfed Ellis, who has since died. But Ellis's family have denied  this and demanded an apology.
Evans, a qualified football coach and rugby union referee, took over as  secretary of the FAW in 1982, becoming chief executive later the same year.
