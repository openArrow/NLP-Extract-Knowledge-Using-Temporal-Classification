Slow court specialist Thomas Muster of Austria, said: "The fact that there  isn't a single absentee for the tournament among the top 150 players in the  world proves the point. Everybody likes playing on clay, whatever their style."
Even big-serving Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia, whose power tennis is  best-suited to grass on hard courts, said: "It is fun to play on clay --  although of course it depends who you are playing. I play the same way on any  surface. The only difference on clay is that I have to hit the ball more times  because it keeps coming back over the net."
