Six people were injured when a grenade left over  from the Iran-Iraq war exploded accidently in Nudsheh, close to Paveh on the  border with Iraq.
The official agency IRNA said the blast happened as one of the injured was  handling the grenade.
Hundreds of civilians have been killed and injured by shells and mines  which are strewn across the border region of western Iran, remnants of the  intense fighting between Iran and Iraq from 1980 to 1988.
