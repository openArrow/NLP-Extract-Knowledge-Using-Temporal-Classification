What the seeds have been saying at the French Open  this week.
"Yeah. Absolutely. We need to get younger kids playing tennis instead of  basketball. But the New York kids will definitely be louder than the Paris  kids." -- PETE SAMPRAS (USA x1), asked if he thought 'Children's Day' at  Roland Garros should be extended to other major tournaments.
"It was one of those days I should have stayed in bed." -- MICHAEL STICH  (Germany x2) after crashing in straight-sets in the second round to Aaron  Krickstein.
"You translate it in English. You sign your name there. Then I can sue  you," -- ANDREI MEDVEDEV (Ukraine x4), pleading with the press to be accurate  and not "kill tennis."
"I can tell you the secret...but then I have to kill you." -- JIM COURIER  (USA x7) to a journalist who asked about his psychological preparation.
"Maybe we should just have a good old brawl...guys streaming out of the  locker-rooms onto the court and picking sides and fighting in teams -- Europe  versus America. Maybe that is what you need?" -- JIM COURIER asked how to  brighten up tennis.
"I can play a little bit of tennis too, sometimes." -- THOMAS MUSTER  (Austria x11) asked how he had built up a record of four out of five wins  against Andre Agassi.
"I was really upset when I heard the news. But maybe it will be a turning  point for her. Maybe it will make her look back and see what she has achieved.  Hopefully it will have a positive effect." -- STEFFI GRAF (Germany x1) on the  drug arrest of Jennifer Capriati.
"I have never done that before and I hope I will never do that again. But  I was so disappointed." -- MARTINA NAVRATILOVA (USA x4) after smashing her  racket on court during her first round defeat against Miriam Oremans.
"She is going to leave a big gap." -- STEFFI GRAF on Navratilova's  retirement at the end of the year.
"I guess things are not going very well right now." -- GABRIELA SABATINI  (Argentina x8) after being beaten in her first Championship match.
