Japanese electrical machinery maker Omron Corp. said  Thursday its pre-tax earnings rose seven percent from a year earlier to 7.5  billion yen (73 million dollars) in the year to March despite increased sales.
The country's biggest manufacturer of control components said sales were  up 1.7 percent to 370 billion yen in the same period, mainly supported by  increased sales of electronic-funds-transfer systems.
Omron said the outlook for the current year looked "bleak" but forecast a  higher profit of eight billion yen on increased revenue of 375 billion yen.
The company attributed its higher profit to its management program aimed  at "creating a streamlined, strengthened and high value-added corporate  structure, capable of improving profitability even in times of static sales  growth."
"The profit growth was achieved despite the economy-wide slow recovery in  corporate profits, the increasing value of the yen and the severe lack of  investment outlay combined with the restraint in consumer spending," it said.
During the year, sales of control components and systems edged down 0.5  percent to 199 billion yen but sales of electronic-funds-transfer systems grew  four percent to 78 billion yen, the company said.
Sales of speciality products were almost unchanged at 41 billion yen but  sales of public information and traffic control systems increased 18 percent  to 20 billion yen. Sales of health equipment were flat at 26 billion yen, as  were sales of open systems and other items which came to six billion yen.
