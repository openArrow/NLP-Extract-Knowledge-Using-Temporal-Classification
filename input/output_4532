A conference to promote stability in Europe resumed  here Friday aimed at preventing border conflicts in eastern Europe and solving  problems over ethnic minorities.
The two-day conference, which opened at UNESCO headquarters here on  Thursday, was expected to set up two regional round tables, one dealing with  the problems of Russian minorities in the three Baltic states, and the other  with Hungarian minorities in Slovakia and Romania.
Accords reached at the round tables will be enshrined in a Stability Pact  which could be signed early in 1995 and registered with the Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).
The conference is sponsored by France and the European Union to defuse  potential conflicts between would-be candidates to the EU from eastern and  central Europe.
