Shadow home secretary Tony Blair has unexpected  backing from powerful unionists, according to the latest opinion poll Thursday  -- fueling speculation he will win a Labour leadership contest this summer.
Blair is backed by 37 percent of union levy-payers to the opposition  Labour party, according to the NOP poll carried out for the BBC and the  Independent -- despite earlier suggestions the unions, who wield a third of  the vote in the leadership struggle, were likely to be hostile to his  candidature.
The boost for Blair follows Wednesday's announcement Labour will hold the  leadership contest as soon as possible, giving the result on July 21 rather  than running a four-month campaign until October.
The NOP poll placed Blair substantially ahead of his nearest rivals,  employment spokesman John Prescott on 22 percent and shadow chancellor Gordon  Brown on 21 percent.
Meanwhile, acting deputy leader Margaret Beckett polled 12 percent and  shadow secretary of state for trade and industry Robin Cook seven percent.
Although Blair was already widely considered the front-runner, it had been  suggested the unions were less favourable than most to his election because  some believe he would like to break the traditional Labour Party-trade union  link.
Nominations in the leadership contest, which follows John Smith's death,  will open on June 10, the day after European elections.
At the same time, a separate race will be run for the deputy leadership,  following the offer by acting leader Beckett to open up the contest for her  post, which need not have been contested until the autumn.
With more than four million party members and trade union levy-payers  eligible to vote, it will be the biggest party leadership election ever held  in the Britain.
NOP conducted the poll by telephone among 502 levy-payers on Monday and  Tuesday of this week.
