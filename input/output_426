Bangkok police arrested four young Russian women  on prostitution charges after raiding two hotels in the capital, news reports  said Saturday.
A Thai woman, Darin Chitklaew, 43, also was arrested in the raids on  Friday and charged with procurring customers, they said. Police said the  Russians had admitted travelling to Thailand in January on tourist visas to  work as prostitutes.
Bangkok police arrested four other Russian women on prostitution charges  in March.
News reports have said that more than 3,000 Russians were now working as  prostitutes here. One Thai language daily said there were more than 11,000.  But Thai officials say the influx started after the disintegration of the  former Soviet Union.
Police said the women faced a maximum fine of 1,000 baht (40 dollars) and  deportation.
