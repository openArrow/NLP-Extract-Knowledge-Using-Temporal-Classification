Authorities imposed a one-month state of alert  Saturday over the breakaway Caucasus republic of Chechnya following an  overnight failed assassination attempt against President Dzhokar Dudayev.
Dudayev emerged unhurt from a car-bomb attack near the capital Grozny in  which his interior minister and deputy as well as their driver were killed, a  presidential spokesman said. Sunday was declared a day of mourning.
The cabinet of the Moslem republic, which has declared independence, met  in emergency session after the attack to agree the curfew's imposition.
Spokesman Movladi Udugov said a remote-controlled booby-trapped Zhiguli  car exploded as the president's motorcade was passing late Friday.
Dudayev's Interior Minister Magomed Eldiyev, his deputy Said Ali Bateyev   and their driver were killed, Udugov said. They were travelling in the first  vehicle of the motorcade. Dudayev was in the second car, which was jolted by  the blast.
It was not clear who carried out the attack. However, a spokesman for  Dudayev, whilst not directly implicating Moscow, stressed an examination of  debris from the attack showed the explosives used were "of the same kind as  those used by the Russian secret service in operations of sabotage and  terrorism."
But General Dudayev, who proclaimed Chechenya's independence in 1991, also   faced internal opposition from several camps and observers believe one of his  rivals could have carried out the bombing.
Tension between Grozny and Moscow has run high since November 1991 when  the tiny republic declared independence.
Dudayev was returning to the Chechen capital from his native village of  Zakan-Yurt, some 20 kilometres (12 miles) away, when the bomb went off.
Two days earlier, Dudayev had put his armed forces on alert, warning of  "an attempt by Moscow to expand the implementation of a state of emergency"  along Chechnya's border with Ingushetia "in the regions of Sunzha and  Malgobek."
Chechnya, where even basic products are in short supply, is a mafia hotbed.
Three months ago, key opposition member General Ibragim Suleimenov called  for Dudayev's resignation and for "air strikes on the republic's  installations." He was arrested and jailed two days later.
Dudayev refused to sign the Russian Federation Treaty and the republic  boycotted Russian polls last December. Moscow responded with an economic  blockade.
Dudayev also imposed a previous curfew after about 1,000 armed opponents  gathered in Grozny's main square. Amid the continuing standoff with Moscow,  Dudayev had periodically put the Chechen security forces on alert, a move he  repeated on Thursday.
Despite the resumption of bilateral talks in March, Chechenya and Russia  remain at odds, with Gronzy several times accusing Moscow's secret services of  provocation. In March 1993, Chechen authorities said Russia masterminded the  killing of two of Dudayev's advisors in London. One Armenian was eventually  convicted of the killings.
