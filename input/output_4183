International negotiators were  considering presenting a take-it-or-leave-it peace plan Thursday to Bosnia's  belligerants, who are balking at European proosals to carve-up the country, a  diplomat close to the talks said.
The diplomat said the "contact group" of European, UN, US and Russian  negotiators were ready to try to impose a territorial solution on the warring  parties, presumably by threatening to withdraw peacekeeping forces from Bosnia  if the new plan was rejected.
The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said closed-door  negotiations which began at this French Alpine resort on Wednesday between the  contact group and Bosnia's Croats, Moslems and Serbs "did not bring any new  elements" despite earlier reports of progress.
"Each party is sticking to their earlier position, whereby the idea of  considering a more authoritarian approach," the source said.
He said Wednesday's talks focussed exclusively on constitutional issues  and the territorial carve-up of Bosnia.
"There was no mention of the fighting," he said.
The contact group held separate talks with each of the Bosnian delegations  representing the country's Moslems, Croats and Serbs, the source added.
There have been no official comments on progress, but a member of the  Croat press contingent who said he had access to the meeting reported  Wednesday that the Croats and Moslems, who have agreed to form a federation,  had dropped demands for more territory.
He said they had agreed to negotiate on the basis of a European Union plan  backed by the contact group which would allot 51 percent of Bosnian territory  to the Moslem-Croat federation and 49 percent to the Serbs.
The Moslems and Croats now control 30 percent of the republic's territory  and were demanding 58 percent -- corresponding to the areas which had Croat  and Moslem majorities before the two-year-old war. Bosnian Serbs control the  remaining 70 percent of the territory.
France and Britain, the main providers of troops for the UN peacekeeping  operation, have warned they might pull their soldiers out of Bosnia by the end  of the year if no serious progress is made towards restoring peace.
The talks here were to wind up Thursday and are expected to resume in about  10 days at a location not yet announced to prepare a conference of foreign  ministers around mid-June as a follow-up to one in Geneva on May 13.
