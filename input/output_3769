Taiwan will allow more foreign institutions to join  its stock market as part of its financial liberalization drive, officials said  Wednesday.
The Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) said foreign institutions will  be allowed to invest up to 10 percent of the stock market value, about 18  billion US dollars, up from seven percent at present.
The move, endorsed Tuesday by the Central Bank of China, is aimed at  attracting more foreign capital to boost the local bourse and to help  strengthen the island's bid to become a regional financial hub, they said.
Foreign institutions have invested a total of 3.67 billion dollars in  mostly blue-chip stock.
