Saudi Arabia's flag carrier will resume its flights  to the Lebanese capital next week, after a 10-year break because of the war,  the Saudi ambassador announced Monday.
Abdallah al-Kuhaimi told reporters that Saudia would start flights to  Beirut International Airport after the Moslem feast of Al-Adha, on Saturday.
Saudia will be the 19th foreign company to fly to Beirut since the 15-year  war ended in 1990.
Most airlines suspended flights after the hijacking of a US TWA plane to  Beirut in 1985, when gunmen murdered one passenger and kept the rest hostage  for a month.
US companies are still boycotting Beirut as Washington bans its citizens  from travelling to the country until the Lebanese government disarms the  pro-Iranian Hezbollah militia, which backed hostage-taking.
