Four armed men took some 30 people hostage on  Thursday in a bus near the northern Caucasus town of Mineralnoye Vody and  demanded 10 million dollars ransom, a helicopter, arms, and drugs, the Russian  ministry for emergency situations announced.
The bus was travelling between Vladikavkaz, in the Caucasus republic of  North Ossetia, in Russia, and Stavropol in southern Russia.
The ministry said the men were armed with submachine-guns and a grenade.
They demanded a helicopter -- but one without a crew -- as well as four  more submachine-guns, a grenade-launcher, four flak-jackets, night-sight  scopes, and drugs, the ministry said.
