Sony Corp. on Thursday blamed the failure of  big-budget movies at the box office for its overall operating loss of 4.4  billion yen (43 million dollars) in the United States last year.
Company officials said the loss in the year to March, reversing an  operating profit of 35 billion yen a year earlier, reflected "errors" with  such movies as "Last Action Hero" and "Geronimo" which did not do well.
Sony's share of the box office in the United States subsequently dropped  to less than 19 percent, from 20 percent in the two previous years.
Overall entertainment revenue was down five percent at 789 billion yen  with increased music sales offset by reduced revenue from movies.
Music sales grew 3.4 percent to 462 billion yen, supported by sales of  Maria Carey's latest album which sold 10 million copies. Billy Joel's latest  album sold six million copies and strong sales were also reported for Michael  Bolton, Michael Jackson, Soul Asylum, Spin Doctors and Sade.
But movie revenue tumbled 14.8 percent to less than 328 billion yen,  despite such box-office hits as "In the Line of Fire," "Cliffhanger",  "Philadelphia" and "Sleepless in Seattle".
