The UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva has  contributed to the failure of the international community to prevent mass  slaughter in Rwanda, Amnesty International said Wednesday.
The London-based rights group said the UN commission's special rapporteur  on extrajudicial executions "made 12 detailed recommendations following his  mission to Rwanda in April last year."
Yet one month before the current wave of killings, at its regular meeting  in Geneva, the commission discussed Rwanda but "failed to ensure that the  government implemented these measures", said Amnesty.
The commission "ignored the same expert's warning that lessons should be  drawn from the past and the cycle of violence which has drenched both Burundi  and Rwanda in blood must be broken," said Amnesty.
The UN rights commission was on Wednesday scheduled to appoint a special  rapporteur to investigate the slaughter in Rwanda and recommend ways of ending  the bloodbath, diplomats in Geneva said.
