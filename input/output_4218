Rwandan rebels have rejected French military  participation in a UN force in the country because of its role in training and  arming government troops, a spokesman said in Brussels Thursday.
James Rwego, a spokesman for the Rwanda Patriotic Front, said France could  send humanitarian aid, but not soldiers "because of differences between the  RPF and the French government".
He also said that the RPF accepted the deployment of UN peacekeepers but  only in the context of a "strictly humanitarian" mission.
"There is no question of it playing the part of a buffer force because  this would mean protecting criminals," he said.
"We are calling for international community support to have the massacres  in Rwanda termed a genocide, so that we can judge those responsible,  politicians or military, who called for the killings," he said.
In Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian government Thursday confirmed it was ready  to send troops to take part in the UN force. The foreign ministry did not say  how many troops it planned to send, but sources close to the ministry  suggested these would number 800.
