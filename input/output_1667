Opposition parties fighting Malawi's first free  elections have swept nearly all parliamentary seats in their regional  strongholds, unofficial results from radio reports and other sources indicated  Wednesday.
State radio said the Alliance for Democracy (Aford) had won all 33 seats  in the north.
The United Democratic Front (UDF) had taken almost all the seats in the  south, according to Mike Nambote, a member of the party's task force which is  monitoring the results on radio.
"So far we have won nearly 70 of the 76 seats in the south," Nambote said.
Reports indicated that the ruling Malawi Congress Party of President  Hastings Kamuzu Banda had failed to take all 68 seats in its own stronghold,  the central region, with the UDF having taken 15 so far.
"Indications are that UDF are leading in both presidential and  parliamentary elections and UDF is likely to form the majority in parliament,"  Nambote said.
He said that in the early stage of vote counting Wednesday morning UDF  challenger Bakili Muluzi was leading the presidential race against Banda.
He said Muluzi had 170,000 votes, followed by Banda with 95,000 and  Chakufwa Chihana of Aford with 74,000.
Most of Banda's ministers from the south and north, including  Vice-President Gwanda Chakuamba, have lost their seats.
But John Tembo, influential minister of state who comes from the centre,  has won one of the 177 parliamentary seats.
In the opposition, all presidential running mates have lost, including  Aleke Banda of the UDF and Augustine Mthambala of Aford.
Official results are due Thursday.
