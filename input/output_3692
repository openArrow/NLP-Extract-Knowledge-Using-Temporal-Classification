A Yemeni minister vowed Tuesday that the north would  not attack the southern bastion of Aden with Scud surface-to-surface missiles  to avenge attacks on Sanaa.
"I assure you that this will not happen," Planning Minister Abdel Karim  Iriani told reporters.
A Scud missile attack on the capital on Monday killed at least 15 people  and wounded more than 100, most of them in a hospital, when it crashed near  the presidential palace, officials said.
The south, embroiled in a civil war with the north since May 5, denied  firing the missile.
Iriani acknowledged that the north had fired three missiles with a shorter  range than the Scuds, which were used by Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War, at the  airport of the southern port city of Aden.
One of the missile attacks on Aden killed at least four people.
The north has so far accused forces loyal to Ali Salem al-Baid, who on  Saturday declared an independent state in the south, of firing 22 missiles at  northern cities, including an attack in which 25 people were killed in Sanaa.
The northern and southern armies each had around 30 Russian-made  surface-to-surface missiles before the war broke out, according to Western  military sources in the region.
