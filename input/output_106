Hong Kong's airline Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd.,  will hold another round of talks with disgruntled pilots over pay rises on May  23, an airline spokesman said Friday.
Talks between management and the Aircrew Officers' Association (AOA) ended  Thursday without agreement in a dispute over pay and productivity.
Airline spokesman Phil Burfurd said pilots had been briefed on changes in  service conditions at Thursday's meeting. "We are happy to give a pay rise but  it must be accompanied by increased productivity" to maintain profitability,  he said.
Cathay earlier had offered a five percent pay raise which the pilots  rejected. The AOA represents about 90 percent of Cathay's 1,200 pilots and  flight engineers.
Cathay has already reached agreements with the Flight Attendants Union and  the Local Staff Union, increasing wages by five and eight percent respectively.
A first officer has a starting salary of 21,000 Hong Kong dollars (2,691  US) per month, while senior captains can get as much as 158,000 dollars  (20,256 US) plus housing, education and travel benefits.
Cathay Pacific reported in March its profits had fallen 23.8 percent to  2.293 billion dollars (294 million US) due to inflation in Hong Kong and a  costly flight attendants' strike last year.
