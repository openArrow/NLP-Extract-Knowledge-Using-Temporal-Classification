The English Rugby Union is facing a revolt after  refusing senior clubs representation on its new ruling body.
The top 40 clubs say they are being frozen out in the restructuring of the  union and are threatening a boycott.
They believe that they should have eight seats on the 56-strong council  and two on the 19-man executive.
All they have been offered is two seats on the council, which is not the  policy-making body.
Frank Gibbon, chairman of the Senior Clubs Association, said: "We are  dismayed that what is being offered is fewer than the three seats each being  provided for both students and the services.
"We believe the SCA's relevance is sufficient to justify having two seats  on the RFU executive committee.
"If this cannot be achieved, we will not be prepared to take up the two  council seats."
