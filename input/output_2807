Tabasco Cat, the horse that nearly  cost trainer D. Wayne Lukas' son Jeff his life, gave Lukas his third Preakness  Stakes title Saturday with a victory over Kentucky Derby winner Go for Gin.
Tabasco Cat, ridden by Pat Day, completed the one and three-sixteenths  mile race in one minute, 56 and two-fifths seconds.
He was less than a length in front of Go for Gin, who led much of the race  before Tabasco Cat made his late move.
"He got the jump on me from the eighth pole and was a little better than  me from the eighth pole to the wire," said Go for Gin's jockey Chris McCarron.
Tabasco Cat made headlines in December when he trampled Lukas' son and  partner, Jeff, in a stableyard.
Jeff Lukas suffered severe head injuries in the incident, but has  gradually fought his way back toward health.
Tabasco Cat's victory also helped erase the memory of last year's  Preakness, when the Lukas-trained entry Union City broke down and had to be  destroyed.
On Saturday, Day, who also claimed his third Preakness victory, raced a  perfect duel on the tight Pimlico track.
He had Tabasco Cat fourth with half a mile left, and moved into second at  the quarter-mile mark.
Turning into the stretch, it looked as if Go for Gin might hang on to  claim the second jewel in American racing's Triple Crown.
But Day brought Tabasco Cat up on the outside, and the colt out-raced Go  for Gin to win by three quarters of a length.
Concern, a Maryland-bred stretch-runner, finished third.
