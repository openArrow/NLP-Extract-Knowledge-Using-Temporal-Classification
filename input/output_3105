Hong Kong people emigrating overseas ahead of  the British colony's transfer to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 dropped nearly 20  percent last year to 53,000, a government spokesman said Monday.
The decrease was attributed to the lingering recession in many of the  western countries which emigrants choose to move to and reduced immigration  quotas in destination countries, the spokesman said.
The downturn reversed a rising trend which saw 60,000 leave the territory  in 1991 and a further 66,000 in 1992.
The government expects the number of people emigrating abroad to level out  around 60,000 this year.
Favoured countries for emigration include Canada, Australia, New Zealand,  and the United States.
Official figures show that almost 260,000 Hong Kong-born Chinese have  emigrated abroad since 1984, when a Sino-British pact was signed for the  handover of the British colony.
