US Secretary of State Warren Christopher is to make  an unscheduled visit to Egypt on Wednesday for talks on the Middle East peace  process, the foreign ministry said.
It said Christopher, who was Tuesday in Israel and also visited the  Palestinian self-rule enclave of Jericho, was to make a 24-hour visit to  review the results of his peace mission to the Jewish state and Syria.
A US embassy source said earlier that Christopher was expected in Cairo on  Wednesday for talks with President Hosni Mubarak but he could be delayed until  the next day.
The secretary, who met Egypt's Foreign Minister Amr Mussa on Saturday in  Geneva, has since been on a shuttle between Israel and Syria to try and bring  them back to the negotiating table.
During his last visit to Egypt, the only Arab capital to have signed a  peace treaty with Israel, Christopher witnessed the May 4 signing of the  PLO-Israel accord to launch self-rule in Gaza and Jericho.
