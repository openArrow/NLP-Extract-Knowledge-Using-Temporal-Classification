An angry crowd of demobilised government soldiers  rioted in the streets of Chimoio near the border with Zimbabwe Tuesday, Radio  Mozambique reported.
The soldiers took to the streets to demand the demobilisation pay due to  them in terms of a peace accord which ended 16 years of civil war, the radio  said.
It gave no details of the riot, but said it followed an uprising by  government troops in the Catandica troop assembly area near Chimoio on Sunday.
Three government soldiers were wounded in that incident when the  government's crack "Rapid Intervention Police" put down the riot.
The police intervened when government soldiers from the UN-supervised  assembly area blocked the main road from Chimoio to the northern province of  Tete, demanding immediate demobilisation.
The first of 49 UN-supervised assembly areas were opened last November but  demobilisation began only in March while hundreds of soldiers still endure  rudimentary conditions in the camps with growing impatience.
Government sources said an inquiry had been launched into the Catandica  affair.
But observers of Mozambique's troubled peace process say the most worrying  issue is the problem of non-payment of demob' compensation.
They say demobilised soldiers are potentially one of the biggest threats  to stability in post-war Mozambique, which is due to hold multiparty elections  in October in terms of a peace agreement between the government and the  Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO).
