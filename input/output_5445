The 6'2" (1.88m) Dreekmann is built like Becker but there the resemblance  ends. Unlike Becker, Stich and Goellner, the latest German star is happier  rallying from the baseline than charging to the net.
"I have been playing on clay since I was seven years old," he explains.
The key to his victory over the experienced Krickstein was his intelligent  changes of pace and clever drop shots but he is not about to boast about his  tactical sense.
"It just comes out," he said. "I try something and if that works I keep  doing it. If it doesn't, I change."
Krickstein was more forthcoming. "He looks very noncholant out there. But  he has got a pretty good disguise on his forehand and he is capable of hitting  some big shots.
"He doesn't look like a great player but he is young and in the quarter  finals of a grand slam, so he must be doing something right."
Despite his surprise at having come so far so soon, Dreekmann never  doubted that he would make it to the top.
"I've always thought I was good enough," he says in response to questions  about the business studies he is trying to combine with a life on the tour.
"I still want to qualify but if I'm doing this well I don't know if I'll  be able to keep up my studies."
