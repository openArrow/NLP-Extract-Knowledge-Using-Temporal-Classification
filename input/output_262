Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa agreed  Friday with US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor to resume stalled framework  trade talks between their two countries, officials said.
The agreement was reached when the two ministers talked by telephone for  about 20 minutes, the Japanese officials said.
"The two countries should have contacts as soon as possible," Kakizawa was  quoted as saying. Kantor agreed with the Japanese foreign minister.
News reports said here that Japan and the United States were expected to  hold subcabinet-level talks next week in Washington to discuss bilateral trade.
Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice minister for international affairs at the  International Trade and Industry Ministry, and Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy  foreign minister for economic affairs, are expected to represent Japan at the  meeting, the reports said.
Framework talks, mainly designed to cut Japan's chronic huge trade surplus  with the United States, have been suspended since February.
In February in Washington, then Japanese prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa  told US President Bill Clinton that Japan could not accept US demands to set  numerical targets in cutting its trade surplus.
Hosokawa said that such targets would undermine the free trade system and  lead to managed trade.
