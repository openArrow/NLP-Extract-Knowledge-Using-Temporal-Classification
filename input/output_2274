Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who fought to live a  normal life despite being the widow of a glamorous president and Greek  shipping magnate, died Thursday of cancer at 10:15 p.m. (0215 GMT), according  to a statement from a family friend Nancy Tuckerman.
Her daughter Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg and son John F. Kennedy, Jr.,  were with her when she died, along with a longtime friend Maurice Tempelsman.
The former first lady died at her apartment in New York after losing a  battle with non-Hodgkin's (eds: correct) lymphoma. She was 64 years old.
