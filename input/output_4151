South Africa should return to the Commonweralth  before the end of this month, Commonwealth Secretary General Emeka Anyaoku  announced Thursday.
Chief Anyaoku said South African President Nelson Mandela had officially  asked for his country's speedy return to the body, made up of Britain and its  former colonies.
South Africa was forced out of the Commonwealth in 1961.
"I am contacting all the Commonwealth heads of government immediately and  expect to be able to announce South Africa's formal return to the Commonwealth  by the end of the month," Anyaoku said.
At the last Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, in Cyprus last  October, the 50 Commonwealth nations agreed that South Africa would be  welcomed back as soon as its government had become democratic and non-racial.
South Africa was admitted Monday to the Organisation of African Unity.
