Police probing the serial killing of seven  backpackers, five of them foreign tourists, charged a man with armed hold-up  and firearm offences Sunday after dawn raids in the Sydney area.
The biggest murder hunt in Australia's history started after the bodies of  the backpackers, three Germans, two Britons and two Australians were found in  a remote forest south of here between September 1992 and November 1993.
A police spokesman said detectives had arrested and charged a 49-year-old  man with armed hold-up and using a firearm on January 25 1990 and that the man  -- who was not named -- would appear in court Monday.
Another man, aged 42, was charged with firearm and drug offences and a  38-year-old man with firearm, drug and deception offences said the spokesman  who made no direct reference in the statement to the serial killings.
The 49-year-old man was refused bail, but the other two were granted bail  and are to appear in court on June 26.
Police from Task Force Air -- set up to probe the killings -- searched  nine homes in the Sydney area around dawn including a house in the  southwestern suburb of Eagle Vale, a police spokesman said.
A rifle and a sword were among items taken from the homes by police.
The seven bodies were found buried in the Belanglo state forest near  Bowral 120 kilometres (75 miles) south of here at four separate sites between  September 1992 and November 1993.
The bodies of two 22-year-old British women Caroline Clark and Joanne  Walters, were found in September 1992. In October 1993, the remains of  Australian backpackers James Gibson and Deborah Everist were found nearby.
The remains of 20-year-old German Simone Schmidl were found on November 1,  1993, and the bodies of Gabor Neugebauer and his German girlfriend, Anja  Habschied, were found on November 4.
Authories had offered a reward of 500,000 Australian dollars (350,000 US)  for information leading to the arrest of the killer.
Sunday's breakthrough in the investigation was helped by information from a  24-year-old Englishwoman about an incident which occurred in January 1990 when  she was visiting Australia, police said.
