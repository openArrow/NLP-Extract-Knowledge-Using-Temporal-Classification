Massud Barzani, head of the Kurdistan Democratic  Party, Friday appealed for a ceasefire between his forces and the Patriotic  Union of Kurdistan in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq.
"I appeal to all the parties to stop the war and end the Kurdish  bloodshed," Barzani said in a statement received by AFP in Ankara Friday.
The Patriotic Union, led by Jalal Talabani, and the Democratic Party have  both rejected responsiblity for the outbreak of fighting Wednesday and  Thursday which broke a ceasefire agreement signed May 8.
Northern Iraq has been under the control of the two movements since an  uprising against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's army at the end of the Gulf  War in February 1991.
Officials from the Iraqi National Congress, a coalition said to represent  all Kurdish and Arab groups opposed to the Iraqi leader, Thursday accused the  Patriotic Union of breaching the previous ceasefire agreement.
Barzani called for joint efforts with the Iraqi National Congress to  normalise the relationship.
The May 8 agreement, brokered by the Iraqi National Congress, came after  two weeks of fighting in which at least 100 people were killed.
