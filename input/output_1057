Italy's new prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi,  has been invited to visit London for a meeting with British Prime Minister  John Major, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said here Monday.
He was speaking during a meeting of EU foreign ministers -- the first  attended by Italy's new foreign minister, Antonio Martino.
Hurd said he had an "extremely cordial" talk with Martino, who accepted an  invitation for Berlusconi to visit London at a date yet to be set.
"I believe we ought to establish such a summit as quickly as possible,"  the British foreign minister said.
He added that his meeting with Martino "held good promise" for maintaining  Britain's fruitful relations with Italy, particularly in such areas as defence  and relations with eastern Europe.
Asked whether he felt uneasy at dealing with Berlusconi's coalition  government, which includes neo-fascists, Hurd said: "We have no reserves about  working with it."
He added: "The new Italian government is a three-party coalition. I see no  difficulty whatever in continuing close cooperation between Britain and Italy."
