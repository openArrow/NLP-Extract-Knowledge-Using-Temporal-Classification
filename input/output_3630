Russia signalled here Tuesday that it would sign  NATO's partnership-for-peace initiative only if at the same time it is also  given a separate accord on closer Russia-NATO relations.
Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said he or Russian Foreign Minister  Andrei Kozyrev intended to travel to NATO headquarters here at an undetermined  date to sign both documents at once.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has been pressing Russia to join  the partnership-for-peace (PFP) programme of military cooperation between NATO  and former communist countries.
But Moscow has indicated it will sign the partnership programme only if  NATO agrees to a parallel accord of political cooperation between Russia and  the western alliance.
Grachev said he would be presenting Russia's proposals for the  partnership, plus "concept" proposals for a bilateral relationship, to NATO  here Wednesday.
"In principle we are ready to sign (the partnership) even if it is not a  Russian initiative," he said, but suggested strongly that Moscow would not  accept the PFP without the separate bilateral accord.
Grachev was speaking ahead of a meeting with the NATO defence ministers to  present Russia's long-awaited new military doctrine to replace the security  blueprint of the defunct Soviet Union.
NATO has said it is particularly anxious to find out how Russia intends to  treat its "near abroad" -- other republics of the former Soviet Union with  Russian minorities.
