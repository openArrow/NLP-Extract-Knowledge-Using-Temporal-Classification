Trading in the shares of the US food and tobacco  giant Philip Morris was suspended on the foreign section of the Tokyo Stock  Exchange (TSE) Thursday.
TSE officials said the move followed a similar action taken by the New  York Stock Exchange overnight on reports that Philip Morris planned to  separate its food and tobacco businesses.
