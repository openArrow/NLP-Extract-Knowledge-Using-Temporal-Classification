Yemen's oil sector, its only way out of poverty,  could become the latest victim of the civil war as northern troops appear to  set their sights on major fields in their push south.
But oil analysts in the region believe a disruption of Yemen's crude  supplies would not have a major impact on the oil market given its relatively  small exports and lower world demand in the second and third quarters.
"A loss of around 250,000 barrels per day will not jolt a market already  awash with crude," an expert said. "Even if the market felt the loss, it could  be more than offset by neighbouring Gulf oil-producers."
In some of the latest fighting, northern troops loyal to President Ali  Abdallah Saleh have said they were pushing to capture the southern province of  Shabwa, where Yemen's main oilfields are located.
Diplomats said a confrontation in the area, 300 kilometres (185 miles)  northeast of Aden, could damage oil facilities and disrupt crude exports as  most of them come from Shabwa.
"I don't think capturing the oilfields is easy. It could be very costly  for Yemen as the fields would not be spared in the fighting," one diplomat  said.
Western sources in the southern port city of Aden said Monday that the  Canadian firm Canoxy, which has been operating in Yemen for five years, had  suspended operations in Masila.
They said tankers had stopped loading from the southeastern Mukalla  terminal, where the Masila crude arrives by pipeline, because of higher  insurance premiums.
However, Yemen's oil facilities in the south have not been damaged by the  fighting, the sources said.
According to independent industry estimates, the Shabwa and Masila fields  produce around 140,000 barrels per day (bpd), accounting for almost all crude  output in the south.
Another 195,000 bpd come from Mareb fields in the north.
Yemen's oil exports have steadily grown over the past years as the country  at the tip of Arabian Peninsula pressed ahead with exploration and development  of its fields.
From an average 100,000 bpd in 1988, oil exports increased to 130,000 bpd  in 1992 and 170,000 bpd in 1993.
Before the civil war erupted on May 5, they were projected to exceed  250,000 bpd in 1994 as the French Total and other international oil companies  embarked on plans to develop their fields.
"Such plans mean oil production could exceed 400,000 bpd in 1994 and  500,000 bpd in 1995," a Gulf-based oil executive said. "But this will not be  possible if the war spreads to the oil areas. On the contrary."
Yemen's crude reserves are estimated at four billion barrels but the     figure is expected to rise as the more than 20 Arab and foreign companies  operating in both sectors have not yet covered all areas.
Major discoveries have also boosted Yemen's gas reserves from 198 billion  cubic metres (6.6 trillion cubic feet) in 1990 to 362 billion cubic metres    (12 trillion cubic feet) in 1993, according to official Arab figures.
After the north and south merged in May 1990, their leaders promised to  use the growing oil wealth to raise living standards and tackle economic  problems caused by a debt of around 6.5 billion dollars, high inflation rates  and unemployment, slow growth and deficits in the budget and balance of  payments.
"Oil is Yemen's only hope for the time being to ease its economic  difficulties," a Gulf-based Arab diplomat said.
"Yemen is not like Kuwait, which had massive investments abroad" during  the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis, he said. "Damage to its oil sector would mean  serious economic deterioration, and recovery could become more remote."
