Japan's consumer prices in April edged up 0.2  percent from the previous month and 0.8 percent from a year earlier, the state  management and coordination agency said Friday.
The agency said that consumer prices in Tokyo alone, a leading indicator  of nationwide inflation, also rose 0.2 percent in May from April and 0.6  percent from a year earlier.
Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii told a press conference, "I got the  impression that prices remain low both in Tokyo and across the nation."
The nationwide index of consumer prices stood at 107.3 against the base  figure of 100 for the year 1990 while the Tokyo index came to 107.5, the  agency said.
