A fire that broke out overnight in a  hostel whose residents included foreigners killed three people and left one  person missing, police said Saturday.
But police said that it was unlikely that the fire was racially motivated.  Up to 20 people lived in the hostel, but none were seeking asylum.
Police did not know the cause of the fire which destroyed the three-storey  building.
Damage was estimated at some 300,000 German marks (182,000 dollars).
