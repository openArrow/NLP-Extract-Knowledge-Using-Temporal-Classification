The rally in blue-chip stocks continued Thursday,  led by a rise in technology stocks as the bond market shrugged off an early  slump.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 26.09 points percent, its sixth  consecutive rise, to close at 3.758.98.
On the broader market, rising shares outnumbered decliners 1,296 to 860  with 658 stocks unchanged. Trading was active with some 303 million shares  exchanged.
"I think there is some real buying out here. The market is giving a  marvelous account of itself," said Bob Kahan of Montgomery Securities.
The blue-chip index was lower in early trading as a result of  profit-taking and a temporary climb in long-term interest rates after the  release of a report showing a dramatic decline in the US trade deficit in  March.
But the bond market later rallied, with the yield on 30-year Treasury  bonds falling to 7.23 percent from 7.27 percent Wednesday, following a brief  rise to 7.30 percent.
General Instrument led high-tech gains, rising 4-1/4 to 59-1/8 after an  announcement that it had been chosen along with ATT to provide 11 billion  dollars worth of interactive-service equipment to Bell Atlantic.
ATT gained 1-1/2 to close at 56-3/4 and Bell Atlantic 1/8 to close at  53-7/8.
Banks lost ground in profit-taking. Chase Manhattan fell 3/8 to close at  36-3/4 and Bankamerica 1/2 to 48-1/2.
