New Zealand were summoned to an extra net  practice by coach Geoff Howarth after crashing to defeat by an innings and 33  runs against Yorkshire on Thursday.
The tourists resumed on the third morning needing another 137 to make  Yorkshire bat again, but never looked remotely liked doing so once opener  Blair Hartland had fallen to Peter Hartley without addition to his overnight  60.
Captain Ken Rutherford fell soon afterwards, caught at long leg hooking at  Mark Robinson and although left-hander Stephen Fleming hit a six and six  boundaries in a bright 40 made from 43 deliveries, the contest was over once  he had spooned a return catch to off-spinner Michael Vaughan.
With Martin Crowe taken to his bed ill, New Zealand's innings folded  tamely.
Left-hander Mark Greatbatch continued his dismal form on the tour, making  just 12 in 74 minutes.
Yorkshire all-rounder Craig White, who hit a dashing 59 in his county's  first innings, took two for 30 with his lively medium-pacers in New Zealand's  second innings to finish with seven wickets in the match.
White, 24, was watched closely by England chairman of selectors Ray  Illingworth and he has emerged as a real possibility for the first Test at  Nottingham next week.
