Honda's uncompetitive Indy-car  engine suffered a humiliating fate Saturday, being secretly withdrawn from the  Indianapolis 500.
Bobby Rahal and Mike Groff, who had qualified the Honda-powered cars,  safely requalified in faster backup cars for the May 29 race thanks to help  from rivals Roger Penske and enginemaker Ilmor.
The next-to-last session of time trials featured Rahal and Groff telling  reporters they waited until after the Honda cars were bumped from the field  before requalifying in cars purchased from Roger Penske using Ilmor engines.
But track officials later said the slower Hondas were withdrawn from the  33-car lineup before they were knocked out by faster cars.
"This is a strange place," Rahal said. "We had some hard choices. We had  to balance what was right. Somebody was going to be disappointed. There is an  obligation to the team, even before the sponsors."
The busy and bizarre session ended with Rahal, Groff and Brazilian rookie  Mauricio Gugelmin withdrawing and requalifying in faster backup cars. Canada's  Scott Goodyear and US drivers Davy Jones and John Paul also qualified  Saturday, while rookie Mark Smith made the field but was bumped out.
Goodyear is the slowest qualifier, or "man on the bubble," entering the  final day of time trials on the 2.5-mile (4km) oval. Drivers can qualify only  by surpassing the four-lap speed of the slowest qualified driver, who is  bumped out of the starting lineup. Goodyear's target speed is 220.737 mph  (353.179 km/h).
"We feel pretty confident it's going to be all right," Goodyear said.
Goodyear qualified his Cosworth-powered Lola at 220.737 mph (353.179  km/h). Goodyear had waved off a faster qualifying run last weekend and then  crashed at the entrance to pit row. His crew spent the past week repairing the  car.
