A UN military observer killed at the edge of the  Sarajevo exclusion zone was a Malaysian, UN forces spokesman Eric Chaperon  said Friday, adding that the shell which hit his vehicle was "not an accident."
Another UN observer injured in the same incident Thursday was an Egyptian  but his life was not in danger, Major Chaperon said.
He identified the dead observer as Major Ariffin Zakaria. He said his body  was to be flown to Kuala Lumpur Friday and a brief military ceremony would be  held in his honor at Sarajevo airport.
He said the Egyptian was Lieutenant Colonel Mohamed Kamal El Din, who  suffered shrapnel wounds to his legs and was evacuated by helicopter to a  Canadian medical unit in Visoko, northwest of Sarajevo.
The UN military spokesman said a single shell was fired on their vehicle  after it got stuck in mud at Cermenica, 15 kilometers (eight miles) northeast  of Visoko.
"It is not an accident of firing," he stressed.
But he refused to say whether the shell had been fired by Bosnian Serb  forces who have a position only a kilometer (less than a mile) from where the  observers' truck got bogged down.
The two UN soldiers had called for assistance.
The spokesman said a Bosnian army soldier was also wounded when he and a  colleague on board a tractor came under fire as they were trying to tow away  the UN vehicle.
He said the Bosnian soldier had been hit in the back, but was out of  danger.
