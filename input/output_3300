The commandos who abducted a pro-Iranian Shiite  Moslem guerrilla leader from Lebanon to trace a missing airman also returned  to Israel with "important documents," the defence ministry said Monday.
"The commandos brought back important documents found in the home of  Dirani," spokesman Oded Ben Ami told AFP, declining to give details.
Israeli newspapers said the raid on Mustafa Dirani's home uncovered a list  of names and addresses, as well as a video tape proving that airman Ron Arad  had been handed over by Dirani to other pro-Iranian elements in Lebanon.
In Lebanon, Foreign Minister Fares Bweiz condemned Dirani's abduction  Sunday from the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley as a blow to the Middle East  peace process.
Israel said its helicopter-borne commandos kidnapped Dirani to obtain  information on the fate of Arad, who was captured in Lebanon in 1986 and  believed to be still alive.
In his home village of Qsarnabaa, from where he was abducted, another  leader of his pro-Iranian group, the Resistance of the Faithful, told  reporters that Dirani had no information on Arad.
Since Dirani left the Syrian-backed group Amal in 1988, "he has had no  further involvement in this affair and has absolutely no information on this  subject," insisted Zakariya Hamzeh.
Hamzeh also issued a threat of revenge against Israel. The Resistance of  the Faithful "will not allow Israel to laugh for long," Hamzeh warned, without  elaborating.
Dirani was head of intelligence for Amal when it captured Arad. He left  the secular group and set up the Resistance of the Faithful.
