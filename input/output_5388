The buzz of Dakotas filled the night air at 10 minutes to one and American  paratroopers from the 82nd and 101st airborne divisions under the command of  Generals Matthew Ridgway and Maxwell Taylor began drifting down towards the  village of Sainte-Mere-Eglise behind Utah beach, the name given to Cotentin.
Almost simultaneously, British aircraft dropped the 6th division,  commanded by General Richard Gale, between the villages of Ornes and Dives.
Landing was something of a lottery. Several paratroopers drowned in the  Dives and Le Merderet marshes.
Some 20 Americans landed in the village square at Sainte-Mere-Eglise as a  warning bell tolled. One of them, a soldier named Steele, spent the night  hanging from the steeple by his parachute harness, feigning death.
Regrouping was nothing short of miraculous. Up until 2:30 a.m., successive  waves of paratroopers and gliders formed up into American and English  divisions.
Skirmishes broke out with some of the German troops, many of them central  European mercenaries.
Ridgway set up his command post in an orchard, recalling later that the  Germans were all around and could easily have wiped out the bridgehead if they  had mounted a concerted counter-attack.
South of Cotentin on the banks of the Orne and the Caen canal, 23,000 men  took six hours to secure the approaches to the beachheads.
The first Allied soldier to die at the hands of the Germans was Corporal  Bouetard, a Brittany-born Frenchman who was among the 400 paratroopers of  Major Pierre Bourgoin's "sky battalion" come to liberate their homeland.
