Vietnamese border police have freed 61 people,  including 31 children, sold into slavery for just 20 dollars to work for gold  miners in the centre of the country, a report said Monday.
Five people were arrested for luring people from Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh  City with the promises of work and then selling them to work in private gold  mines along the Vietnamese border with Laos, the Tuoi Tre newspaper reported.
The workers were sold for just 200,000 dong (20 dollars) and were forced  to work without pay and in "the most penurious conditions," the newspaper said.
Some had tried to flee from the mines but were caught and "beaten  mercilessly," it said.
Border police arrested five members of a gang selling people and  confiscated weapons after raiding the mines on May 10.
