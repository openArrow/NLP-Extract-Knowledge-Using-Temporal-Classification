Total new car sales around the world will rise by  five percent in 1994 to 35 million, and rise to 43 million by 1999, analysts  at British research group DRI McGraw-Hill said in a report published Monday.
The world new car market, which fell to a six-year low in 1993, will  recover in 1994 thanks to growth in the United States and a lesser recovery in  a number of Asian and European markets, the report said.
From then on, the climb in sales will be mainly led by the new markets in  South Korea, Thailand, China, Latin America and Eastern Europe, the report  added.
The Japanese market is expected to rise by five percent in 1995, to 4.4  million cars, after a stable year in 1994.
The west European market will grow by three percent in 1994 and by six  percent in 1995, reaching 12.5 million new car sales, thanks to a recovery in  Britain and France.
In Britain the report predicts new car sales of two million in 1994 and  2.3 million in 1997, adding that the European upturn will be boosted by  stronger sales in France and Spain, where sales will rise thanks to government  support.
After falling by 18 percent last year, the French market should rise from  1.9 million cars this year to two million in 1995 and 2.4 million by the end  of the decade.
However, the German market will fall three percent this year to 3.1  million, not returning to the 1992 peak of 4.2 million before the year 2000.
Italy is expected to see a fall of six percent in the number of new cars  sold, down to 1.8 million in 1994, before a recovery to 1.9 million in 1995  and 2.1 million the following year.
