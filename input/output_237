The dollar firmed against other major currencies  in quiet trading here early Friday after the government reported an  unexpectedly small rise in April consumer prices and because of a long holiday  weekend in Europe.
Gold, meanwhile, rose to 381 dollars an ounce, up 1.10 dollars from late  Thursday.
The dollar jumped to 1.6730 German marks just after the announcement that  consumer prices rose a modest 0.1 percent in April, much lower than the 0.3  percent advance many analysts had expected, and then fell back slightly.
At about 9:45 a.m. (1250 GMT), the greenback traded at 1.6705 German  marks, up from 1.6675 late Thursday. It stood at 1.6730 marks an hour earlier  in London.
Against the yen, the dollar stood at 104.85, up from 104.22 late Thursday.  In London, it had climbed to 105.35 yen after the announcement that  US-Japanese trade talks would resume in Washington next week.
The US currency also firmed against other major European currencies,  rising to 5.7288 French francs from 5.7200 late Thursday, to 1.4277 Swiss  francs (1.4245) and to 0.6673 pound sterling (0.6669).
A trader with a major European bank in New York predicted the dollar would  move between 1.6650 and 1.6750 marks for the rest of the day.
Traders were cautiously awaiting the Federal Reserve's next meeting of its  policy-setting Open Market Committee, on Tuesday. Analysts expect the Fed will  raise the federal funds rate, the interest charged on overnight interbank  loans.
