The largest US cable TV company,  TCI, and the leading Japanese cable company, Sumitomo, said Tuesday they were  forming two joint ventures for the Japanese markets.
The first company will hold Sumitomo's cable assets and develop and  acquire new cable systems in anticipation that the Japanese government will  allow cable operators to provide telephone service over their networks.
TCI and Sumitomo are expected to invite telephone companies to join them  in the cable-telephone venture.
The second venture will be a programming company that will develop  services for cable distribution in Japan and hold Sumitomo's and TCI's  interests in the cable service movie channel, Cable Soft Network, and in the  proposed Japanese Home Shopping Network.
Equity stakes will be set initially at 67 percent for Sumitomo and 33  percent for TCI, which could increase its share to 40 percent when Japanese  regulations permit.
The two companies developed a high-tech fiber optic cable system in a  Tokyo suburb last year.
TCI has 10 million subscribers in the United States and also operates in  Britain with US West. Sumitomo has 132,000 subscribers out of 2.5 potential  clients in Japan's underdeveloped cable market.
