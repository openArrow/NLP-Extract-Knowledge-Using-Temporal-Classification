China-backed Guangdong Enterprises (Holdings)  Ltd. and US-based construction firm Bechtel Group Inc. Thursday signed a 50-50  joint venture to finance and build a new 400 million dollar tollway in  Shenzhen.
GD/BE Development Group Ltd. will hold 40 percent equity in the tollway,  with the remaining 60 percent owned by the Shenzhen municipal and Guangdong  provincial highway companies.
The agreement was signed here between Guangdong Investment Development  (Shenzhen) Co. Ltd, wholly-owned by Guangdong Enterprises (Holdings) Ltd., and  Bechtel Enterprises Inc., wholly-owned by Bechtel Group Inc.
When completed, the six-lane toll road will be the first major east-west  highway serving the Shenzhen city area north of the special economic zone.
The 47-kilometer (29-mile) highway will also extend from Huangtian to Heao  and intersect with a superhighway to Guangzhou and the Shenzhen airport and  four other north-south highways -- two of which have been completed and a  third is under construction.
The project will partially link the major industrial areas in China's  Zhejiang and Fujian provinces as well as the Pearl River Delta, thus  significantly reduce travel time and congestion.
No date has been set for start of construction.
