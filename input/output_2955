Kenyan world champion Ismael Kirui won the 5,000  metre road race in Aberdeen on Sunday.
But he was pushed all the way by Englishman Rob Denmark, who had finished  eight places behind him in Stuttgart.
Denmark retrieved a 15-metre, mid-race deficit on Kirui, before losing a  sprint finish by a few strides, with both men timed at 13mins 37secs.
Denmark, delighted by his start to the season, later paid tribute to the  victor, saying: "Kirui is the best in the world, and in superb form."
However, the Essex runner delivered a blow to Britain's chances of  regaining the European Cup in Birmingham next month, hinting the European  Championships and Commonwealth games might take precedence.
He said: "To do every event would be taking on too much. I'm not saying I  definitely won't run in Birmingham, but I need to talk to the authorities."
Great Britain's Kevin McKay won the mile in 4:06, ahead of Kenyan Benson  Koech, with Steve Cram fourth.
Afterwards, Englishman Cram had a dig back at rival Matthew Yates, who  insisted last week the former mile world record holder should start shaping up  or get out of big-time athletics.
Cram said: "He would be better doing his talking on the track.
"I have no problems racing against him. I still feel I have something to  offer."
Yates pulled out of the race with a stomach bug.
Scotland's defending 5,000 metre champion Yvonne Murray was outpaced in  the final 200 metres by Ireland's Sonia O'Sullivan.
World 1,500 Metre silver medalist O'Sullivan was a late replacement for  the injured Scot Liz McColgan, and the race suffered another casualty when  Zola Pieterse dropped out feeling unwell nearing 3,000 metres.
