Israel freed 78 Palestinian  prisoners on Monday in line with an agreement which launched self-rule in the  Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho this month, a Palestinian police  official said.
The Gazans were released from the Ketziot army prison camp in the Negev  desert of southern Israeli, said the official.
The police had been told by the army to fetch them from the Nahal Oz  crossing point into the Gaza Strip, he added.
"We will take them by buses to Gaza stadium for a ceremony where they will  be re-united with their families," the official told AFP.
"If the situation stays the same, the army will free about 100 Gaza  prisoners every Monday and Friday."
An army spokesman said six buses had left Ketziot for Gaza, but refused to  say how many prisoners were on board.
A total of 1,579 Palestinians were released on May 4 and 5, but Israel  then halted the process without any explanation.
Under the May 4 accord, Israel has until June 8 to release 5,000  prisoners. Negotiations were to continue on the fate of the remaining  Palestinians in Israeli jails.
However, the inmates have to sign a pledge to "abstain from all acts of  terrorism and violence" and to support the accord. About 700 have refused to  sign and remain in jail.
