Patrick Ewing's worst performance  since his first high school game helped show the New York Knicks how far they  must rise to win the National Basketball Association title.
Ewing managed only one point here Saturday and the Knicks set an NBA  playoff record for scoring futility in an 88-68 loss to Indiana in a  semi-final game. New York leads the best-of-seven series 2-1 with game four  here Monday.
"This was an ugly loss," New York guard John Starks said. "It was a  frustrating feeling."
Ewing, a member of the 1992 Olympic "Dream Team," endured a nightmare by  missing all 10 of his shots from the field. His only point came on a free  throw with 6:39 to play, his lowest-scoring game since his debut for Rindge  Latin High School 16 years ago.
"All I remember is I scored one point and fouled out," Ewing said. "It was  a long, long time ago."
The Knicks' point total was the lowest in any NBA playoff game since a  shot clock was created 40 years ago. The previous low of 69 was set by Indiana  in game two of their quarter-final series against Atlanta earlier this month.
"For us to win the championship, there's going to be a hard road," Ewing  said. "Maybe this will be our worst moment. There will be days like this,  hopefully not too many. I have to deal with it and learn from it."
Even Indiana coach Larry Brown was astonished at how effective his  double-team defense was against Ewing, who averaged 30 points in the first two  games against the Pacers.
"I didn't think he would go 10-for-10 but I never thought I would coach a  game where he scored only one point," Brown said.
