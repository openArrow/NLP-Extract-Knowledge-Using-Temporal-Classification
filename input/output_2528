Norway coach Egil Olsen has made an astonishing  attack on the tactics that have brought England victory in their first two  games under Terry Venables.
As he prepared his team for their World Cup warm-up against Venables'  reborn Englishmen, Olsen told Sunday's opponents they should revert to the  'long-ball' game favoured by their failed previous boss Graham Taylor.
Venables, a long-time exponent of the continental close-passing style, got  off to a highly-promising start with a 1-0 win over Denmark in March and a 5-0  hammering of Greece on Tuesday.
But Olsen says England should take their lead from "black sheep" club  Wimbledon, whose no frills approach has taken them to the top six in the  Premiership on a Second Division budget.
Olsen said: "I have a lot of respect for Venables and what he has done.  But I don't agree with that style of play. All the research done on how goals  are scored shows that that style of play is not effective.
"We don't try to play exactly the same way as Wimbledon, and I know the  name of Wimbledon has a bad sound in England. But you can't ignore their  results.
"They have a very difficult system to play against. Look at how their  goals are scored -- from set-plays or from knockdowns.
"If you play long balls when the opponent is unbalanced, you avoid the  problem of losing the ball in midfield.
"I personally think even Brazil and Argentina should play like that.
"England were an exponent of this style, but now it does not exist,  because teams in the Premier League play differently.
"Some are even using a sweeper. I think this is a backwards step."
