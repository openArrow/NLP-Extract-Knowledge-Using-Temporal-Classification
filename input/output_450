Some 77 civilian casualties were reported by  hospital staff here Saturday after nearly two hours of heavy weapons fire  traded by rival Afghan factions battling for and against President Burhanuddin  Rabbani.
According to a defence ministry official there was no infantry offensive  by the coalition rival forces of Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Uzbek  General Abdul Rashid Dostam during the bombardment late Friday.
However, pro-Rabbani troops on the frontline in the old city based close  to Dostam's Bala Hissar fortress said they came under strong attack by Uzbek  frontline troops.
These particular pro-Rabbani troops, stationed in the otherwise deserted  ruins of Shor Bazaar receive the brunt of rival faction military pressure  because close quarters fighting is a daily occurance here even when it is  quiet elsewhere on the frontlines.
Kabul was notably quiet Saturday with no reported incidents on the  frontlines apart from the usual minor skirmishing, and the heavy weapons of  both sides also remained still.
Fighting continues in the provinces 200 kilometres (120 miles) north of  Kabul around Baghlan and Pul-i-Khumri centres which are under siege by  Rabbani's strongman ex-defence minister Ahmad Shah Masood.
"There is no change in the general military situation there," a defence  ministry official said.
Despite earlier defence ministry claims that the old city of Baghlan had  been captured by Masood's men a week ago it seems all of Baghlan is still in  the hands of Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami faction and their Uzbek and Ismaelia  religious sect allies.
Defence ministry officials are adamant, however, that Kunduz -- which fell  briefly to Dostam in February -- and all surrounding districts are totally in  the hands of pro-Rabbani forces.
