Officials from seven countries will meet this  week in Washington to discuss the peace process in Bosnia-Hercegovina, the  White House said Tuesday.
The seven countries, which last week in Geneva adopted a declaration on a  peace plan for Bosnia, will meet Thursday and Friday, said White House  spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers.
Represented will be the United States, Germany, France, Britain, Russia,  Greece and Belgium. They adopted a joint declaration calling for a four-month  ceasefire and 51 percent of Bosnian territory to be given to a Moslem-Croat  federation, with 49 percent going to the country's ethnic Serbs.
Myers did not indicate the level of the talks but said the discussions  would be aimed at finding "ways to kep the peace process going."
