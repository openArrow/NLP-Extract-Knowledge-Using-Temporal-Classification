Rwanda is facing an outbreak of epidemics as the  civil war in the country enters its seventh week, the World Health  Organization said Thursday.
WHO director general Hiroshi Nakajima said he was "gravely preoccupied by  the rapid deterioration of the health situation in Rwanda" and warned of the  likelihood of major outbreaks of cholera, dysentery and other communicable  diseases.
He urged belligerants in the African country to agree to inspections to  evaluate the medical needs.
Medical personnel must be mobilized urgently to deal as effectively and  speedily as possible with the public health needs, he said.
Corpses floating in Rwandan rivers or found near water holes were a  serious threat to public health, he added.
WHO aides in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire are to  hold a meeting in Nairobi Monday to coordinate health assistance to the  war-torn country.
Inter-ethnic strife is believed to have claimed as many as 500,000 lives  in six weeks of fighting between the minority Tutsis and majority Hutus.
The mainly Tutsi rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) refuse to  recognise the government, which was formed after the death of president  Juvenal Habyarimana in a mysterious plane crash on April 6.
Most of those slaughtered have been Tutsis or moderate Hutus opposed to  Hutu hardliners.
