Israel officially  handed over the autonomous Jericho enclave to the Palestinian police on Friday  with a handshake between two generals.
Journalists watched as Israel's central region military commander General  Ilan Biran (eds. correct) grasped the hand of Palestine Liberation Army  General Hajj Ismail to mark the transfer of power.
The ceremony took place by the Allenby Bridge which links Jordan with the  West Bank after 386 Palestinian police crossed the River Jordan.
"I wish you good luck," Biran said.
"Thank you," Ismail replied. "I hope we will be successful together on the  road to peace."
Palestinian youths shouted "Allah u Akbar" (God is great) and pro-PLO  slogans.
"There are now 462 Palestinian policemen in Jericho," Ismail said.
A first group of officers arrived Thursday followed by about 40 more  overnight. Before dawn they took over a series of official buildings ranging  from the police station to the post office .
