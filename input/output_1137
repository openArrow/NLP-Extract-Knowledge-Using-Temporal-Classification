Wang Dan, a leading Chinese dissident, was  arrested Tuesday by police at his residence in the capital while being  interviewed by journalists, members of his family said.
Wang, a prominent student leader during 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations,  was taken from the residence by about 10 police officers, they said, adding  that no reason was given for his arrest.
"The police told the journalists to leave the appartment since they did  not have official authorization to interview Wang Dan," a family member told  AFP by telephone.
