South Africa's monthly trade surplus dropped 35  percent in April to 1.657 billion rand (460 million dollars) from 2.556  billion rand (710 million dollars) in March, according to official figures  released here by the Department of Customs and Excise Tuesday.
Exports fell 19 percent to 6.69 billion rand (1.99 billion dollars),  outstripping a 12 percent fall in imports to 5.03 billion rand (1.39 billion  dollars).
The cumulative surplus for the first four months of the year was 6.37  billion rand (1.8 billion dollars), 17 percent up on the 5.4 billion rand (1.5  billion dollars) recorded in the same period last year.
Economists blamed a spate of public holidays in April, linked to South  Africa's historic first all-race elections from April 26-29, for the slump.
