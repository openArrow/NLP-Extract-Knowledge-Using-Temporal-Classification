North Korean President Kim Il-Sung has said the  nuclear issue must be resolved through dialogue with the United States, the  Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported Friday.
"Since the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula has emanated from the  United States' hostile policy towards the DPRK (North Korea), it must be  resolved through dialogue between us and the United States," he was quoted by  KCNA as saying in a report monitored here.
The leader of the Stalinist state added: "We feel no need to develop  nuclear weapons and, even if were were to manufacture one or two of them, they  would be useless."
But he warned that North Korea would not bow to international pressure  over its nuclear ambitions, saying that "pressure can never be a solution to  the problem."
"If the United States continues to clamour to put pressure on our  republic, we will be compelled to take due measures of self-defence to  safeguard the dignity of our nation and the sovereignty of our country."
