Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. said Thursday that it  would recall some 29,000 defective vehicles for gas tank repairs, the  transport ministry said.
Mazda will recall seven models, including Familia van and Familia wagon,  made between 1986 and 1994 because poor welding on the gas tank could result  in leaking fuel, the ministry said.
Suzuki Motor Corp., also of Japan, reported to the ministry that it would  recall 170,000 units of three car models, including Carry, produced between  1991 and 1992, because blinkers may not function due to insufficient anti-dust  protection for a switching system.
