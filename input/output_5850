Number one seed Stefan Edberg moved into the third  round of the Beckenham tournament with a two-set victory over American Kent  Kinnear on Tuesday.
After breezing through the first set 6-1, the Swede found himself 3-0 down  in the second to the 6ft 5in Kinnear and was 0-40 down on his serve in the  10th game, but ultimately came out on top by 7-4 in the tie break.
Edberg said: "You can't keep up winning for 12 months a year. Your form  must dip at some stage and May has been a bad month for me. You could call it  a bit of a disaster.
"But you've got to forget about the whole thing, dig deep and get it out  of your mind, or it can stay on your mind. It depends on the individual."
Edberg, 28, will now face Englishman Paul Hand, who pulled off one of the  shocks of the day by putting out America's 15th seed Todd Nelson, some 378  slots above him the world rankings.
British number five seed Jeremy Bates beat Danny Sapsford 6-1, 7-6.
