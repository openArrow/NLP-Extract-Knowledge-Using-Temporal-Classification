French Defense Minister Francois Leotard on  Wednesday confirmed that the French military contingent in former Yugoslavia  would be dropped by 2,500 men by the end of the year.
He said it was "a French decision determined by the evolution of the  crisis."
By the end of 1994, "we are going to drop the volume of our forces in  Bosnia and we are going to regroup them around Sarajevo. This is a decision we  have taken," Leotard said on French radio.
France now has 6,800 troops in former Yugoslavia, the backbone of the UN  contingent there. A thousand of them will be repatriated in June from northern  Krajina, a Serb-occupied Croat territory, while another 1,200 others are to  leave the Moslem pocket of Bihac in northwestern Bosnia in six months, the  defense ministry recently announced.
France, and later Britain, have both warned they would pull their forces  out of Bosnia if there is no breakthrough in the peace process. Britain has  about 3,000 troops in former Yugoslavia.
France on Wednesday was hosting talks by the belligerents and the  international contact group trying to restart peace talks. They were being  held in Talloires, in the French Alps, just across the border from Geneva.
Juppe warned Tuesday that "if the parties involved don't want peace we  will act accordingly."
French Socialist Party leader Michel Rocard on Wednesday urged that  "negotiations still be given a chance" but said they could only work "if there  is a serious threat of air strikes" backing them up.
Rocard also voiced support for lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia if  the lastest negotiation bid fails.
Given the lack of success of UN efforts to resolve the Bosnian crisis up  to now, he said "elementary morality would imply that at least if we cannot  protect the Bosnians, we let them protect themselves."
