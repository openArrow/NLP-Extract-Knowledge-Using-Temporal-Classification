Palestinians shot and wounded a  settler late Wednesday close to the Netzarim settlement in the first attack  only hours after the Israeli army withdrew from the Gaza Strip, military  sources said.
The settler was attacked while driving along a road being built around the  settlement when Palestinians driving in the opposite direction opened fire.
The Israeli army only finished redeploying and pulling out of the Strip  early Wednesday after 27 years of occupation.
Netzarim is one of 19 settlements which will stay in the Strip for the  first five years of interim Palestinian self-rule under the terms of the  Israel-PLO autonomy accord.
