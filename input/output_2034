Dozens of Gazans who were fired from  hospital jobs by Israel during the six years of uprising or intifada will be  allowed to return to work as soon as possible, a PLO official said Thursday.
Among those sacked for "security reasons" were Zakaria al Agha, a member  of the Palestinian Authority, who headed a department at the Nasser hospital  in Khan Yunes until 1988, as well as his wife, who is also a doctor.
He was thrown out for his membership of Fatah, the mainstream PLO movement  which is today the leader on the Strip after the Israeli army completed a  pullout on Wednesday.
"We have decided that all those who were sacked by the Israelis will get  their jobs back as quickly as possible so that we can work for the good of the  people," said Dr. Ryad Zanun, the chief of the PLO's Gaza health committee.
Zanun told a press conference the Palestinians would meet the challenge of  providing a proper health service.
The six Gaza hospitals muster only 900 beds or 1.1 per 1,000 inhabitants,  compared with 5.9 beds per 1,000 inside Israel.
Israel, which used to be in charge of the hospital services, will continue  to provide oxygen cylinders for anaesthetics and medicines to Gaza for three  months and food for the next month.
"During this time we will negotiate the best means and conditions for  obtaining these products from Israel or elsewhere in the world," said Hamis  Najjar, director general of the new Palestinian health service in Gaza.
The service will have an annual budget of 20 million dollars.
