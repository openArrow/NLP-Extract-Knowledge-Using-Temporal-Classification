The two were killed Monday in a shoot-out with the police in the heights  of Khavaf in Khorasan province. Three others were arrested.
Five drug traffickers were also arrested after a chase in the  Torbat-e-Heidarieh region of Khorasan, which is a key crossing-point for drugs  coming from Afghanistan, it said.
The two raids netted more than 520 kilograms (1,150 pounds) of opium.
