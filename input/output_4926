Mystery surrounded the end of a hostage-taking on  Saturday, as Russian officials said that the body of one of the captors had  not been found and a radio station reported that a ransom had also disappeared.
The reports contradicted official statements on Friday according to which  three gunmen who hijacked a schoolbus had been arrested and a fourth shot dead  after a helicopter chase which ended in the breakaway Moslem republic of  Chechnya.
The four men, ethnic Chechens armed with submachine-guns and a grenade,  hijacked the schoolbus Thursday near the Caucasus town of Mineralnye Vody,  taking 23 adults and 15 children hostage.
All the hostages were released safely.
On Saturday, Russian officials here confirmed radio reports that "the body  (of the fourth gunman) had never been found."
Russian radio meanwhile reported Saturday that the ransom of eight million  dollars had disappeared with the fourth man.
But a Russian interior ministry spokesman refused to comment on that  report, saying only that "there are lot of bags and counting the banknotes  would take a lot of time."
Tensions between Moscow and Chechnya have run high since October 1991 when  the tiny republic declared independence.
On Friday, Chechen leader Dzhokar Dudayev escaped unhurt from an  assassination attempt. His spokesman said that the car-bomb which killed the  Chechen interior minister, his deputy, and driver, bore the hallmarks of the  Russian intelligence service but was not linked to the hostage-taking.
