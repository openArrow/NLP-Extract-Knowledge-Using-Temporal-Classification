All Black trialist Jarrod Cunningham  kicked a last-minute penalty to snatch a 14-14 draw for Hawkes Bay against the  touring Tongan rugby team here Tuesday.
The fullback scored all of the Bay's points.
Tonga, chasing their fourth successive victory on a short four-match tour,  were left ruing lost scoring opportunities with several knock-ons and forward  passes halting threatening movements.
The visitors produced some exciting rugby in the second half with flanker  'Ipolito Fenukitau winning a feast of ball at the end of the lineout and  centre Tevita Va'emuku, who began the game on the wing, producing some  blistering runs.
Last quarter tries by Fenukitau, an intercept, and Manu Nunipola were  almost inevitable with the flood of possession and pulled the tourists back  from an 11-point deficit to give them the lead for the first time late in the  game.
