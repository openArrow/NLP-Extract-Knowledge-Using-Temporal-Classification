Aston Villa striker Dean Saunders will miss his  club's end of season tour to South Africa, in order to defend himself in a  court case, starting on Monday.
Saunders is being sued in the High Court by former Chelsea defender Paul  Elliott, over a tackle made by the Welsh international while playing for  Liverpool at Anfield in September 1992.
Elliott has since been forced to retire because of a serious knee injury.
Meanwhile, Villa will receive an extra 250,000 pounds for winger Tony  Daley if his new club, Wolverhampton Wanderers, are promoted to the  Premiership next season.
Wolves, managed by former England boss Graham Taylor, have already  finalised a 1.3 million pound fee for the 26-year-old winger.
