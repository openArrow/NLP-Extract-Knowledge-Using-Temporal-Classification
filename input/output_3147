The self-proclaimed Republic of Somaliland, which  broke away from Somalia three years ago, on Monday recognised the  newly-proclaimed Yemen Democratic Republic in the south of the country.
A statement faxed to AFP here from President Mohamed Ibrahim Egal in the  Somaliland capital, Hargeisa, said Somaliland would recognize the  constitutionality and legitimacy of the new sovereign republic in South Yemen  and would place at its disposal all its support.
Somaliland declared independence after the overthrow of Somali President  Mohamed Siad Barre, but has not been recognised internationally.
"Being well-placed by our own bitter experience to understand and  appreciate fully the dilemma which has faced the people and government of the  Democratic Republic of Yemen, we, the people and government of the Republic of  Somaliland, hasten to recognize the constitutionality and the legitimacy of  the sovereign republic", the statement said.
"Being un-recognized ourselves, we know that in international terms our  recognition carries no de-jure benefit for the Democratic Republic of Yemen,  but we place at the disposal of its government all our support", the statement  pointed out.
South Yemen declared its independence from the north on Friday and on  Sunday appointed former Yemeni Vice-President Ali Salem al-Baid as its new  president, with the port city of Aden as its capital.
But Yemen's President Ali Abdallah Saleh, a northern, has condemned Baid,  his sacked deputy, as "a traitor" and a statement from Sanaa hinted on  Saturday that the north would cut off ties with any country recognizing the  new republic.
The appointment of al-Baid came on the day Yemenis might have been  celebrating the fourth anniversary of union between the conservative, Moslem  north and the south.
