President Bill Clinton welcomed news Friday  that an international whaling body had created a huge no-hunting zone ringing  the South Pole over Japan's stiff objections.
"We are pleased that we were able to get so many other countries to agree  to a sanctuary," the president said in a statement.
"The United States will continue to exercise leadership in seeking  international agreement on the conservation of whales," he added.
Vice President Al Gore called the decision a major victory for whale  conservation.
The International Whaling Commission voted late Thursday to create a  no-hunt zone south of the 40th parallel in the Southern Hemisphere, which runs  south of Australia and Africa.
The sanctuary dips to 60 degrees south at South America to slip below  Chile and Argentina. The Indian Ocean was declared a whale sanctuary in 1979.
Japan cast the lone dissenting vote at the commission's annual meeting in  Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Norway did not cast a ballot.
In Tokyo, Japanese government and fishing industry officials denounced the  move and said the government would study its options on compliance. "We have  options ranging widely from withdrawal from the IWC to unconditional  acceptance of the decision," a senior official of the state fishery agency  said.
Among those whales protected by the sanctuary are the remaining 12,000  humpbacked whales and estimated 1,000 remaining blue whales, which grow to 30  meters (100 feet) and can weigh 150 tonnes.
The no-hunt zone would also benefit the much smaller minke whale favored  by Japanese and Norwegian whalers after the decimation of blue and humpback  populations.
