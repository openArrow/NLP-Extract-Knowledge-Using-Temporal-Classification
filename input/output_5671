Malawi's new government led by President Bakili  Muluzi will institute a commission of inquiry into the mysterious deaths of  four cabinet ministers during the former government's rule 11 years ago.
Home Affairs Minister Peter Fachi told AFP the decision to open an inquiry  has already been made and said Muluzi will name the members of the commission  on his return from a three-day foreign trip which began Tuesday.
The deaths of Dick Matenje, John Sangala, David Chiwanga and Aaron Gadama  in a car accident after they disappeared on May 17, 1983, from the southern  town of Zomba, has become a controversial human rights matter.
The government of former president Kamuzu Banda rejected calls for an  inquiry into the deaths.
Many Malawians suspect they were murdered for political reasons and after  they refused to carry out Banda's orders.
In early May, the country's High Court dismissed an application by  Muluzi's United Democratic Front, then in opposition, for an inquiry into the  deaths, saying it had failed to establish legal grounds in the case.
