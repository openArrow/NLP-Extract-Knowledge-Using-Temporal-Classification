Aston Villa striker Dalian Atkinson  declared open war on manager Ron Atkinson by skipping the club's tour of South  Africa on Monday.
Atkinson has already said his namesake star is up for sale. The player,  involved in a dressing-room bust-up with his manager last season, said he was  trying to sort out a problem for a friend and would not fly out.
