Hideshi Matsuda spent the past two  years watching the Indianapolis 500 as a Japanese television commentator.
Now he's part of the show.
Matsuda became only the second Japanese driver to make the 33-car field by  qualifying here Saturday.
"This is the happiest moment of my life," Matsuda said. "It's just like a  dream. I knew I wanted this two years ago when I came as a reporter. Since  then, I have dreamed of it every day."
Matsuda, this year's oldest Indy rookie at age 39, joins Hiro Matsushita  as the only Japanese starters here. Matsushita, trying for his third Indy  start, was waiting in line Saturday when rain ended time trials early.
Rain affected Matsuda as well. He was the first driver in line for a  qualifying run on the 2.5-mile (4km) oval, but had to sit through a rain delay  of 75 minutes. That added to the tension when Matsuda finally took the track,  zooming past 150,000 spectators screaming their support.
"I was very nervous because of the waiting and the weather," Matsuda said.  "But once I got into the car, that feeling disappeared. I stepped (the  accelerator) all the way to the floor and kept it there."
Matsuda had four consistent laps and qualified his 1993 Lola-Cosworth at  222.545 mph (356.072 km/h), briefly making him the fastest rookie in Indy 500  history.
"I was hoping to go even a little bit faster," said Matsuda, whose mark  was surpassed later by Canadian rookie Jacques Villeneuve.
