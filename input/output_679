Some 175 Somalis in a refugee camp near the  southern Yemeni town of Aden have been killed in the civil war raging there,  the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said Sunday citing residents of  the camp.
The provisional death toll, which did not include wounded casualties, was  transmitted to a UNHCR representative and a Red Cross official in Yemen who  both reached the camp Saturday, UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said.
"The people in the camp are very frightened, without food nor water,"  Redmond said.
He said that, of the 11,600 refugees earlier registered in the camp  located beside the Indian Ocean, only about 1,500 remained.
The rest had fled the fighting between Yemen's northern and southern  factions by heading toward Aden or other regions, he added.
He said the UNHCR and the Red Cross were debating whether to evacuate the  camp's remaining refugees to safer areas.
