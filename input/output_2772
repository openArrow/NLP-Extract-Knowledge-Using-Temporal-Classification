Ardy Wiranata smashed his way to victory over Ong  Ewe Hock to give Indonesia a winning 3-0 lead over their closest badminton  rivals Malaysia in the Thomas Cup final here Saturday.
Roared on by 10,000 flag waving supporters, Wiranata sealed a double win  for the Indonesians as the women's team won the Uber Cup from China on Friday.
The Indonesian star beat Ong 15-11, 15-5 to win the cup back from Malaysia.
All England champion Heryanto Arbie had laid the basis for the triumph by  beating Malaysian number one Rashid Sidek 15-6, 15-11.
Gunawan and Bambang Suprianto, the world number one doubles pair, then  beat Cheah Soon Kit and Soo Beng Kiang 15-10, 6-15, 15-8 to clear the way for  Wiranata to clinch victory.
"I am very happy that Indonesia could get the Thomas Cup and I thank God  for that," a delighted Heryanto said.
It was the ninth time Indonesia have won the Cup but the first time since  1984. They lost 3-2 to Malaysia in the 1992 final in Kuala Lumpur.
