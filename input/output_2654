A South Korean Air Force jet fighter with two pilots  aboard disappeared off the country's southwestern coast in bad weather and is  presumed to have crashed into the sea, a military spokesman said here  Saturday.
The F-4 disappeared late Friday over Wi Island off the southwestern coast  of South Korea, some 200 kilometers (122 miles) south of here, while on a  training mission from Chongju Airbase, and both pilots were listed as missing,  he said.
Search operations had failed to locate any trace of the jet or the pilots,  identified as Captain Won Wi-Sung and First Lieutenant Park Chung-Hoon.
