An expert commission from 31 countries Wednesday  began examining a 532-million-dollar reconstruction plan aimed at rebuilding  the shattered Bosnian capital of Sarajevo.
United Nations special coordinator William Eagleton unveiled the two-phase  programme Tuesday in Vienna, detailing what provision should be made to  rebuild the drinking water and public transport networks, restore electricity  and gas supplies and rebuild hospitals and schools.
Eagleton said the plan should be coordinated on two levels - on the ground  in the city itself and also politically. He stressed the importance of  coordination between local authorities and countries donating money to the  reconstruction fund.
He himself is to head a consultative committee on the spot, a conference  source said. The source added the Vienna conference was a "preliminary" move  aimed at getting the plan off the ground, before further details are worked  out at a June meeting in New York.
Eagleton said the Bosnian Serbs based at Pale, just outside Sarajevo, had  been informed of the scheme and appeared to approve of it.
The first phase will cover a six-month period, and foresees using around  half the total fund to deal with schemes classified as urgent. Restoring  drinking water alone is set to cost 57 million dollars. Phase two is scheduled  to last for up to two years.
The Vienna conference was called by UN special envoy to ex-Yugoslavia  Yasushi Akashi, while the basis of the plan was agreed by the UN Security  Council in March.
Bosnian delegation head Hasan Muratovic had Tuesday stressed the  importance of reestablishing transport links between Sarajevo and the Adriatic  coast, part of which Serb forces continue to block.
German ambassador to Bosnia, Johannes Preisinger, said stability around  the capital remained "precarious," but was sufficient to allow the  international community to address the issue of reconstruction. "Aid to  Sarejevo must continue," he added.
