Gold prices rose while the dollar lost ground  against all major foreign currencies with the exception of the pound sterling  during trading in mild trading Friday.
Friday's gold prices gained 4.50 dollars over Thursday to close at 385.90  per ounce.
As of 17H10 (21H10 GMT), the dollar cost 1.6465 deutschmark. Prices were  1.6480 and 1.6575 respectively early Friday afternoon and Thursday at closing.
Facing the yen, the dollar was valued at 104.11. It stood at 104.13 during  mid-day trading and closed at 104.30 Thursday.
The dollar weakened against the French and Swiss francs hitting 5.6305 FF  Friday compared with 5.6660 FF Thursday and 1.4055 Swiss francs Friday  compared with 1.4130 Thursday.
It gained some ground against the pound sterling at 0.6640 Friday compared  with 0.6633 Thursday. The latter faced pressure from the deutschmark in  morning cross trading.
The dollar continued to crumble during the afternoon, but traders  abstained from selling too aggressively to avoid central bank intervention  before the weekend, said a dealer with the American Security Bank.
According to him, selling could resume next week and then the markets will  test the will of the central banks to intervene.
