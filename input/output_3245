Russia is to sign a technical cooperation accord  with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OCDE) next  month, according to officials at OECD headquarters here.
The deal will establish a formal framework for relations between Russia  and the 25-nation Paris-based organization, with the OECD continuing and  broadening its technical assistance effort and policy advice to facilitate  Russian reforms.
The accord is expected to be signed at the end of the annual OECD  ministerial meeting, scheduled for June 7-8, the officials said.
They said the envisaged presence here of Russia's Foreign Minister Andrei  Kozyrev for an informal meeting with OECD delegation heads at the time of the  signing would underscore the political significance of the accord, negotiated  over a period of several months.
Diplomats at the OECD said over the weekend the accord would be much along  the lines of agreements concluded with the OECD's "partners in transition  (PIT)" -- Hungary, Poland and the Czech and Slovak republics -- under the PIT  programme signed two years ago.
The four countries, which have made more headway in reforms than Russia,  have all requested full OECD membership since last December.
The accord with Russia would give Russian government officials observer's  status in OECD committees covering areas of direct Russian interest, and would  call for OECD reviews of specific sectors of the Russian economy to assess  ways and means of reforms.
It would also involve Russia joining other economies in transition in OECD  consultative panels dealing with reforms in such fields as privatization,  foreign investment and environment.
Senior Russian government officials have already been invited to attend  dozens of technical OECD meetings and seminars for reformers on economic  management in market-based economies.
