Japan's Mitsubishi Estate Co. Ltd. said Wednesday  its pre-tax profit plunged 33 percent from a year earlier to 47.4 billion yen  (460 million dollars) in the year to March and forecast further declines this  year.
The company, the biggest landowner in Tokyo's central business district,  said revenue grew 26 percent to 440 billion yen in the same period.
Office rental income grew 12 percent to 250 billion yen while revenue from  real-estate sales jumped two thirds to 113 billion yen.
Mitsubishi Estate forecast lower earnings of 35 billion yen for the  current year with revenue dropping to 420 billion yen.
"The real estate market is expected to remain stagnant in the current  year," the company said. "Profit gains are unlikely without a recovery,  particularly in the rental apartment and office business sectors."
