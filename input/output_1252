Ceasefire violations are becoming increasingly  common in Sarajevo where frequent sniper fire was reported Tuesday, the UN  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) said Tuesday.
UNPROFOR spokesman Rob Annink said shooting in the center of Sarajevo "has  been steadily increasing" and was of great concern to the UNPROFOR and the  country's warring factions which means those responsible "are probably  uncontrolled" elements.
He said Bosnian Serb troops targeted a French Gazelle helicopter Monday as  it was flying over Ilijas, some about 15 kilometres (10 miles) northwest of  Sarajevo, but the pilot and crew were not injured.
Two armoured French vehicles were also targeted in the capital Monday.
The shooting is in violation of a ceasefire agreement signed by Bosnia's  warring parties in February after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  threatened air strikes.
Annink said that elsewhere in Bosnia the military activity was centered  near the northern town of Tuzla.
He said UN military observers stationed in the region counted more than 80  explosions in various areas Monday.
Mortar explosions were also reported in eastern and western Bosnia.
