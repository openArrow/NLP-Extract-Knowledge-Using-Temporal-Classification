At least 94 elephants were killed in Sri Lanka  last year and more are expected to be slaughtered in 1994, as man's battle  with the animal steps up, a press report here said Tuesday.
The elephant population in Sri Lanka, which has shrunk from 30,000 at the  turn of the century to an estimated 2,000 to 2,500 now, will further dwindle  if the current rate of killings was maintained, the Daily News quoted the  Wildlife and Nature Protection Society as saying.
"For the elephant to have a real chance, there should be a macro-plan that  takes into account the myriad factors that threaten to make these elephants an  isolated issue, without relating it to problems caused to villages of the  surrounding areas," the Society said.
Elephants are revered in Sri Lanka and are often paraded at Budhist  religious ceremonies.
But farmers, especially sugarcane cultivators, have been accused of  killing the sweet-toothed elephants for eating their crops.
And the elephants' habitat is at risk as development and irrigation  projects cut into Sri Lanka's forests, which have shrunk from 27 percent of  the total land area in 1983, to the current 20 percent.
"As more land is opened for development, forests are lost and and as the  elephant habitat shrinks, confrontation between man and the elephant will  increase, resulting in the decimation of the elephant population," the Society  warned.
