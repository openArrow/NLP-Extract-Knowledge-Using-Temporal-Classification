Before 1992, Dahlin had not fully graduated on the international scene.  Last summers' European Championship finals on home soil set him on the road to  celebrity status and he confirmed his potential in one of the toughest  qualifying groups.
Roy Hodgson, Switzerland's coach, who gave Dahlin his break in top flight  football when he brought him to Malmo in 1986, sums up the players' strengths.
"Martin is a born athlete. He is quick, has enormous power and endurance  in his legs, goes up well for crosses, and fights fire with fire in the box,"  Hodgson said.
Arsenal winger Anders Limpar, Schwartz and Napoli's Jonas Thern will have  the task of creating the chances that Dahlin can exploit.
Defensively the Swedes are extremely solid. In 10 games in group six, they  only conceded eight goals and in Thomas Ravelli, have one of the most  experienced goalkeepers around.
But misfortune can be just around the corner as Klas Ingesson discovered  when he returned from Holland where he plays for PSV Eindhoven.
His car hit a moose.
He needed 11 stitches to his face and whiplash damaged his back muscles  but latest reports said the powerful midfielder should make the World Cup  squad.
