Copper and nickel continued to soar on the London  Metal Exchange (LME) on Monday, rising respectively to a 16-month and a  19-month high, dealers said.
Copper jumped 48 dollars higher to close at 2,278 dollars per tonne, while  nickel flew 285 dollars higher to 6,760 dollars per tonne from 6,475 at the  Friday close.
"After profit-taking on Friday, we have seen general buying in copper as  there is a fair amount of physical tightness on the market," said William  Adams, analyst at Rudolf Wolff.
Dealers said copper has very firm fundamentals with regular drawdowns in  stocks and increases in demand in Europe and the United States.
Nickel rose in the wake of copper and on the prospects of a strike at  Canadian producer Inco's Sudbury division where the current labor contract is  set to expire at the end of this month, said Adams.
The market believes Inco has the ability to continue nickel deliveries for  only three weeks in the event of industrial action, which workers have voted  for if the contract is not renewed.
The factory produces around 9,000 tonnes of refined nickel per month,  around nine percent of western production, said John Bergtheil, analyst for  Metals and Minerals Research Services.
Elsewhere, lead closed eight dollars higher at 503 dollars per tonne, zinc  was 10 dollars higher at 1,000 dollars per tonne, and aluminium was 6.5  dollars higher at 1,376.5 dollars per tonne.
The price of tin rose by 50 dollars to close at 5,675 dollars per tonne.
