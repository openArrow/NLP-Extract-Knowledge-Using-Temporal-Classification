Peru's booming gold mining industries should boost  output to 100 tonnes per year by the end of the decade, Mining and Energy  Minister Daniel Hokama said Sunday.
"We estimate that gold production currently ranges between 20 and 25  tonnes annually, and if the gram of gold is at 12 dollars, we are talking  about a total sum of 250 to 300 million dollars per year" through 2000, Hokama  said.
"Our intention and that of domestic and international mining investors is  to reach an output level at the end of the decade of approximately 100 tonnes  a year," Hokama said.
"And we think that at 100 tonnes we could become the top gold producer in  this part of the world."
Peru has the world's seventh greastest unmined gold resources.
