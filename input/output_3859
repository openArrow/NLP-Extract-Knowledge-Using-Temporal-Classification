Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) have completed their inspection of a controversial nuclear  reactor in North Korea and took samples from spent fuel rods, IAEA officials  said in Vienna Wednesday.
The samples should allow the IAEA to determine how long the fuel rods were  in the Yongbyon reactor and thereby calculate whether plutonium could have  been manufactured or diverted, possibly for use in making nuclear bombs.
Plutonium is a key element for making nuclear bombs.
Earlier Wednesday IAEA spokesman Hans-Friedrich Meyer announced that one  inspector who was part of a three-man team that arrived in North Korea last  week to carry out the inspection had left the country.
The other two inspectors were holding talks Wednesday with officials in  Pyongyong along with two special IAEA envoys who arrived in the North Korean  capital Tuesday.
The talks, which were expected to continue through Thursday, were focusing  on future measurements of fuel rods at the reactor.
The United States suspects North Korea of diverting some of its nuclear  fuel for military purposes, a charge denied by the government in Pyongyong.
