New York's Supreme Court upheld a lower court  decision Thursday denying film star Woody Allen custody of three children in a  bitter court battle with his ex-lover and former leading lady Mia Farrow.
The court also ordered Allen to pay 1.2 million dollars to cover Farrow's  legal expenses in the dispute over the couple's six-year-old biological son,  Satchel as well as two children adopted by the couple.
Elkan Abramowitz, Allen's lawyer, said the film director and actor was  "bitterly disappointed" by the ruling and said he may seek further appeals.
The appeals court ruled that Allen, who acknowledged sleeping with Soon-Yi  Previn, Farrow's 22-year-old adopted daughter, showed "an absence of any  parenting skill."
The court maintained an order barring Allen from visiting seven-year-old  Dylan and 16-year-old Moses, who were adopted by the couple during their  relationship that ended in 1992.
Allen was cleared of Farrow's accusations that he molested Dylan.
