Police said Monday they arrested two men here in  connection with the kidnap-murder earlier this month of a Chinese shark fin  exporter.
Police spokesman Colonel Raymond Dowd said the two unidentified suspects,  aged 25 and 29, were held in connection with the death of Michael Shen, 44,  who was bundled into a car from his dockside place of business on May 12 by  men posing as police officers.
Shen's body was found over the weekend in the bush outside Cape Town and  an autopsy was scheduled for later Monday, Dowd said.
Police also said they had footage, filmed by a bank video camera, of  another suspect as he tried to cash a 10,000-rand (2,857-dollar) check signed  by Shen, who owned a business called King's International Exporters and  Importers.
Dowd said police were still investigating a motive and expected to make  more arrests.
