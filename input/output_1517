Philippine Long Distance and Telephone Co. (PLDT),  the country's main telecommunications firm, announced here Thursday it had  boosted total assets to 67.2 billion pesos (2.4 billion dollars) in the first  quarter of this year.
This represented a 3.8 billion peso or a six percent increase in its total  assets, a PLDT statement issued here said.
The company said the increase in assets was due largely to a 2.1 billion  peso investment in equipment for the central office as well as other  investments in cable and wire facilities, information equipment, land and  building improvement and vehicle and furniture purchases.
PLDT also said it had installed a total of 33,806 telephones in the first  three months of the year, boosting its total number of lines to 1.4 million.
It enjoyed a virtual monopoly on telephone services until last year, when  President Fidel Ramos deregulated the industry, forcing the company to deal  with a number of emerging rivals.
