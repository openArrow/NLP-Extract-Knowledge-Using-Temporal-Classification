MADRID, May 21 (AFP) - Basque separatist group ETA has written to more  than 100 Madrid-based businessmen and firms demanding payment of a  "revolutionary tax" of up to 100 million pesetas (730,000 dollars), El Pais  reported Saturday.
The Spanish ministries of justice and of the interior were unable to  confirm the report.
Citing "recent corruption scandals" which have dogged Spain's  Socialist-led government, ETA demanded from each addressee "a first payment of  100 million ... of what you have stolen from the Basque country."
The terrorist organisation, which previously had only threatened  businessmen and companies in the Basque region, condemned the businesses for  belonging to a political class which "amasses profits and benefits from  corruption."
ETA also accused the businessmen of "connivence" with politicians and the  Basque middle class in order to "plunge thousands of Basque citizens into  unemployment and misery."
El Pais said several recipients of the letters had complained to the  authorities.
ETA recently freed entrepreneur Julio Iglesias Zamora, kidnapped and held  for 117 days, after payment of a large ransom.
