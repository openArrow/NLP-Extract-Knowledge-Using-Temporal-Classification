The speaker of the Duma, the lower house of the  Russian parliament, Ivan Rybkin, has been made a member of the Russian  security council by presidential decreee, ITAR-TASS news agency reported  Tuesday.
The move was seen as President Boris Yeltsin's way of thanking Rybkin for  joining his civil accord initiative last April 28. Signatories of the pact  agreed to refrain from political violence until presidential elections in June  1996. The security council advises the president on security issues.
Until now there had been no member of the Duma elected on December 12 on  the security council, the country's top body in charge of internal and  external security. The old Supreme Soviet, before it was dissolved in  September 1993, was represented on the council by its vice president.
Rybkin's admission takes the council's membership up to 13, three of them  permanent: Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and the council's  secretary Oleg Lobov.
Yeltsin also created a new department within the presidential  administration in charge of relations with the Duma and Council of the  Federation, parliament's upper house, ITAR-TASS said.
