Two US soldiers killed in Somalia were awarded  the nation's highest military honor Monday by President Bill Clinton, who  praised the valor of those fought and died in the African nation.
Clinton presented the Medal of Honor to the widows of Master Sergeant Gary  Gordon and Sergeant 1st Class Randall Shutgart, calling them "real American  heroes."
The sergeants were killed October 3 trying to rescue crewmen from a  helicopter downed in a US raid on a Mogadishu hotel.
The only crew member to survive, Michael Durant, credited their action  with saving his life. Durant was captured, beaten and held for 11 days.
In the fighting that followed, 18 Americans and an estimated 300 Somalis  were killed -- a debacle that prompted Clinton to order the withrawal of US  forces from Somalia.
"Any debates still to be had about our mission in Somalia, let people have  those debates where they belong -- with the president and policymakers. But  let there be no doubt about the ... valor of those who served there and the  valor of those who died there," Clinton said.
Gordon's two children, Ian, 6, and Brittany,3, stood at the side of their  mother, Carmen, as she received the medal from the president. Stephanie  Shughart received her husband's medal.
At the ceremony, Clinton told an audience of congressional and military  leaders and family members that the two sergeants acted above and beyond the  call of duty.
"They jumped into the ferocious firefight ... They risked their lives  without hesitation," he said.
Created by Congress in 1863, the Medal of Honor has been won by some 3,400  men for heroism under fire. The sole woman to win the medal was Mary Walker,  the first woman doctor to serve in the US Army.
