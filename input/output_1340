The British conglomerate Hanson on Tuesday  announced a 35 percent increase in interim pre-tax profits to March to 683  million pounds (1.03 billion dollars) from 507 million pounds for the same  period a year earlier.
The figures, at the top end of analysts' expectations, showed a trading  profit of 473 million pounds compared with 436 million pounds.
Earnings per share rose to 9.9 pence from 7.7 pence for the same six-month  period a year ago, while the quarterly dividend rose to three pence from 2.85  pence.
Chairman Lord Hanson said that the beginning of 1994 had seen "a brighter  picture" in most of Hanson's major activities with trading companies  "beginning to benefit from this improved outlook" with a return to profits  established.
Hanson said the group's first-half profit was "excellent" after bearing  the final cost of a coal strike at its US subsidiary Peabody of 80 million  pounds, compared with 25 million pounds a year earlier.
He said the total pre-tax profit included exceptional profit of 331  million pounds, up from 40 million pounds, which more than offset the forecast  interest charge now expected to be 250 million pounds, compared with an income  of 14 million pounds.
Businesses and fixed assets sold raised 898 million pounds during the  period, with a major contribution from the flotation of Beazer Homes on the  stock exchanges in Britain and the United States.
Lord White, chairman of Hanson Industries, the group's US arm, said US  operating profit in the first half was 245 million pounds, up from 191 million  pounds a year earlier.
The price of Hanson shares rose by 5.5 pence to 268.5 pence in afternoon  trading because the market was encouraged by news that Hanson had raised its  second quarterly dividend to three pence.
James Capel analyst Paul Beaufrere said news of Hanson's second quarter  dividend increase was "a surprise" and a "very encouraging" signal to the  market.
