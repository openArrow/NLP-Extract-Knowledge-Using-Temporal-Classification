An offer by ethnic Chinese tycoon Lucio Tan  guaranteeing a two billion peso (71.43 million dollars) for Philippine  Airlines (PAL) in return for full management control was Friday being examined  by the government, its biggest shareholder.
Tan controls PR Holdings Inc, the consortium which acquired 67 percent of  the troubled airline from the government in 1992, but he is hampered by its  dominance of the PAL board.
Cesar Sarino, one of six government representatives on the 14-member  board, said PR Holdings had guaranteed the airline would turn a two  billion-peso annual profit should Tan be given "full management control."
Tan, who holds five seats on the board, previously asked several foreign  entities, including Hong Kong-based Robert Kuok whom he is believed to have  personally approached, to buy into the government's holdings in PAL to ensure  management of the airline was secured by the private sector.
Spokesmen for PR Holdings and PAL management declined to comment on the  reported offer.
The government holds 46 percent equity in PAL, 33 percent directly and the  rest through its companies which are members of the PR Holdings consortium.
Those companies have have previously expressed reluctance to part with  their holdings.
PAL sources said the airline, which scrapped its unprofitable Rome flight  this month, was in danger of going into the red. Revenue and profit figures  for fiscal 1993 ended March still have to be made public.
Its net profit in the first nine months of its fiscal year were 56.9  million pesos (2.03 million dollars), compared with 1.025 billion pesos (36.6  million dollars) for all of 1992.
PAL attributed the decline to various charges, such as adjustment in  earning figures, expenses on grounded planes and the write-off of unservicable  parts.
