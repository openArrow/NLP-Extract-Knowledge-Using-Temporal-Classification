The dollar closed lower at 103.58 yen on the Tokyo  foreign exchange market Thursday, down 0.60 yen from the previous day's finish  of 104.18 yen.
The Tokyo market mostly reflected trends in New York, where the dollar  lost ground despite the interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve Board,  dealers said.
The closing rate here was moderately higher than 103.45 yen quoted in New  York in late trading Wednesday.
After opening at 103.60 yen, the greenback moved narrowly between 103.46  yen and 103.68 yen here Thursday.
Spot turnover decreased from the previous day's 5.877 billion dollars to  4.232 billion dollars.
The central Bank of Japan sold yen for dollars on the foreign exchange  market Thursday, dealers said. The size of the dollar-supporting market  intervention was not immediately clear.
Investors said they were concerned about Japan's huge trade surplus with  the United States, which might invite pressure from Washington to bring the  Japanese currency higher.
The mark closed at 1.6555 to the dollar here Thursday, against 1.6741 the  previous day.
