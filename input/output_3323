The United States reaffirmed its support for a  unified Ukraine facing a secessionist Crimean peninsula in a letter from  Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Monday.
In a letter addressing the Crimean parliament's vote Friday to secede from  the Ukraine, Christopher said he "recognized the responsible and conciliatory  approach that Ukraine has adopted thus far and urged the Ukrainian government  to continue to exercise restraint."
The letter was addressed to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoly Zlenko,  said State Department spokesman Mike McCurry.
The Ukraine has refused to honor the Crimean parliament's decision Friday  to restore a 1992 constitution, seen by Kiev as tantamount to a declaration of  independence. The Ukrainian parliament has given the local legislature until  next Monday to reverse its decision.
Kiev has contacted the United Nations, the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe and North Atlantic Treaty Organization to warn that it  reserved the right to take any step necessary to guarantee its territorial  integrity.
But McCurry said the dispute should have no bearing on the Ukraine's  January 14 pledge to dismantle its nuclear arsenal inherited from the Soviet  Union. The dismantling is "proceeding satisfactorily," he said.
