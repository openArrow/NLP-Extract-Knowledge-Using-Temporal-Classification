Secessionist forces in Yemen claimed Tuesday  to have beaten back troops loyal to President Ali Abdallah Saleh towards the  western border of the southern breakaway state proclaimed in Aden.
Radio Aden quoting a southern military spokesman said southern troops had  "pushed back enemy units towards the western border of South Yemen" in the  region of Kharaz-Bab al-Mandeb on the Gulf of Aden.
The spokesman said the the north had lost "thousands of dead and wounded"  in the battle.
Earlier a military spokesman in Aden said more than 400 northern soldiers  had died during a southern counter-offensive north west of Aden on Monday in  which southern troops recaptured Al-Anad where the south has a large air base.
Northern troops reportedly seized Al-Anad on May 17.
Radio Aden also said southern warplanes had carried out air raids against  enemy forces in the oil-producing province of Shabwa east of Aden where  northern forces have made a breakthrough.
Northern troops are pursuing a major offensive in Shabwa, where on Monday  they captured the provincial capital Ataq about 300 kilometers (200 miles)  north east of Aden.
In Sanaa, the capital of the four-year-old unified Yemen which split again  earlier this month, a northern military spokesman said late Tuesday that  northern forces were stepping up pressure on the secessionists in Hadhramaut  and Shabwa provinces and on the southern highway from Aden to Lahaj.
Ali Salem al-Baid, Saleh's former vice-president and leader of the Yemen  Democratic Republic proclaimed early on Saturday by the south, acknowledged  Tuesday that northern troops had achieved a "breakthrough" at Ataq but he said  they had not reached the oil wells in Shabwa province.
Al-Baid is now in Mukalla, his home-town in Hadhramaut, and is engaged in  an uphill bid to rally tribal leaders to boost the strength of his army which  is outnumbered by that of the north.
