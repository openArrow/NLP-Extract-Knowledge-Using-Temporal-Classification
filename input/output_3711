The White House acknowledged that the UN embargo against Haiti was being  circumvented by smuggling from the Dominican Republic said President Bill  Clinton's special Haiti envoy William Gray would travel to Santo Domingo to  discuss the matter.
"Certainly there has been leakeage. There is no question about that," said  Myers.
Myers said Gray would meet Wednesday with Dominican President Joaquin  Ballaguer and other officials to "convey our views on enforcing the embargo."
"We expect the Dominican Republic to help in that regard," Myers said. "We  expect them to help seal that border and enforce the sanctions."
The spokeswoman said Washington would provide any technical assistance  needed for enforcement by the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of  Hispaniola with Haiti.
The international media has extensively reported on the intense contraband  of fuel and other supplies across the two countries' border since the trade  embargo went into effect Sunday.
The toughened sanctions was the latest step in an international effort to  restore to power Haiti's democratically-elected President Jean-Bertrand  Aristide, who was ousted in a military coup September 30, 1991.
