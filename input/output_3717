With two of the nine days play now completed in  the Far East Bridge championships here Wednesday, the fields in the three  events are starting to sort themselves into something approaching  pre-tournament rankings.
In the open teams event five of the 22 rounds have now been played with  Chinese Taipei holding a two point margin over defending champions Indonesia.
A further three points behind is the surprise of the championship so far,  Japan, who had not been expected to be in the top group.
In the women's teams event the defending champions China are making no  race of it and have already opened up a 13 point gap at the head of the field.  Tied in second place after five of the 20 rounds are Australia and Indonesia.
The field of nine countries in the youth teams championship has already  opened out almost into two events. Chinese Taipei and Australia are tied in  the lead, closely followed by China, New Zealand and Indonesia.
