Australian private sector spending on capital  goods, including buildings, plants and equipment, fell 5.4 percent in the  three months to March 31, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday.
In real terms, seasonally adjusted capital expenditure fell to 5.884  billion Australian dollars (4.2 billion US) from 6.221 billion dollars in the  previous three months.
The figure was also 2.3 percent below the March quarter 1993 figure of  6.020 billion dollars.
In raw figures, the bureau predicted a six percent rise in the 12 months  to June 30, 1995 on the 1993-94 forecast for total private capital expenditure  of 27.452 billion dollars.
However, the 1994-95 forecast rise depended on actual capital expenditure  exceeding latest private sector expectations by about 10 percent. This had  occurred during 1992-93 and was likely to happen in 1993-94, the bureau said.
