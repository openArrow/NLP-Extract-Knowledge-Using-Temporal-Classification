Singapore's economy grew by a  better-than-expected 11 percent in the first quarter of this year, the Trade  and Industry Ministry announced Monday.
"Growth was mainly fuelled by the exceptionally strong performance in the  manufacturing sector and continued good performance in the financial and  services sector," the ministry said in a statement.
Gross domestic product (GDP) had grown by 7.5 percent in the same quarter  a year ago and 10.7 percent in the last quarter of 1993.
The first quarter growth exceeded the most optimistic forecast by private  sector economists who had predicted strong economic expansion, but not  exceeding 10.5 percent.
The statement said the Consumer Price Index, which measures inflation,  rose by 3.2 percent from the year ago period and was one percent higher  compared to the previous quarter.
