For every Asian-American household with an annual income of 75,000 dollars  or more, there is roughly another earning below 10,000 dollars, <EVENT eid="e5" class="REPORTING" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">according</EVENT> to  the study by the Asian Pacific American Public Policy Institute.&#13;
Additionally, the percentage of Asian-Americans <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">living</EVENT> below the poverty  line is about one-and-a-half times greater than that of whites, the study  <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">showed</EVENT>.&#13;
"In contrast to the pervasive and persistent view of Asian Pacific  Americans as the affluent, successful 'model minority,' the report <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">reveals</EVENT> a  much more diverse economic picture," the organization <EVENT eid="e9" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT>.&#13;
