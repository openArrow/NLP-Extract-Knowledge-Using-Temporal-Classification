British driver Nigell Mansell was reported to be  considering a multi-million dollar offer for his return to Formula One racing.
According to the Sun newspaper, Williams-Renault want the reigning  Indy-Car champion back in Formula One as a replacement for Brazilian ace  Ayrton Senna who was killed at Imola earlier this month.
Williams were said to be desperate for Mansell, who won the F1 world title  in 1992, to take on German rival Michael Schumacher, the runaway leader in  this year's championship.
Williams were understood to have made an offer of nine million pounds  (13.5 million dollars) for just 10 races.
Williams team boss Frank Williams is due to collect a 16 million pound (24  million dollar) insurance payout for Senna's death.
Mansell's Newman-Haas team boss Carl Haas was quoted in the Sun as saying  he was aware the British driver had been involved in talks with Williams.
"But I understand it is for selected races rather than for the rest of the  season," Haas said.
Only last week the Newman-Haas team denied reports that Mansell had been   contemplating a return to F1 in the wake of Senna's death.
