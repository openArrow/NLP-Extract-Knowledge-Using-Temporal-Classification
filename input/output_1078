US Defence Secretary William Perry arrived in  Ottawa on Monday to discuss possible US and Canadian participation in any  international military intervention in Haiti and the future of a joint defence  pact between Canada and the United States.
Perry, who is scheduled to meet with his Canadian counterpart David  Collenette, Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet and Prime Minister Jean Chretien  during his two-day visit, said of Haiti: "We would hope that Canada would be a  part of that peacekeeping force."
But Perry refused to speculate how any group of peacekeepers might be used  in the Caribbean nation. Canada is already a member of an international naval  force stopping embargoed goods arriving in Haiti.
Collenette, who greeted Perry on his arrival, told reporters that Canada  was not yet committed to taking part in an international peacekeeping force.  Any such role would still have to be discussed, he said.
Perry admitted that the time had come to discuss the future of the North  American Aerospace Command (NORAD), but downplayed a weekend announcement by  the Chretien government that Canada would not allow any more US cruise missile  tests in its Arctic north after this year.
The US defence secretary maintained modern technology meant there was no  longer any real need for such testing, but he added: "I think it's time to  re-think the specific future and the specific structure of NORAD."
Designed to provide for the joint air defence of both countries during the  Cold War, the NORAD treaty is scehduled to be renewed in 1996.
