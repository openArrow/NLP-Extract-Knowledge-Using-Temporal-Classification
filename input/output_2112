British athletics has won a sponsorship deal that  will boost the sport by around two million pounds.
A leading food company will sponsor the AAA Championships at Sheffield on  June 11 and 12, the GB-USA international at Gateshead on July 20 and three  unnamed events in 1995.
More than one million pounds will go directly to the sport, with a similar  amount spent by the company in promotion.
The news comes as a breath of fresh air for the British Athletic  Federation in an otherwise difficult period.
Apart from losing other sponsors, promotions director Andy Norman was  dismissed last month after being accused of spreading allegations of sexual  harassment against journalist-coach Cliff Temple, who later committed suicide,  and coaching chief Frank Dick resigned from the federation.
