The Palestinian Broadcasting  Corporation will open a press centre in the autonomous Jericho enclave later  this week for journalists to cover the return of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat.
"We don't know when he's coming but we want to be ready from the first  week of June," said corporation official Adnan Hamad.
Arafat is expected to reach the West Bank oasis in mid-June, but the  unofficial date has already been delayed several times.
The PBC began three days ago to install the centre in the Hisham Palace  hotel which it has taken over for 10,000 dollars a month.
The two-storey hotel will be rented out to the media at a weekly rate of  800 dollars a square metre (10.76 sq ft), Hamad told AFP.
Israel's telecommunications firm Bezeq has pledged to set up 100 telephone  lines, or more if needed, and satellite television communications are also to  be available.
Since Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in 1967, the 30-room  Hisham's Palace has only been open for business between 1978 and 1984.
There are no other hotels in Jericho, which has a population of just  15,000, and the PBC intends to rent rooms for journalists in private houses.
