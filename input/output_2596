The UN High Commissioner on Refugees has  agreed to help the United States in implementing a new policy that allows for  a hearing to Haitian refugees seeking political asylum, the White House said  Friday.
A statement issued by staff travelling with President Bill Clinton said  the UN office would help train US personnel, monitor the process and assist in  finding a third country for interviews of Haitians who flee their impoverished  homeland.
Clinton announced earlier this month that the United States would stop  immediate repatriation of Haitians intercepted at sea and provide a hearing at  sea or in a third country to determine which qualify for political asylum.
"UNHCR involvment is in keeping with the president's pledge to secure  international cooperation in providing Haitians with fundamental fairness and  humane treatment," said the White House.
