Talks between nuclear inspectors and North Korea on  the monitoring of fuel rods and regular inspections of the Yongbyon nuclear  reactor resumed here Thursday, a spokesman for the International Atomic Energy  Agnecy (IAEA) said.
He said the talks, which began Wednesday, were expected to continue  through Friday.
The North Korean government has so far refused to allow IAEA inspectors to  monitor the refueling of its five-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon, the country's  only nuclear power plant located 90 kilometres (55 miles) north of the capital  Pyongyang.
IAEA inspectors on Wednesday completed maintenance work on surveillance  equipment installed at the plant and were allowed to take samples from a  nuclear reprocessing plant, also at Yongbyon.
The samples should allow the agency to determine whether plutonium could  have been manufactured or diverted, possibly for use in making nuclear bombs.
The inspectors, however, arrived after North Korea had begun refueling its  Yongbyong reactor and some of the 8,000 fuel rods had already been removed.
The IAEA charged that by starting the refueling before the arrival of the  inspectors, North Korea was in violation of IAEA inspection terms and that the  agency would inform the UN Security Council for possible punitive sanctions.
The agency added, however, that it was still possible to take samples from  the spent fuel rods to determine whether plutonium was diverted for military  purposes.
