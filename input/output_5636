Malawi's new president, Bakili Muluzi, left here  Tuesday for neighbouring Mozambique in the first leg of a five-nation tour of  southern African countries.
Muluzi, making his first trip outside the country since his inauguration  10 days ago, flew in a private BAE 125 aircraft often used by former president  Kamuzu Banda.
He was seen off at Chileka airport by a small crowd of senior ruling  United Democratic Party (UDF) officials and Malawi's diplomats abroad who were  called home for "consultations".
Muluzi, who defeated Banda in the country's first democratic elections two  weeks ago, will also visit Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana and Tanzania.
He is accompanied by four cabinet ministers, Harry Thomson of Industry,  Commerce and Tourism, Edward Bwanali of External Affairs, Brown Mpinganjira of  Information and Broadcasting, and Colins Chizumila of Transport and  Communications.
Meanwhile, the Daily Times of Malawi, owned by Banda, has criticised the  visit, saying it is too soon.
The paper also said Muluzi's entourage of 20 people - is too big and  raises questions about the government's commitment to conserve the "little  foreign exchange it has inherited".
