A Northwest Airlines DC-10 jet, carrying 259 people,  made an emergency landing at Tokyo's Narita airport Friday after developing  engine trouble while flying over the Pacific from Nagoya to Honolulu, Hawaii.
The plane, with one of its three engines shut down, touched down safely at  Narita at 12:35 a.m. (1535 GMT Thursday) while fire trucks stood by, airline  and airport officials said.
The captain, identified only as D. Walter, radioed to Narita's aviation  office that his DC-10 needed to land at the airport after its left-wing engine  had developed trouble some two hours after take-off from Nagoya, central  Japan, the officials said.
It was the second air incident within 24 hours at Narita, northeast of  Tokyo. The captain of a British Airways Boeing 747-400 died of a heart attack  on a flight from London to Tokyo, but his two co-pilots steered the plane with  331 people on board to a flawless landing at Narita on Thursday.
On Sunday, two packed jumbo jets nearly collided over Japan due to faulty  commands from air traffic controllers.
