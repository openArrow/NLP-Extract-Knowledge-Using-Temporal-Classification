Six adults and two children died early Friday when  fire swept through a furniture factory and salesroom in northern Bangkok,  trapping the victims in their second-storey living quarters, police said.
Iron grilles on doors and windows prevented the victims from escaping the  blaze, police said.
Radio reports said 10 workers managed to escape, but police could not  immediately confirm the figure.
The cause of the fire, which broke out at around 1:30 a.m. and raged for  over an hour, was under investigation, police said.
