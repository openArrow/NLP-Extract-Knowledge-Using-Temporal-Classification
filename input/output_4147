Cambodia's monarch, heads of government and the  nominal leader of the rebel Khmer Rouge faction arrived in Pyongyang on  Thursday to begin peace talks, the official Chinese Xinhua news agency said.
King Norodom Sihanouk, co-prime ministers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun  Sen, parliamentary speaker Chea Sim and Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan  arrived in the North Korean capital for the talks which are scheduled to begin  Friday.
The Pyongyang talks, which are set to last until the end of May, were  proposed by King Sihanouk on May 17 when he called for the government and the  Khmer Rouge, also known as the Democratic Kampuchea Party, to negotiate a  peace settlement.
The Cambodian leaders and Khmer Rouge chief arrived on the same flight  Thursday and were greeted at the airport by North Korean Vice President Li  Jong-Ok and Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Kim Yong-Nam, Xinhua said in a  dispatch monitored in Beijing.
The Khmer Rouge has been fighting Cambodian government forces since it and  other Cambodian factions signed the Paris peace agreements in 1991, formally  ending 13 years of war in the Indochinese nation.
In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin was quoted as  saying that King Sihanouk and Queen Norodom Monineath Sihanouk would pay an  official visit to China June 2-4.
Chinese President Jiang Zemin invited the Cambodian royal couple, Wu said.
