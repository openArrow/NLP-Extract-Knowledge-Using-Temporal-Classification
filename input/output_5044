The scheduled arrival here Sunday of Chile's former  military dictator Augusto Pinochet is set to trigger a demonstration by  anarchists Tuesday in the historic square of the old city.
General Pinochet, who is still commander-in-chief of Chile's army, is  touring Europe at the head of a trade delegation from the army's weapons  procurement department.
He will be in Prague at the invitation of the Czech arms firm Omnipol,  amid strict security.
Chilean correspondents in Prague said his party had made reservations at  several of the city's hotels.
Press reports are comparing Pinochet's visit with the planned tour Russian  nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky had to call off last March in the face  of a hostile reaction from the authorities.
The daily "Mlada Fronta Dnes" said the Czech authorities should "publicly  distance themselves from this visit, lest they be accused of betraying  democratic principles for the sole purpose of selling weapons."
Czech President Vaclav Havel has said he is "not particularly happy" about  the visit, and Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has formally denied a claim by his  own Defence Minister Antonin Baudys that the visit was consequent to Klaus's  recent trip to Chile.
Klaus said he saw no reason to ban arms sales to Chile or negotiations  between private Czech businesses and Chile, which now met all the criteria of  a democracy.
