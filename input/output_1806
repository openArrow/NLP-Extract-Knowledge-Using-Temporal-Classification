Nuclear waste, including discarded reactors  from Russian submarines, threatens the Arctic waters of Norway and Alaska  warned Norwegian Prime Minister Harlem Gro Brundtland Wednesday.
"The situation is alarming and may affect a number of allied countries.  Due to the sea currents flowing out of the Barents (Sea) region, Alaska might  be just as badly affected as Norway," said Brundtland.
The Kola peninsula, Russian territory just east of Norway, shelters the  world's largest nuclear fleet, including roughly 100 active and 60 retired  submarines, she said.
"Before the year 2000 an additional 30 submarines are scheduled for  retirement," she said.
"Russian naval commanders have voiced fears that decommissioned subs which  are in poor condition and manned by unmotivated crews may sink at dockside and  cause an ecological disaster..." she added.
According to Brundtland, the Russians will be hard pressed to handle the  threat.
She said storage sites for radioactive materials on the peninsula are  already full, but the Russians have only removed a third of the fuel from the  subs.
The threat also extends to Novaya Zemlya, a Russian island in the Arctic  Sea northeast of the Kola peninsula. The island lies just hundreds of miles  from Alaska.
"All categories of nuclear waste, ranging from liquid radioactive waste to  six reactors with used fuel have been dumped in the Kara Sea to the east of  Novaya Zemlya," said Brundtland.
Her comments came during a speech at the European Institute, a private  group promoting the European Union in the United States.
