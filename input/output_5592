Northern and Southern Yemeni troops on Tuesday  exchanged sporadic artillery fire around this southern city, an AFP  correspondent reported.
The fighting was mainly at the Al-Anad front, 60 kilometers (36 miles)  north of Aden and Abyan 35 kilometers (21 miles) east of the city.
Several MiG 21 were spotted taking off from Aden airport.
The fighting continued as the UN Security Council was due later in the day  to discuss the civil war that erupted on May 5 between northern forces of  President Ali Abdallah Saleh and those of his southern rival Ali Salem  al-Baid.
Baid proclaimed a breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic on May 20, but it  has not been recognised internationally.
