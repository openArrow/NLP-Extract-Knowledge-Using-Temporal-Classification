Thousands of Kurds have fled their homes in  northeast Iraq amid intensified fighting between rival Kurdish factions,  Tehran radio said Monday.
The radio reported stepped-up clashes in Arbil, Qala Diza, Sulaymaniyeh  and the Haj-Omran region of Halabja, near the Iranian border, despite three  ceasefire accords and the setting up of a joint committee to supervise an end  to the fighting.
Thousands have fled the fighting in the past few days, including 600  families in Halabja, the radio said.
Clashes between the two main factions in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq,  the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK),  erupted in early May and have left at least 100 dead.
They have split Iraqi Kurdistan into two regions each controlled by one  faction.
Meanwhile, PUK and KDP representatives met Monday in Turkey, near the  Iraqi border, to try to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the conflict.
Northern Iraq has been under Kurdish control since it was established with  the help of the US-led coalition that drove Iraqi occupying forces out of  Kuwait in February 1991.
