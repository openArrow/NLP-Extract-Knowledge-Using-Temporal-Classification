One of the consequences of the rule changes is that teams are sharing  safety information at an unprecedented level.
A leading Formula One designer, who declined to be identified, said the  teams were continuing secret negotiations with the FIA, to try to modify  further rules changes.
Among the information being exchanged by the teams were specifications for  extra bracing for the rear wings.
They will be under particularly heavy load on the twisting Barcelona  circuit as teams attempt to maximize cornering efficiency.
Further radical modifications are due to be imposed for the German Grand  Prix on July 31, when the FIA wants to impose rules set for the 1995 season.
These call for the cars to have "stepped" undersides to drastically cut  aerodynamic downforce and thus cornering speeds.
At least two teams have said they cannot meet the full demands of the FIA  and one said it would simply quit Formula One.
Keith Wiggins, owner of the small Pacific Grand Prix team which entered  Formula One this year, said the changes would force him out.
"All the teams, even the big ones where money is no object, would have  difficulty" building new cars," he said.
"We wouldn't even bother. We couldn't build a new car and we couldn't  afford it anyway."
Jordan's Gary Anderson agreed his team could not build new cars in time  for the German GP.
"It's too big a job," he said.
"I think there could be better ways to achieve the objectives without  involving such a drama for all the teams."
McLaren's Ron Dennis said the changes should have been put forward by  engineers.
The FIA has said it would consider other changes if they had the same or  better effect for increased safety and reduced performance, and met the same  time scale.
The teams have been meeting in secret to try to develop ideas acceptable  to the FIA but which they consider feasible.
