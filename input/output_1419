The PLO on Tuesday denied press reports that  Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak had called Yasser Arafat a "dog" for delaying  the signing of the May 4 self-rule accord with Israel.
"It's a lie," the PLO insisted in a statement.
Such reports were "part of an orchestrated campaign against the  Palestinians and their leadership at a time when the Palestinian national  authority is being set up" to run the self-rule areas of Gaza and Jericho.
Relations between Arafat and Mubarak are marked by "respect, trust and  brotherly warmth," the organisation said. The Palestinians and Egyptians had  "historic links."
Israeli and Western newspapers have said Mubarak lost his temper and  called Arafat a "dog," ordering him to put pen to paper "at once," after the  PLO chairman held up a signing ceremony for the launch of Palestinian  self-rule.
The ceremony, which fell on the president's birthday, was beamed live  across the world but interrupted for PLO, Israeli, US, Egyptian and Russian  leaders to go backstage in a last-minute row over details.
