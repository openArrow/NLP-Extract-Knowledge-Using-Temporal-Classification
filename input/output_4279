Williams-Renault have confirmed David  Coulthard as partner for Damon Hill in Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix here.
Coulthard, 23, the official Williams test driver since the start of the  season, effectively replaces three-times world champion Ayrton Senna who was  killed at Imola on May 1.
Coulthard said: "Obviously, I am delighted to be given this opportunity  which is every up-and-coming racing driver's dream.
"I have total confidence in the team and am looking forward to the race. I  will be out there to do the best job I can."
Frank Williams said: "David has proved an excellent test driver for the  team and impressed us with his skills during the many sessions he has  undertaken for us.
"He is a confident driver with a mature head and I am sure he will be an  excellent partner for Damon over the Spanish Grand Prix weekend."
