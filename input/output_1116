Former American tennis star Jennifer  Capriati was charged with being in possession of marijuana here Monday after  police found her in a hotel room after being tipped off about a 'runaway'  being there.
After being charged, the 18-year-old former world top-ten player was  released to her attorney John Ross.
Police officer Mitch Fry said that Capriati was found alone in the room  and a search uncovered the marijuana. Shortly afterwards a 17-year-old  reported runaway girl and a 19-year-old man pulled up outside the hotel in  Capriati's car.
They were also arrested on drug charges.
The girl, alleged to be in possession of two packets of heroine, was later  released to her parents.
The man, Tom Wineland of Key Biscayne, was suspected of having crack  cocaine and was being held on a 6,000 dollar bond at Dade County Jail.
It is the second time in less than a year that Capriati, who became the  youngest player ever to win a match at Wimbledon in 1990 and who reached the  semi-finals there the following year, has been in trouble with Florida police.
Last December she was accused in Tampa of shoplifting but let off with a  warning. Her agent claimed Capriati had inadvertently wandered off from a shop  during a shopping trip wearing a 15 dollar ring she hadn't paid for.
Capriati, who has not played on the professional tour since losing in the  first round of last year's United States Open, earned 1.5 million dollars in  prizemoney after turning professional in in her short career.
