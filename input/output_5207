Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin announced Sunday  that Israel was about to stop paying salaries to 25,000 Palestinian employees  and urged the PLO to confront its new financial responsibilities.
"The real problem is that the Palestinian police have not been paid,"  since the launch of self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho,  Rabin warned in an interview with BBC World Service radio.
"On the civilian side, mainly in Gaza, by the end of this month, we will  stop paying the 25,000 Gazans -- 7,000 employees of our civil administration  and 18,000 that we employed in public work," he said.
The prime minister said the Israeli military administration had been  paying out 10 million dollars per month, but the payments are to stop on  Tuesday.
"I don't see where the money will come from to sustain the 7,000  employees, most of whom are teachers, doctors, other public services. And I am  woried," said Rabin.
"The money has to come from donors who are committed to paying 2.4 billion  dollars in five years.
"But I am not aware that the machinery has been created between the donors  and the PLO on how the money will be channeled and accounted for," the prime  minister said.
"The real problem for the Palestinians is their leadership, which was  never in a position of responsibility. They don't know the meaning of  responsibility, to find jobs, food, housing, to solve problems in education.
"They don't understand that no democracy in the world ... will be able to  contribute without having the machinery and the system that will assure that  their money is given for the purposes that it was agreed," he said.
