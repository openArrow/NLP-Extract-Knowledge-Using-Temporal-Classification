Rejuvenated Italian star Gianni  Bugno underlined his comeback to the big time as he won the 185km third stage  of the Tour of Italy here on Tuesday.
Former double world champion Bugno broke away in the final two kilometres  during the climb towards Loreto to win by two seconds ahead of the chasing  pack, led in by compatriot Stefano Zanini.
Another Italian, Moreno Argentin, retained the overall leader's pink  jersey, seven seconds ahead of Bugno.
Miguel Indurain finished fifth.
The 30-year-old Bugno, who won the Tour of Italy in 1990, had a disastrous  1993 but relaunched his career by winning this season's Tour of Flanders  classic in a photo-finish ahead of Belgian Johan Museuuw.
The day began with the race judges revealing there had been a timing error  on the second stage and awarded world number one Miguel Indurain and Frenchman  Armand de Las Cuevas a six-second bonus.
