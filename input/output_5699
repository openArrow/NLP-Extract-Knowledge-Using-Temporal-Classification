European Union agricultural ministers agreed here  Tuesday to reinforce the fight against "mad cow disease", but rejected German  complaints that British beef could be unsafe because tainted with the disease.
British Agriculture Minister Gillian Shephard said Germany had received  "not one iota of support" from other countries or the EU's executive European  Commission for its efforts to ban imports of British beef.
German imports of British beef have plummeted over the past year because  of allegations that it has been unsafe for human consumption since an initial  outbreak of "mad cow" disease in Britain in 1985.
But Shephard said the campaign to ban British beef was motivated by  internal German politics ahead of national and regional elections there.
The commission has threatened to contest any formal German ban on British  beef at the European Court of Justice.
But EU Agriculture Commissioner Rene Steichen said at Tuesday's meeting  that the commission would do everything it could to ally public concerns.
The agriculture ministers endorsed commission proposals to ban the use of  animal proteins in animal feed in order to stop the spread of the disease,  known formally as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
They also agreed to pursue an investigation into the disease, to harmonise  health inspections throughout the EU's cattle industry and to tighten up other  regulations such as notifications of BSE outbreaks.
Shephard said Britain supported these proposals, adding that a ban on  sheep remains in cattle feed had been in force there since 1988.
The British minister added that Germany had produced no scientific  evidence to back its claim that British beef could pose a threat to human  health because it was tainted with BSE. "British beef is safe," she said.
