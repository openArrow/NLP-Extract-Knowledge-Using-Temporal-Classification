UN inspectors left for North Korea Sunday amid  reports that Pyongyang has gone ahead with a controversial replacement of  reactor fuel rods, the International Atomic Energy Agency said.
The agency had said the inspectors would not make the trip unless the  reclusive Stalinist state agreed to postpone the fuel rod replacement. But on  Saturday the agency said it was not clear if the process had begun and wanted  to see for itself.
