The gunmen released four more hostages at dawn Friday after receiving four  million dollars in ransom, the general said.
Shortly after that, they released five more hostages in exchange for a  further four million dollars.
Two interior ministry swat teams were flown in Thursday evening. First  Deputy Premier Oleg Soskovets and Interior Minister Viktor Yerin were jointly  running operations from the interior ministry, sources at the ministry said.
The drama began Thursday afternoon when the gunmen hijacked the bus near  Mineralnoye Vody as it travelled from the North Ossetian city of Vladikavkaz  en route to the southern Russian city of Stavropol.
The authorities allowed the bus to approach the town's airport, where  officials earlier said some 800 troops were deployed, surrounded by police  vehicles, according to Tetereviatnikov.
During the afternoon the hostage-takers released the 15 children they were  holding along with 23 adults in an operation staggered over several hours,  Tetereviatnikov told AFP.
The hostage-taking was the fourth to occur in the region in the past five  years.
The last hostage drama occurred last December when 15 schoolchildren were  abducted in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-the-Don.
The four-man gang obtained a helicopter and led authorities on a four-day  airborne pursuit through the Caucasus before releasing their hostages one by  one in return for 10 million dollars in ransom, most of which was recovered.
