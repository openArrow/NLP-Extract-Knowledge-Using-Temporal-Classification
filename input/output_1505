The government of this island state of Vanuatu  will face a no-confidence motion alleging corruption and breaches of codes of  conduct, officials said Wednesday.
Parliamentary officials said they had received a written no-confidence  motion which would be heard after a minimum of seven days' sittings in the  next session, which starts Thursday.
Opposition leader Donald Kalpokas said Tuesday the motion was forced by  the  alleged bribery of members of parliament, breaches of ministerial codes  of conduct and government plans to abolish the 11 local councils and replace  them with four provinces.
All four opposition parties had supported the motion against the Union of  Moderate Parties government of Prime Minister Maxime Carlot, which holds 25  out of the 46 parliamentary seats.
The opposition comprises the Vanuaaku Pati with nine seats, the National  United Party with seven, the Melanesian Progressive Party with four, and the  Tan Union with one.
