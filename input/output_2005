More than 500 people were rescued as a fire swept  through a Red Sea ferry off the Egyptian coast on Thursday, leaving five  people dead and around 20 missing, officials said.
The Qamar al-Saudi was sailing from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to Suez, in  Egypt, when an explosion in the engine room shortly before midnight caused the  blaze which spread rapidly, rescue services said.
Regional governor Abdel Meneim Said said 563 people had been saved, five  had died and the remainder of the 589 passengers and crew were missing. Around  50 of those rescued had been injured.
Soon after the ship caught fire, two American warships, and an Egyptian  minesweeper raced to the scene.
Another eight tug boats belonging to oil companies in the region also  joined the operation, rescue workers said.
Some of the survivors were initially taken to oil platforms.
The "fire has completely gutted the ship," said rescue official Ahmed  Nabil, from the Egyptian Red Sea port of Hurghada.
Most of those on board were Egyptian workers returning home for the Moslem  feast of Eid.
Shortly before the blast the ferry had dropped 527 passengers at the  Egyptian Red Sea port of Safaga, 600 kilometres (370 miles) southeast of Cairo  and entered the Gulf of Suez.
The Qamar-al-Saudi had already hit a reef in March in the same stretch of  water but nobody was hurt. It had also collided with a Norwegian ship in 1991.
In December 1991 another ferry on the same route, the Salem Express, hit a  coral reef off the Egyptian coast, officially causing the deaths of 471,  although more were believed to have been lost.
