Al Unser Jnr gave his father a  priceless birthday gift Sunday, extending their family's legendary racing  legacy with a victory in the Indianapolis 500.
Pole-sitting Unser won his second race here in three years after a  heart-breaking crash eliminated leader Emerson Fittipaldi 16 laps from the  finish. The Brazilian racer had led 145 laps.
"Emerson was the strongest player out there, but everything just worked  out for me," Unser Jnr said. "Winning Indy is what I love more than anything  and I was glad to give dad the only birthday present he really wanted."
His father, Al Unser Snr, is a four-time Indy winner who turned 55 Sunday.  He retired from racing 12 days ago after his car proved uncompetitive. Al  Jnr's uncle, Bobby Unser, won three Indy titles, so Sunday's triumph was the  family's ninth here.
"This is a birthday present I'll never forget," the elder Unser said.
Fittipaldi dominated before crashing in the fourth turn trying to lap  Unser, his Penske Racing teammate. The Brazilian racer finished 17th.
"It's very disappointing," Fittiapldi said. "I was in total control of the  race."
The drama was similar to the 1989 race, when Unser Jnr and Fittipaldi  touched on the next-to-last lap around the 2.5-mile (4km) oval. Fittipaldi  kept control and won. Unser skidded into the outer wall and was second.
"I saw where Emerson had hit and said, 'There's Emmo.' Dad said, 'See, it  all comes back to you at this place.' And it's true."
Seven crashes marred the race, keeping the average speed to a relatively  slow 160.872 mph (257.395 km/h). Unser's winning time of three hours, six  minutes and 29 seconds was 8.6 seconds ahead of runner-up Jacques Villeneuve.  The race finished under caution conditions after a late wreck.
