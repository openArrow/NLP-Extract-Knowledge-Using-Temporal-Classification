The European Union Wednesday issued a statement  expressing full support for the territorial integrity of Ukraine, five days  after the Crimean parliament adopted a separatist constitution.
In the statement, the EU "expresses its grave concern at the recent  developments in the Crimean region of Ukraine."
"Noting that the situation has deteriorated over the past week and taking  into consideration the decision of the Crimean Parliament of May 20, it urges  the continuation of efforts to find negotiated and legitimate solutions to the  issue, without resort to confrontation or unilateral actions," the statement  said.
"The EU reiterates that an escalation of the conflict would have severe  consequences for the stability in Eastern Europe," it added.
