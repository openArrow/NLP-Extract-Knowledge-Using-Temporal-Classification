Libya on Monday officially restored the Aouzou  Strip, a tract of desert territory believed to be rich in minerals, to Chad  after a 22-year occupation, Chadian radio reported.
The handover took place as planned at Aouzou, a post in the territory of  114,000 square kilometres (45,600 square miles) which had led to war between  the two nations in the past, the radio said.
But it gave no details, citing an almost total lack of communications with  the remote site.
The lowering of the Libyan flag in the Aouzou Strip and the transfer to  Chad follows a February 3 ruling by the International Court of Justice in the  Hague, upholding Ndjamena's claim to the area.
Guests invited to the ceremony by the Chadian government, notably French  troops and representatives of relief agencies, were flown to Bardai, about 100  kilometres (60 miles) from Aouzou, aboard French military planes, diplomatic  sources in Ndjamena said.
France deployed a military air and ground force in Chad in 1986, known as  Operation Epervier (Sparrowhawk), to put an end to Libyan military offensives.  The force is currently some 800 strong.
The programme for Monday's ceremony stated that it would be attended by  Libyan Justice Minister Mohammad Hijazi, Chadian Interior Minister Abderamane  Izzo and an official of the UN observer team that monitored Libya's withdrawal.
