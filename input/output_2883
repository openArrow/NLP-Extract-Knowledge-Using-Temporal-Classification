Malaysia's national power firm Tenaga  Nasional is to go on a US fund-raising tour next month to secure some 13  billion ringgit (5.2 billion US dollars) in expenditure capital for the next  three years, officials said Sunday.
The "American Roadshow" will take Tenaga to Washington, New York and other  major cities in the United States, with the aim of raising money through the  issue of bonds, the officials said.
"Our idea is to eventually reduce our overseas loans," Ani Arope,  executive chairman of Tenaga, said, adding that the company wanted to achieve  a 40 percent local and 60 percent foreign loan mix.
Tenaga posted a total debt value of 5.3 billion ringgit for fiscal 1993,  while forecasting about 11 billion ringgit in capital expenditure until 1995.
The power firm said last year that it was considering raising funds  through the issue of Samurai bonds, Eurobonds, Yankee bonds and Dragon bonds.
