Mexico's Attorney General's office announced  Tuesday it had begun a nationwide reorganization of the federal Judicial  Police, now under fire for alleged corruption and abuse of authority.
The attorney general's office said in a statement that in order to  safeguard public security, it was clamping down on renegade groups inside the  federal ranks and eliminating the federal force's General Operations  Coordinator. The coordinator's five directors were fired.
The initiative will effect several states and "put an end to pernicious  elements" and identify individuals who have abused authority, the office said  in a statement.
News of the overhaul came just hours after the new archbishop of  Guadalajara, Juan Sandoval, complained to reporters that the attorney  general's office had been infiltrated by drug traffickers.
"That is why they have not got to the bottom of the killing of Cardinal  Juan Jesus Posadas," he claimed.
Posadas was shot dead exactly a year ago outside the Guadalajara airport.
Sandoval alleged that drug-money corruption of the attorney general's  office was behind authorities' failure to capture the Arellano Felix brothers,  leaders of the Tijuana drug cartel allegedly behind the killing of the  cardinal, who is believed to have been mistaken for alleged rival drug boss  Joaquin "Chapo" Guzman.
Gunmen pumped 14 bullets into Posadas May 24, 1993, apparently in a clash  between rival drug gangs. Sandoval charged that when authorities were close to  nabbing the killers, judicial police warned them and allowed them to escape.
