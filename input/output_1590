This southern bastion echoed to the thunder of  artillery on Wednesday as fighting between rival Yemeni forces moved markedly  closer, an AFP correspondent reported.
It was the first time the sound of battle could be heard so clearly in the  port city of Aden, stronghold of Vice-President Ali Salem Baid, whose forces  are fighting off a northern offensive.
And it triggered fear among the population of 500,000, who had been  reassured only the night before that the southerners were keeping the  offensive at bay.
Remaining foreigners crowded the port trying to board an Indian and a  Pakistani ship which were due to set sail. Nearly 280 Indians were scheduled  to leave during the day, a port official said.
Northern troops, loyal to President Ali Abdallah Saleh, are locked in a  bitter struggle with Baid's forces at Al-Anad, a strategically important air  base 50 kilometers (30 miles) to the north of Aden.
There also fighting at Zinjibar, to the east, and Kharaz, to the west.
Artillery fire could be heard near the city on Wednesday to both the north  and east.
Baid's Yemeni Socialist Party has stepped up conscription, taking  thousands of youths to the front, willingly or not, aboard party vehicles that  were criss-crossing the city.
Saleh has rejected international appeals for a ceasefire and insists that  Baid and his aids surrender or flee into exile.
The civil war was about to enter its third week with no end in sight.
It has shattered the uneasy four-year old union between the conservative  North and Marxist South.
