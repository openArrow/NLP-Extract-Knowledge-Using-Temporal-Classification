Ireland's hopes of upsetting world rugby union  champions Australia next month nosedived here Sunday with a 55-18 mauling by  New South Wales.
The provincial side dominated from the start in unseasonably warm  conditions, piling on eight tries.
But Australian captain Phil Kearns expects Ireland to be better prepared  and much more aggressive in the two-Test series, starting on June 5.
"Test matches are different to anything else," said the NSW hooker.
"We treated today's match very seriously, it was a big game for us and we  have a good record against touring sides ... perhaps they were looking more to  the tests.
"I expect a big performance from them in the tests. They beat England in  the Five Nations, so they have to be a fair side. They will be used to the  heat, so they will be a lot more aggressive.
"They've also got a few guys in their side renowned for the rough stuff.  They will be far more aggressive.
"A lot of the other British sides that have come out here have tried it  on ... the Lions have done it, the Welsh have tried to do it both here and  overseas, so I don't see any reason why the Irish won't try the same thing."
New South Wales, who led 27-6 at half-time, were too well organised in  the forwards and brimming with backline talent.
Star winger David Campese scored two tries while fly half Tim Wallace  contributed 15 points from six conversions and a penalty.
Ireland managed only two tries, one of which was converted by fly-half  Eric Elwood, who also added two penalties.
The Irish next play the Australian Capital Territory in Canberra on  Wednesday before facing Super Ten champions Queensland in Brisbane next Sunday.
