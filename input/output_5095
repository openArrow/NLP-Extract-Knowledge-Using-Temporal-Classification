Some 400,000 Rwandans are fleeing south from the  Rwandan capital Kigali, following the advance of the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan  Patriotic Front, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said here  Sunday.
"They have nothing to eat and nothing to drink. It is a very grave  situation," said ICRC spokesman Tony Burgener.
The exodus into a region already overburdened by previous waves of  refugees from the fighting is causing huge problems for the ICRC's aid  operations.
The ICRC said that following the latest wave of evacuations, Kigali was  now practically empty of civilians.
