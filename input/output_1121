Capriati officially left the tour because of an elbow injury but many felt  she was showing classic signs of 'burn-out.'
In January she made it clear she didn't intend to return to the game until  she graduated from High School and despite a statement in March from her  father and coach, Stefano Capriati, who said she might stage a return for the  forthcoming French Open, it was quickly clear Capriati herself was not  enthusiastic about the idea.
The current issue of Sports Illustrated quotes Capriati as saying: "I'm  having fun."
The magazine said it interviewed the her at Florida Atlantic University in  Boca Raton and that Capriati had said she had left her parents to live with  friends.
"It's better with them than up where I was living," she is reported as  saying.
Capriati's agent made no immediate comment after hearing Monday's news
