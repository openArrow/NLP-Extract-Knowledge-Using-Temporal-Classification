Michael Stich saved two match points  on his way to upsetting Pete Sampras 3-6 7-6 (9/7) 6-2 and give Germany the  lead over the United States at the World Team Cup.
It was the world number one's first defeat in 30 matches, but he failed to  take his chances and paid the price agaist a more resilient opponent.
The outcome was a surprise, because although Stich was never outclassed he  looked second best for much of the match.
Sampras hit the ball more crisply and controlled the net. He also had the  crowd roaring when he hit the ball around the net post and then raced across  court to send a perfect forehand flashing down the line. In contrast, Stich  sometimes looked casual.
Sampras had broken serve with a crosscourt backhand to lead 3-2 in the  second set and held a match point at 5-3 when Stich put a backhand wide under  no pressure.
But Sampras hit his return on Stich's second serve into the net and the  German broke back to 5-5 when his shot hit the net cord and trickled over.
Sampras held a second match point in the tiebreak when Stich nettted a  return at 5-5. Serving to save the match, Stich's nerves were stretched when a  string broke on his first serve, but Sampras again netted a second service  return.
Stich took firm control at last in the final set as Sampras often mis-hit,  was slow to the ball and had no depth on his shots, allowing Stich to pick off  easy winners.
He broke for 1-0 when Sampras netted a poor return and, although the  American held two break points for 2-2, he was denied by a fine crosscourt  forehand from Stich and another poor service return.
Stich extended his lead by breaking for 5-2 with a confident forehand  volley and his tenth ace gave him match point.
A forehand winner then gave him victory after 1hr 56mins.
Cedric Pioline gave France a 1-0 lead over Russia when he beat Alexander  Volkov 6-3 6-4.
