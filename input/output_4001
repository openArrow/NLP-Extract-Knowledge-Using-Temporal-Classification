Russian mafia organizations already deal in  low-grade nuclear materials and may be poised to get their hands on nuclear  arms and weapons-grade nuclear materials, the FBI director said Wednesday.
The gangs, which have grown rapidly since the breakup of the Soviet Union,  "may already have the capability to steal nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons  components or weapons-grade nuclear materials," FBI Director Louis Freeh said.
Although there have been a significant number of reported thefts of  low-grade material, authorities do not yet know of any cases involving  weapons-grade materials.
It is likely that "Russian and Eurasian crime groups will view these  materials as a desirable form of contraband to be offered for sale to the  highest bidder," Freeh said in testimony before a Senate subcommittee.
He said he would undertake a fact-finding mission in Eastern Europe and  Russia next month. While in Moscow he will also open the FBI's first permanent  office in the former Soviet Union.
Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the subcommittee on permanent  investigations, called gangs in the former Soviet Union "a potential national  security nightmare."
Freeh said Russian organized crime in the United States has grown  significantly since the end of the Soviet Union. FBI racketeering  investigations involving Russian or Eurasian gangs have grown from 13 two  years ago to 35 early this year.
