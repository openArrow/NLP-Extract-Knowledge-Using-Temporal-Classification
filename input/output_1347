Fighting between rival troops from northern and  southern Yemen was continuing to prevent the distribution of aid to some 6,000  Somalis at a refugee camp near Aden, a UNHCR spokesman said Tuesday.
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees had said Sunday that the refugees at  the Al Koud camp, some 50 kilometres (30 miles) from Aden, were caught in the  crossfire. Some 175 of them had been killed and many others injured.
The UNHCR, which is cooperating with the International Committee of the  Red Cross and the medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres, is trying to  negotiate a ceasefire in order to bring in relief aid and to evacuate  refugees, the spokesman said.
