A UN Security Council statement late  Wednesday called on all the warring parties in Bosnia to reach a prompt,  negotiated solution to their conflict without any preconditions.
Speaking for all 15 members, this month's council president Ibrahim  Gambari of Nigeria reiterated the pressing need to halt the bloodshed  throughout Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The statement came as representatives of the Bosnian Moslems, Croats and  Serbs negotiated behind closed doors in Talloires, southeastern France, with  the international contact group on Bosnia - European Union, Russia and the  United States.
The Security Council also called on all the Bosnian factions to  immediately and fully comply with resolution 913 passed earlier this month  establishing a no-fire zone around Gorazde, in eastern Bosnia.
The council members urged the warring parties to cooperate fully with the  United Nations Protection Force.
