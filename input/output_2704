Seventeen people were killed in the northern  Indian state of Kashmir overnight, a day after Pakistani troops allegedly  fired rockets at a television tower, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported  Saturday.
Ten Moslem militants and two security troopers were among those killed  since Friday evening in separate gunbattles linked to the secessionist drive  in the turbulent Himalayan province, a government spokesman told PTI.
Three other people were were killed in two separate incidents when  militants stopped buses and ordered passengers out and then shot them. Two  other unrest-related deaths were also reported.
The spokesman also accused Pakistani troops of firing four rockets at a  television relay centre in the border district of Poonch on Thursday, all of  which missed the target.
Kashmiri Moslem rebels and Pakistani soldiers also fired about 158 rockets  late Thursday in Poonch and the adjoining Rajouri district but there were no  casualties, he said.
"The main aim of the Pakistanis and the homesick militants was to create  panic and to boost the sagging morale of the militants fighting a losing  battle with (Indian) security forces in Kashmir," he told the news agency.
Nearly 9,000 people have died in Kashmir since 1989, when Moslem rebels  stepped up a bloody drive against Indian rule. India accuses neighbouring  Pakistan of fomenting militancy but Islamabad denies the charge.
