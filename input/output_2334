Former Japanese foreign minister Masayoshi Ito, a  veteran member of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), died of pneumonia at his  Tokyo home Friday morning, party officials said. He was 80.
The former lower house legislator was seen as a symbol of political  reformists at the LDP, which lost the majority in lower house general  elections last year following a series of financial scandals. He will also be  remembered for pursuing friendship between Japan and China.
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata expressed his condolences, describing him as a  "selfless patriot."
Ito served as chief cabinet secretary in 1979-1980 under then prime  minister Masayoshi Ohira. After the sudden death of Ohira in June 1980, he  served as acting prime minister until July 1980. He then became foreign  minister in 1980-1981 under prime minister Zenko Suzuki.
After Noboru Takeshita resigned as prime minister in 1989 to take  responsibility for his alleged involvement in Recruit Co. stocks-for-favors  scandal, LDP offered Ito the post of premier because of his clean image, but  he turned it down.
Ito visited China a number of times as chairman of a non-partisan  parliamentarian's league for Japan-China friendship.
