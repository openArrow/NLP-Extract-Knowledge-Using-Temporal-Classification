US long-range nuclear missiles are no longer  being aimed at the former Soviet Union, officials said Tuesday.
Pentagon spokesman Kathleen deLaski said the move was a symbolic gesture  but also a major step following the end of the Cold War.
DeLaski said the retargetting was part of an agreement between Russia and  the United States as a confidence-building measure between the two governments.
The missiles can be reprogrammed quickly in the event of a crisis, she  added.
The US Trident and Peacekeeper missiles will have no targetting  information, but some older missiles will be aimed out to sea, the spokeswoman  said.
