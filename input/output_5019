Fly-half Christophe Deylaud inspired Toulouse to a  22-16 win over Montferrand in the French championship final here on Saturday.
It was the club's 11th championship trophy.
The 29-year-old Deylaud, preferred to ditched Five Nations number ten  Alain Penaud in France's party to tour Canada and New Zealand, celebrated with  two massive drop goals and three penalties in front of 48,000 spectators.
Montferrand's international winger Philippe Saint-Andre played a crucial  part in his side's only try, taking a flicked one-handed pass from Fabien  Bertrank to set up number eight Christophe Juillet with an inside pass.
That score came after his side had been under severe pressure in the  second half but Toulouse responded immediately, a bungled up-and-under being  hacked on by Emile N'Tamack for scrum-half Jerome Cazalbou to win the race to  the touchdown.
