Non-Hogkin's lymphoma, which is in fact a term <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">used</EVENT> for a variety of lymph  node malignancies, is also among the most curable forms of cancer, <EVENT eid="e4" class="REPORTING" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">according</EVENT>  to medical experts.&#13;
"It is one of the most treatable of all human cancers," <EVENT eid="e5" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT> Dr. Bruce  Cheson of the National Cancer Institute. "Some forms, even though treatable,  are incurable. Other forms that are more aggressive are also quite curable, if  <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">treated</EVENT> appropriately."&#13;
Over <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION">the past three decades</TIMEX3>, the United States has <EVENT eid="e7" class="PERCEPTION" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">seen</EVENT> a 60 percent <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">rise</EVENT>  in non-Hogkin's lymphoma, more than all cancers but a few such as melanoma. It  most frequently <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">strikes</EVENT> people in their 50s.&#13;
Overall, however, its incidence is far lower than cancers of the lung,  breast and colon, which are the deadliest forms of cancer.&#13;

The malignancy <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">differs</EVENT> from Hodgkin's disease, another lymph node cancer,  by the structure and organization of the cancer cells.&#13;
Patients with non-Hodgkins lymphoma often <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">respond</EVENT> well to chemotherapy,  although the disease usually <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">recurs</EVENT> in a number of years. In some cases, the  cancer can <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="can">spread</EVENT> quickly and be fatal within <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION">weeks</TIMEX3>.&#13;
Some patients with an aggressive form of the cancer are <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">cured</EVENT> with bone  marrow transplants, although this too is not always effective.&#13;
