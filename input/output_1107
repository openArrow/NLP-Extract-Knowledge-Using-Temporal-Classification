The United States again Monday blocked the  deployment of 5,500 UN troops to Rwanda to protect refugees who have fled  genocidal massacres over the past five weeks, western diplomats said.
The United States blocked a Friday vote on the deployment and has since  presented nine amendments to the deployment resolution, conditioning the  expansion of the UN troops' mandate on availability of resources and the  consent of the parties to the conflict.
The US delegation has been lobbying the United Nations to proceed in  stages, most importantly placing military observers in Rwanda before sending  peacekeepers in order to evaluate needs and obtain better intelligence, the  sources said.
The Security Council is expected to discuss Rwanda again Monday, but no  vote is expected before Tuesday.
The proposed US amendments clash with recommendations made last week by UN  Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who urged the Security Council last  week to dispatch 5,500 peacekeeping troops. Some delegations showed impatience  Monday over the lengthy delays as the killing and refugee flows continue.
In a statement issued in New York, Human Rights Watch/Africa criticized  the United States Monday for putting off the vote set for last Friday. "Delay  costs more lives," the group said.
The United States has proposed creating humanitarian zones on the Rwandan  border but Boutros-Ghali has warned that the zones would attract non-refugees  from areas unaffected by the war.
