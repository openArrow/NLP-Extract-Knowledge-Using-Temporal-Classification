Queensland became the Super 10 rugby  union champions with a convincing 21-10 victory Natal at Kings Park here on  Saturday.
But they were forced to pay a heavy price, with Australian international  centre pairing Tim Horan and Jason Little (knee injuries) and Wallaby flanker  Illie Tabua (ribs) all forced off the field.
Queensland, who led 12-0 at halftime, withstood second half pressure from  the home side before eventually coasting home through tries by winger Barry  Lea and number eight Sam Scott-Young.
Natal responded with a solitary second-half try from Natal left wing  Cabous van der Westhuizen.
Queensland skipper Peter Slattery said: "They came back well in the second  half. There were certain stages when I didn't think we would do it."
But with Natal only two points back at 10-12, Wallaby fly-half Michale  Lynagh slotted a superb drop goal to stretch the score to 15-10.
Lynagh, who ruled much of the game with intelligent kicking, also  converted the Scott-Young try and was successful with two penalties for a  personal points tally of 11.
For Natal, fullback Joubert converted the lone try but otherwise had an  unhappy day with his kicking, landing only one penalty from six attempts.
Natal made far too many mistakes -- two penalties given away in the final  minutes -- and suffered badly in the line-out.
Natal scorers:
Try: Cabous van der Westhuizen. Conversion: Andre Joubert. Penalty:  Joubert.
Queensland scorers:
Tries: Barry Lea, Sam Scott-Young. Conversion: Michael Lynagh. Penalties:  Michael Lynagh (2). Drop-goal: Lynagh.
