Russia's special envoy to ex-Yugoslavia Vitaly  Churkin headed to Belgrade Tuesday in a new bid to restart peace talks prior  to negotiations set to resume this week in Geneva, the Russian embassy here  announced.
Churkin is expected to return to Zagreb later in the day to meet with  Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, presidential spokesperson Vesna  Skare-Ozbolt said.
A spokesman at the Russian embassy here said he did not know whether  Churkin, who arrived in Zagreb Monday, would meet with Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic.
UN special envoy to ex-Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi last week called on  Bosnia's three warring factions -- Moslems, Croats and Serbs -- to attend  peace negotiations in Geneva on Thursday and Friday.
Churkin is expected to attend these talks along with his American  counterpart Charles Redman and peace mediators Thorvald Stoltenberg, of the  United Nations, and David Owen, of the European Union.
