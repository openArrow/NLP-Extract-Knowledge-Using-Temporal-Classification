UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali  recommended Thursday that the United Nations clearly define the boundaries  around the six designated safe areas in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
In a report to the Security Council released Thursday, the secretary  general also said that UN Protection Forces have been stretched to the limit  and should not be asked to establish more safe havens in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The United Nations should define precise boundaries for the six existing  safe areas of Sarajevo, Srebrenica, Tuzla, Zepa, Gorazde and Bihac,  Boutros-Ghali said.
Brcko had been proposed as another site for a safe area.
The United Nations established the six safe zones about 18 months ago to  protect Bosnian Moslem populations concentrated in those areas from relentless  Bosnian Serbian attack.
The difficulty in using already overburdened peacekeeping forces to  establish the zones and protect the population makes safe havens a temporary  solution and precludes the United Nations from creating more of them, he said.
"UNPROFOR, overstretched and underresourced as it is in relation to its  current mandates, does not have the capacity to rush from crisis to crisis in  different areas.
"It is neither configured nor equipped for mandates to fight or to hold  ground," he said, adding that it is designed for quick deployment rather than  fixed position.
"These factors dictate clear limits to the concept of safe areas," he  stressed.
He also pointed to a recent council resolution demanding a halt to all  provocative action in security zones, a demand apparently aimed at Bosnian  Moslems who have recently been accused of violating rules governing the safe  areas.
"It must be recognized that safe areas do not in themselves represent a  long-term solution to the fundamental conflict in Bosnia and Hercegovina,  which requires a political and territorial solution," he said.
