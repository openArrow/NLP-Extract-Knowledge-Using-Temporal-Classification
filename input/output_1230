ASEAN labour ministers announced their  determination here on Tuesday to fight western demands to give higher wages to  workers in return for freer trade.
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations ministers said they would ask  the International Labour Organisation to resist attempts by developed nations  to include social clauses in agreements giving access to new markets.
The six-nation bloc is one of the world's high growth areas. But it has  been criticised in some industrialised nations for making unfair use of a huge  supply of low wage labour.
At the end of a two-day meeting, the ministers said international pressure  would be resisted.
They said in a closing statement: "Such attempts would undermine the  competitiveness of developing countries and erode their comparative advantages  thereby hurting their economies."
The statement reiterated the position taken by senior ASEAN officials at  talks in Washington last week. They told American counterparts they would  fight any bid by the United States to link trade to labour welfare and human  rights.
Leaders of developing countries see social clauses to improve the welfare  of poorly paid workers and stop forced and child labour as little more than  disguised protectionism.
ASEAN officials say the new focus on labour conditions is aimed at forcing  wages up in developing countries so industrial nations can compete against  cheap imports.
