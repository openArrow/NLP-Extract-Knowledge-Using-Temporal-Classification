Vietnam has ordered ailing state firms to start  making arrangements to repay their debts by July 1 or face bankruptcy, a  report said Tuesday.
A directive from Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet accused many state businesses  of dragging their feet in implementing government reforms aimed at clearing  debts between the firms, the Saigon Newsreader reported.
Debtors "should make use of all available capital soures, including cash,  assets, houses, machinery and equipment to settle debts that have been  acknowleged," the directive said.
After July 1, all enterprises that refuse to settle debts would be treated  under the bankruptcy law, it said.
The parent ministries or government offices in charge of any enterprises  already dissolved should take responsibility for the debts, the prime minister  said, but efforts to force them to do so in the past have been mostly  unsuccessful.
Government estimates put the total amount of debt between state firms at  900 million dollars, but only about 50 million dollars has been settled so far  despite intense government pressure to resolve the issue.
Only about half the 12,000 state firms registered three years ago are  still functioning with the rest either bankrupt or merged into solvent firms  as part of the government's move to stem the haemorrhage of losses.
Whilst trying to ease the burden of the state sector, the government has  been wary about closing down loss making enterprises, fearing that a large  rise in unemployment would create social unrest.
