Meanwhile in Frankfurt the German Lufthansa airline, which is partly owned  by the German state, said it was also interested in obtaining landing rights  at Orly. Company president Juergen Weber told an annual press conference on  company results that "clearly we are also interested in serving Orly".
He said: "We also want to land there. It will not be today, nor tomorrow,  but perhaps the day after tomorrow."
He expressed satisfaction that the European airline industry was being  de-regulated.
In Paris, French Transport Minister Bernard Bosson said that a strike by  employees of the Air Inter airline called on Tuesday to protest against  liberalisation was "understandable but is not the solution" to the airline's  problems.
Air Inter is a subsidiary of Air France.
Bosson said that trades unions were "fighting against decisions taken in  Brussels years ago by former governments".
He said: "It is not this government which took ultra-liberal decisions. We  are inheriting them. Today we are doing everything to organise managed  competition."
He told a meeting of the confederation of small and medium-sized companies  that: "We object to ultra liberalism, British for the most part, which is  rampant in Brussels."
