Two Frenchmen spurned by the same woman  committed suicide this weekend at the same time, in the same place and with  the same weapon -- a magnum 357 revolver, judicial sources said.
The woman's lover, 52-year-old Gerard Blondel, shot himself in the heart  outside her home in the tiny hamlet of Chapelle Saint-Mesmin in central France  on Sunday afternoon because she decided to end their affair.
As the shot went off, her husband Maurice Legout, aged 42, ran out of the  house, grabbed the weapon and also shot himself through the heart.
The sources said the two men, who were old friends, were both suffering  from severe nervous depression. Autopsies carried out on the corpses on Monday  confirmed both cases were suicides.
