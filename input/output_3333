US and Japanese negotiators met here twice  Monday and said they might meet again for a third time before the end of the  day in efforts to break a three-month deadlock in bilateral trade talks.
"We may meet again today," Japanese deputy foreign minister for economic  affairs Sakayuki Hayashi said as he left the offices of the United States  Trade Representative (USTR) for the second time.
Hayashi said he hoped the talks could be wound up Monday, but said they  might have to meet against Tuesday.
The two sides have now met seven times since Thursday in talks that were  originally scheduled to last just one day.
They are trying to agree ground rules for a resumption of trade talks that  broke down in February in disagreement over how to measure progress in opening  Japan's markets and reducing its 60 billion dollars trade surplus with the  United States.
Shortly after the Japanese delegation left, Economic Policy advisor to the  president Robert Rubin arrived and, asked if he was there to discuss the trade  talks would say only: "I am here to see ambassador (Mickey) Kantor," the US  Trade Representative
