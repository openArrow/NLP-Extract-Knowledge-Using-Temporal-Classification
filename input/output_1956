Australia's biggest company, BHP Co.  Ltd., on Thursday forecast record steel production for the year to May 31 of  7.5 million tonnes.
Managing director John Prescott forecast about 40 percent of the year's  steel production would be exported.
Meanwhile, BHP released its April production report which showed raw steel  production had risen 14 percent in April to 667,230 tonnes.
Prescott said the steel division was a key element in BHP's offshore  growth and heavy investment in the mid-1980s had resulted in secure markets.
"The benefits of that expansion are now flowing through to our Australian  operations," he told a business lunch here.
Raw steel production reached 6.65 million tonnes for the year to May 31,  1993, up 6.0 percent on the previous year.
Total raw production for the 11 months to April was 6.9 million tonnes  compared with 6.01 million tonnes in the previous corresponding period.
Elsewhere, BHP reported that iron ore production for the 11 months to  April 1994 rose 13 percent over the previous corresponding period.
However, production of clean coal was down 9.0 percent on the previous 11  months due to losses from industrial action and planned shut downs for  maintenance work.
BHP shares closed at 18.00 dollars each, 16 cents below Wednesday's finish  in a generally weak market.
