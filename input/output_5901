Forces opposing Afghan president Burhanuddin  Rabbani sent rockets crashing into Kabul Tuesday for the second day in a row,  killing six people and wounding 15, state-run Radio Kabul said.
More than 195 rockets were fired from southern posts held by forces loyal  to the president's rival, prime minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, according to the  broadcast monitored here.
On Monday, the radio had reported a four-hour barrage during which 131  rockets hit different parts of the Afghan capital, killing four and injuring  six people.
Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami militia and ethnic Uzbek forces loyal to former  communist general Abdul Rashid Dostam have been fighting since January to oust  Rabbani from power.
The five months of hostilities have left more than 2,500 people dead and  more than 17,000 injured.
