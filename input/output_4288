The Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe (CSCE) is deeply concerned about Crimea's recent move for greater  autonomy from the Ukraine, a CSCE communique issued here Thursday said.
It added that the CSCE's permanent committee, which meets here weekly,  wants to see a negotiated settlement to the political crisis sparked last week  after Crimea's parliament passed a resolution to implement a 1922  constitution, a move seen as tantamount to a declaration of independence from  Kiev.
The committee called on authorities in the Ukraine and Crimea to seek a  mutually agreeable settlement to the crisis and offered to send a  representative to act as mediator.
The Ukrainian parliament has declared the Crimean independence move  "illegal" and has given the local legislature up until Monday to reverse its  decision.
