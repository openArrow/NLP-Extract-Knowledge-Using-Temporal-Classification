Hundreds of Jewish settlers protested against  any Israeli pullout from the Golan Heights here Tuesday, as Prime Minister  Yitzhak Rabin met US Secretary of State Warren Christopher to discuss peace  with Syria.
"Rabin traitor! Rabin resign!" shouted the settlers from the annexed Golan  and occupied West Bank, backed by right-wing militants.
Mounted police dispersed the protesters when they tried to push their way  through the police checkpoint in front of the prime minister's residence.
The protest took place as Christopher, on a peace shuttle mission between  the two countries, met Rabin to discuss the Golan Heights, which Israel seized  from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
Israel has offered a phased withdrawal from the Golan linked to security  arrangements in return for total peace.
