President Joaquin Balaguer seems closer to  being re-elected for a seventh term, as partial results from Monday's general  elections put him ahead of his nearest rival by a 44-40 percent margin.
Trailing behind 87-year-old Balaguer and opposition candidate Jose  Francisco Pena Gomez, 57, was former president Juan Bosch, 81, with 13 percent  of the vote, the Central Election Board said with 62 percent of the vote count  in.
Pena Gomez, of the Dominican Revolutionary Party, and other opposition  leaders have publicly charged the board with election fraud, prompting the  police to take positions Tuesday around the capital to deter unrest.
The charges were potentially explosive. Though the voting went without  incident, 30 people were killed in election-related violence during the  campaign.
Pena Gomez said Tuesday that 200,000 opposition supporters were unable to  vote after their names had been stricken from voting lists by the election  board and replaced with fictitious names.
Three truckloads of heavily armed police were seen near Pena Gomez's  campaign headquarters here as he addressed a news conference.
Bosch also alleged the vote was unfair: "Fraud is the normal thing in the  Dominican Republic, in the current situation...these are not really legitimate  elections."
Balaguer has not responded directly to the fraud allegations, but said  late Monday that he did not think fraud was possible. "Everyone will be  satisfied with the way the process has been carried out," he said.
