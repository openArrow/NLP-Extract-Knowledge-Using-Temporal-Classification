A high level two-man mission from the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) left Vienna Sunday for North Korea to discuss the  controversial refuelling of a nuclear reactor.
Their departure was announced by an agency spokesman, who said they were  due to arrive in North Orea Tuesday.
They will work out inspection procedures with three IAEA inspectors who  have been in North Korea since Tuesday.
The growing row over Pyongyang's refusal to allow inspections of two of  its nuclear complexes, suspected by Washington of shielding a secret weapons  programme, has heightened tension on the Korean peninsula.
"Pyongyong still says it cannot now interrupt the process at the reactor  but that the surveillance machinery put in place by the IAEA guarantees that  there will not be any diversion of nuclear material to military ends," IAEA  spokesman Hans Friedrich Meyer said earlier.
The IAEA said late Thursday that North Korea had begun extracting fuel  rods from its five-megawatt Yongbyon reactor, 90 kilometres (55 miles) north  of Pyongyang, in a "serious violation" of IAEA inspection terms and that it  would inform the UN Security Council.
On Friday the agency rejected a North Korean proposal to keep fuel rods  from the controversial nuclear reactor in a "safe place under seal" ahead of  resumed talks on the issue.
"That won't work. We will no longer be able to verify with certainty if  any of the nuclear material has been diverted," an agency official said.
However, US Defence Secretary William Perry said Friday said the IAEA had  told the United States that "it is confident that there has been no diversion  of the fuel that has just been discharged."
Meyer confirmed that the uranium rods so far withdrawn showed too high a  radioactivity level to allow diversion to military uses at present.
