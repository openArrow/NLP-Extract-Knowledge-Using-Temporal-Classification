Some 60 people were injured Monday in clashes  between riot police and thousands of anti-nuclear demonstrators opposed to a  planned nuclear waste dump on South Korea's eastern coast, news report said.
Violence erupted in Uljin, 330 kilometers (190 miles) southeast of Seoul,  when thousands of riot police, helped by a helicopter, unleashed a tear gas  attack on 5,000 protesters, said KBS, the state-run broadcasting network.
Clashes lasted several hours and 45 protesters and 15 police officers were  injured and 24 demonstrators arrested, the national Yonhap news agency said.
At one point, hundreds of students and residents brandished iron pipes in  vicious fighting around piles of burning tyres.
Almost all shops in Uljin, a fishing base and the site of one of South  Korea's nine operational nuclear power plants, were closed in a show of  support reflecting widespread sentiment against the nuclear waste reservoir to  be built there, the agency said.
Government plans to build nuclear waste dumps in remote rural areas have  triggered violent protests by residents, despite offers for compensation and  development funds.
In the past three weeks, residents near a nuclear power plant in Kori, 450  kilometers (270 miles) southeast of Seoul, have staged almost daily protests,  denouncing the government's move to build an underground nuclear waste dump  near their village.
Protesters in Uljin also urged the government to scrap plans to build new  nuclear power plants near their town, voicing concern about possible  radioactive leakage.
