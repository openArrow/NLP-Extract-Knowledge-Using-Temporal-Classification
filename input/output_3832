Thai police scoured the border with Cambodia   Wednesday in search of two foreigners, one a UN worker, who went missing on a  sightseeing trip to a temple under the control of the Khmer Rouge.
The Belgian embassy in Bangkok identified the missing man as Michel Baran  and said the woman who disappeared with him was also believed to be Belgian,  although her name was not known.
Baran works for the Bangkok-based UN Economic and Social Commission for  Asia and the Pacific, or ESCAP, an embassy official said.
The couple's car was found near the Preah Vihear temple, opposite  Thailand's Sisaket province, 570 kilometers (350 miles) east of Bangkok.
The 1,000-year-old temple is set on a dramatic escarpment overlooking  dense jungle on Cambodia's Dangrek mountain range, but tourists enter from the  Thai side of the border as access from Cambodia requires a hazardous climb up  a steep cliff face.
Khmer Rouge guerrillas seized the historic temple last July and the  radical faction still controls the area.
Thai military officials said recently that the access to temple from  Thailand was closed.
"We are appealing to all the authorities that can help in both countries,"  the Belgian official told AFP.
Border police reached by telephone from Bangkok said Wednesday they were  still searching for the couple.
A Suranari official said on Tuesday that police were looking through every  village along the border and asking every village headman if they had seen the  missing couple.
Thai border units in recent weeks have reported an increase in  cross-border banditry involving both Khmer Rouge and Cambodian government  troops.
Khmer Rouge guerrillas freed an American aid worker unharmed on May 11,  along with her two Cambodian colleagues, after holding them for nearly six  weeks in southern Cambodia.
But two Britons and an Australian are still missing after being abducted  April 11, reputedly by the ultra-left guerrillas.
