Their only out-and-out attacker is William Ramallo, 30, nicknamed "the  phantom", who scored seven times in the qualifiers including the goal in a 1-1  draw against Ecuador that clinched the finals berth.
Leftback Luis Cristaldo, 24, may also catch the eye. Like Andreas Brehme  for Germany, he is a continual attacking threat and has a formidable  long-range shot.
Apart from a 6-0 loss to Brazil in the return qualifier, Azkargorta's  defenders have proven reliable. Marco Sandy, Gustavo Quinteros, and Miguel  Rimba form the nucleus of their rearguard.
For a country of less than eight million people with just 15,000  registered players qualification is a major achievement in itself. But in a  group that also includes Spain and South Korea they must have a good chance of  making the second round.
Bolivia played in the 1930 and 1950 finals but this is the first time they  have played their way to the finals. They were invited on the first occasion  and qualified without playing in 1950 when two teams in their group dropped  out.
In their previous appearances they lost all their three games, scored no  goals and conceded 16. The country's solitary international success was when  they won the 1963 South American championships.
