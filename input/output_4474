Indonesian police have found evidence for the  first time that the tentacles of Hong Kong-based organized crime have taken  hold in Jakarta, the Antara news agency said Friday.
"We found evidence of the activity of the Chinese criminal syndicate here  when we investigated the killing of businessman Nyo Beng Seng in downtown  Jakarta not long ago," Major General Hindarto, head of the Jakarta police, was  quoted by Antara as saying.
Triad, or crime syndicate, activity in Asia was previously thought to be  confined to Hong Kong, China, Singapore and Taiwan, where members are engaged  in such illegal businesses as drugs, prostitution, blackmail and gambling.
Hindarto said Indonesian police discovered that a triad was operating in  the country when they uncovered triad involvement in the narcotics trade in  Bali, and in extortion, gambling and the "selling" of women from Singkawang,  West Kalimantan, for the "entertainment business" in Hong Kong.
He said the police are now probing the murder of Nyo Beng Seng by trying  to identify other persons targeted by the gangsters syndicate. He did not give  further details.
Nyo, the director of Irama Tara recording company, was apparently slain by  a gang of hired killers near his home in downtown Jakarta in early March.
