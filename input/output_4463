China had no immediate reaction Friday to US  President Bill Clinton's decision to renew its most favored nation trade  status and abandon his policy of linking trade to human rights.
A foreign ministry spokesman said he hoped that a reaction to the  overnight  announcement would be forthcoming later Friday morning.
Xinhua news agency and Chinese radio reported the decision in brief  dispatches from Washington, emphasising Clinton's only sanction of banning  imports of Chinese guns and ammunition from China.
The reports also noted that he had decided to retain sanctions imposed  after the Tiananmen massacre in 1989.
These include "denial of participation in the U.S. trade and development  assistance program, U.S. opposition to non-basic human-needs loans to China by  the World Bank and suspension of weapons deliveries," Xinhua said.
The reports made no further comment on Clinton's decision.
The move has been interpreted overseas as a victory for China, which --  apart from several gestures to Washington -- has maintained a tough stance  towards Clinton's 1993 decision to link this year's renewal to "overall  significant progress" in human rights.
Chinese newspapers Friday made no reference to the announcement, which  came at about 5:00 a.m. local time (2100 GMT Thursday).
