World number one Miguel Indurain was given  an early shock in the Tour of Italy here on Sunday when Frenchman Armand de  las Cuevas won the opening day time trial in record time.
De las Cuevas, 25, took the pink jersey by winning the 7km solo ride in an  average time of 53.39km/h.
That forced Liege-Bastogne-Liege classic winner Evgeni Berzin of Russia  into second by two seconds while race favourite Indurain lost five in third  place.
De las Cuevas' time was the first time any rider had averaged over 53km/h  in a Giro time trial.
He said: "Beating Indurain over seven kilometres is good. Beating him over  40 would be even better."
Indurain, going for a hat-trick of Giro wins to match his Tour de France  successes, has based his major tour victories on time trial wins and was  expected to win here.
But he still gained time on his major rivals. Italians Gianni Bugno and  Claudio Chiappucci conceded 14secs and 28secs respectively.
The morning stage was won by Endrio Leoni, who outsprinted fellow Italians  Giovanni Lombardi and Adriano Baffi to take the 86km run.
