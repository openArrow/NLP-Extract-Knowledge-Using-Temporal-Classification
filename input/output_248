A tear-gas cannister was let off outside the  offices of the Japanese Embassy here on Friday, a day after Tokyo officials  decided to ban Argentine football hero Diego Maradona.
No members of the embassy staff were hurt in the attack, but two  Argentinians needed attention after inhaling the gas.
The embassy offices are located on the ninth floor of the Rio de la Plata  office building.
Leaflets criticising the Japanese decision, written by the self-proclaimed  People's Revolutionary Organisation, were found in the surrounding streets.
The Japanese justice ministry refused Maradona a visa because it said he  had been implicated in drug cases more than once.
Maradona was arrested in Buenos Aires in 1991 for cocaine possession, and  five months later was given a 14-month suspended sentence by an Italian court  for using cocaine.
He was also suspended from international competition for 15 months in 1991  and 1992 after testing postive for cocaine use.
The justice ministry's immigration bureau, however, granted a visa to  Claudio Caniggia, who recently ended a 13-month soccer ban for his alleged use  of cocaine. Caniggia would have been allowed to go to Japan because he had not  faced criminal charges.
Argentina had planned to play Japan and France later this month in the  Kirin Cup as part of their World Cup buildup.
