Olympique Marseille presented a rescue package to  the French league here Tuesday in a bid to ward off any further sanctions.
The club's financial director Alain Laroche told the league's financial  watchdog, the DNCG, a Canadian mining firm was ready to put 70 million francs  (10 million dollars) on the table and a further 200 million francs (30 million  dollars) next season.
Laroche would not name the backers and dismissed claims the club was on  the verge of being wound up.
A Marseille commercial court last week ordered an investigation of the  club's accounts after an audit revealed debts of 404 million francs although  the club claimed the net deficit after trading losses was only 67 million  francs.
Marseille have been demoted to the second division for their alleged part  in a match-fixing scandal which clinched their fifth successive league title  last year, just five days before they became the first French club to win the  European Cup.
Bernard Tapie, the club's embattled president who has appealed against his  life ban from football, was not at the hearing. He faces claims for at least  500 million francs from different creditors and is fighting off the bailiffs.
