Boris Becker moved into only the fourth clay-court  final of a career dominated by grass and hardcourts Saturday as he ousted Ivan  Ivanisevic 6-2, 7-6 (7/5) at the Italian Open.
The triple Wimbledon winner gained a dose of confidence on clay in time  for the start of the French Open in just over a week with his one hour,  37-minute victory.
Becker will play American Pete Sampras in Sunday's final. Sampras beat  Czech Slava Dosedel, world-ranked 51, 6-1, 6-2, in the other semi-final.
The eighth-seeded German world number 13 took the opening set 6-2 from the  Croatian and grabbed a 4-1 lead in the second set before Ivansevic woke up.
"That is too much to give to a good player like Boris", said Ivanisevic,  last year's losing finalist to Jim Courier at the Foro Italico, but a two-time  loser this spring in first-round contests on clay.
Becker was broken for 3-4 by the 22-year-old Croatian and the second set  eventually went to a tiebreaker.
Becker, playing in Rome for the first time in six years, came back from  2-4  down and swept into the final on his first match point when he  anticipated an Ivansevic volley return at the net and put the ball out of the  frustrated Croatian's reach.
"I had a lot of easy mistakes", said Ivansevic, who hurt his knee this  week playing soccer in Rome and has been under treatment."I'm disappointed, I  don't know exactely what went wrong.
"I couldn't seem to put a ball in the court. But I still think that I am  playing good tennis no matter."
