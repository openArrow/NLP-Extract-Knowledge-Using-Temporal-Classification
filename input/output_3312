US and Japanese negotiators met here Monday for  the seventh time in five days to try and break a three-month deadlock in  bilateral trade negotiatons.
Asked on his way into the meeting if he expected an agreement by the end  of the day, Japanese Deputy Foreigner Minister for Economic Affairs Sakayuki  Hayashi would only say "that we are still working on it."
US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor left the building shortly before the  Japanese delegation arrived and said that intensive discussions were  continuing and that negotiators were about to begin a new round of talks.
A senior official from the Japanese finance ministry, Eisuke Sakakibara,  took part in the talks for the first time and had apparently just arrived from  Tokyo.
The two sides are trying to set ground rules for a resumption of  negotiations on ways to open Japan's markets and reduce its 60 billion dollar  trade surplus with the United States.
Bilateral talks broke down in February in disagreement over how to measure  progress.
The latest effort to reach an agreement began Thursday and was originally  scheduled to last only one day. US Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said Monday  that the fact that talks were continuing was a good sign.
