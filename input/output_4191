A group of Taiwanese animal breeders Thursday  demonstrated in front of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), protesting US  trade sanctions aimed at influencing Taiwan's wildlife policy.
Some 100 breeders, one leading a tiger he raised, protested a decision by  Washington to slap sanctions on Taiwanese leather and coral goods in response  to Taipei's tolerance of illegal trade in rhinoceros horns and tiger parts.
"We strongly protest that the United States uses its Pelly Amendment to  impose trade sanction against Taiwan," said Weng Ching-ho, referring to the  law under the US Fisheries Act which stipulates that any country engaging in  activities endangering wildlife will be subject to trade sanctions.
The sanctions are likely to cost Taiwan around 20 million US dollars in  lost exports.
The government here has decided to revise the wildlife conservation law to  mete out stiffer punishments against those deemed to be endangering certain  animal species. Under the revised law, anyone selling, breeding and killing  endangered species will be subject to jail terms up to seven years.
