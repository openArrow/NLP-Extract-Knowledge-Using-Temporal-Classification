A famine has begun to appear in southern Sudan,  where children aged six months to five years are showing signs of  malnutrition, the relief agency Medecins Sans Frontiers (Doctors Without  Borders) reported Friday.
It said 45.4 percent of young children in the region were generally  malnourished, while in the Alek region 10.3 percent were suffering from severe  malnutrition.
A study the agency corroborated findings by other international  organizations, prompting Medecins Sans Frontieres to appeal for urgent  measures to be taken in southern Sudan.
