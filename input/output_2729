Rain finally washed out New Zealand's second  one-day international against England at Lord's on Saturday.
Umpires David Shepherd and Alan Whitehead abandoned all hope of play after  a post-lunch pitch inspection.
By then pools of water had formed on the outfield and most spectators were  already heading home.
The match was sold out well in advance, and the 28,000 fans will be  praying that the weather improves sufficiently to allow play tomorrow.
However, given the state of the ground and a gloomy forecast for the rest  of the weekend, it looks likely the match will be abandoned altogether.
That would give England the one-day trophy, thanks to their 42-run victory  in the first of the two scheduled one-day internationals, at Birmingham on  Thursday.
