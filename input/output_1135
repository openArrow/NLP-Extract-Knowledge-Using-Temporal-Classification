President Fidel Ramos on Tuesday ordered the  justice department to release a captured senior official of the insurgent  Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), in a move aimed at reviving peace  talks after the rebels threatened to pull out.
A palace statement said Ramos had ordered the department to file the  appropriate motions with a local court for the release of Wilma Tiamzon "on  the recognizance of any responsible institution," as a gesture towards "peace  and national reconciliation."
Tiamzon, believed to be a member of the executive committee of the CPP,  was captured with four other communist leaders earlier this month.
However, Tiamzon said she was seriously ill and in need of medical  treatment even as the CPP leadership threatened to call off possible peace  talks with the government unless she was released.
Ramos had previously insisted that charges had already been filed against  Tiamzon and it was up to the courts to decide whether she should be freed.  However, he later allowed her to be transferred to a government hospital.
