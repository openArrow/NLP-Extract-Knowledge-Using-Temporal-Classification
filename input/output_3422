Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai says his  government will investigate US charges of drug trafficking against a former  member of parliament, a news report said Tuesday.
"The government promises that this matter will not just fade away," Chuan  told the Bangkok Post.
A California court indicted Thanong Siripreechapong in 1991 on charges of  smuggling some 45 tons of marijuana into the United States over several years.
Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Viravan said Thailand's Office of the  Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) had asked US authorities to provide the  evidence against Thanong, the English-language daily said.
Thanong resigned last Saturday as a member of the House of Representatives  with the biggest opposition party, Chart Thai, representing northeastern  Nakhom Phanom province. His successor will be chosen August 7 in a special  by-election.
US authorities also have refused a visa to a second Thai MP, Mongkol  Chongsutthanamanee, saying they have sufficient reason to believe he has been  involved in drug trafficking.
Chuan told the Post he had met with Mongkol and Mongkol wants the  government to investigate the matter.
Meanwhile, Amnuay said Thailand's marijuana production has fallen sharply  over the past decade, from 2,500 tons annually to just a few hundred tons, and  that efforts to totally eliminate marijuana growing would continue.
