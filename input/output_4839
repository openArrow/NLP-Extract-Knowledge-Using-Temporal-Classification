Nancy Ramsbottom, still looking for her  first win in 10 years on the women's golf tour, carded a second-round 71 here  Friday to stretch her lead in the Corning Classic to two shots.
Ramsbottom's effort, seven shots higher than her opening 64, included a  three-putt from three feet for a double bogey at the sixth.
She rebounded with birdies at 12, 16 and 18, the last a curling, downhill  30-footer that gave her a 36-hole total of 135.
"I just said, 'You've got a lot of golf left, just relax. You've been  putting well and just forget about it,'" she said. "I just got my momentum  going back and I got my confidence back."
It also helped that gusty winds pushed up scores generally.
Martha Nause's 69 was the best of the day and left her in second place on  137.
Pat Bradley, who started the day one shot back, carded a 73 to lie tied  with Beth Daniel (71) on 138.
"It was tough to club," Ramsbottom said. "I wasn't hitting it close that  often today. I had a lot of 30- and 35- footers today."
Amy Benz, who began the day tied with Bradley for second place, rocketed  to a 78.
Nause said the key to her low round was good guessing.
"There were many times when you're standing there waiting to hit and the  wind literally would be coming from every different direction," she said. "And  it made a big difference, too, because it was strong wind and it was probably  a two-club difference the times it was coming at you."
