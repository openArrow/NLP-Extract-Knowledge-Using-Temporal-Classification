Palestinian police fired on an Israeli car which   drove through a joint checkpoint in the Gaza Strip without stopping on  Monday, military sources said.
Shmuel Cohen, who was carrying Palestinian workers in his car, told state  radio he had not stopped because he only wanted to be checked by the troops  manning the Israeli side of the crossing.
He was taking the workers to his garage in the Erez industrial zone which  is in the Gaza Strip but in an area still under Israeli control.
The Israelis had told him to turn back and as he did so the Palestinian  guards opened fire, blowing out a tyre but causing no injuries, the sources  said.
Under the autonomy agreement, Israeli civilians must present their  identification papers to the Palestinian force.
There was no immediate Palestinian version of the incident.
