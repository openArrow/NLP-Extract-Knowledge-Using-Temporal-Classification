Chancellor Helmut Kohl Tuesday said the fight against  unemployment in Germany went by way of Europe.
"Unemployment, the level of which cannot be justified, must be countered  first by measures taken at the national and European level," he told a meeting  of the federation of German Industry.
There are currently some 3.8 million unemployed in Germany, representing  8.4 percent of the working population.
These measures, he said, should include a greater flexibility of the  labour market, reductions in wage costs and specific measures to help the  young and the long-term unemployed.
Europe had an important contribution to make to employment, growth and  stability within Germany, he also said, adding that millions of jobs were  linked to German exports to the European Union.
The extention of part-time work could also help bring down the level of  unemployment in the country, he added.
Kohl was speaking on his return from talks with the French government in  Mulhouse, eastern France, at which a group of experts put forward a series of  proposals to counter unemployment.
Their report notably recommended reducing labour costs, notably for those  with few qualifications, in line with the situation in the United States.
It also spoke out against the "excessive level of job security" granted to  people in work, notably in public services.
New jobs could be created in the service industries over the next few  years, according to the experts who also suggested that more "flexi-time work"  would offer better inducements to boost employment than bringing down the  retirement age.
