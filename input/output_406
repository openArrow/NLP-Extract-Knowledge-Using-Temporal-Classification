Japan's main opposition Liberal Democratic Party  plans to submit a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata,  possibly as soon as budget bills are approved, according to party leader Yohei  Kono.
In an interview with the Asahi Shimbun published Saturday, he said that  the Hata coalition, which holds only 190 seats in the 511-seat lower house,  was formed against "the people's will."
The ruling coalition was forced to form a minority government last month  after the Social Democratic Party (SDP) withdrew its support. It is Japan's  first minority government in 39 years.
Kono hinted that the no-confidence motion might be submitted after budget  bills are passed. He said: "I think it is necessary to pass the budget bills  for the sake of people's daily life."
The bills, for the fiscal year to March 1995, are expected to be approved  during the current parliamentary session which ends June 29.
Kono, whose party is the biggest in parliament, urged the SDP to back the  no-confidence motion. He said he wanted to link up with the SDP to overthrow  the Hata coalition if the two parties could agree common policies.
The two parties, which control 280 seats in the lower house, have already  agreed to cooperate in parliament.
Hata has said he does not intend to call a snap general election if a  no-confidence motion is passed.
