Six relatives of the confessed  killer of a Mexican presidential candidate who fled here claiming harassment  will be allowed to stay pending an asylum hearing, their lawyer said.
Peter Schey said Tuesday that Mario Aburto's mother, brother, two sisters,  a nephew and a sister-in-law would stay with Aburto's father and brother, both  legal US residents, in San Pedro, California.
The group jumped a border fence Sunday and were released from custody late  Monday.
Aburto confessed to the shooting death of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling  Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) candidate, after a campaign rally in  Tijuana on March 23.
Aburto has been charged with second-degree murder and is being held, along  with three other suspects, at a maximum-security prison near Mexico City.
Schey said immigration authorities were considering whether to grant  political asylum to Aburto's relatives, a decision which could take anywhere  from six months to a year.
The six told the lawyer that since Colosio's assassination there had been  several attempted break-ins at their home in Tijuana, and that one of their  cars was riddled with bullets when it was parked.
Schey said that Aburto's father, who will be elegible for US citizenship  in a few months, could also petition for legal residence for his relatives.
