Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's party  strengthened its hold on power in the North West Frontier Province Thursday by  winning the seat of deputy speaker in the provincial assembly.
Pakistan People's Party (PPP) nominee Allaud Din was elected to the post  with 44 votes against 33 polled by opposition candidate Ghulam Nabi Khan in  the 83-member house, assembly official said.
Political sources said the PPP's prospects in the election improved after  it won back an important group led by former chief minister Mir Afzal Khan,  who had rebelled earlier this month.
