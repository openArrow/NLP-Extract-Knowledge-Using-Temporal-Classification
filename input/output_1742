England will send a full team to August's  Commonwealth games in Victoria, Canada after averting a financial crisis.
The English feared they would have to leave nearly a quarter of their  280-strong team behind because of a 90,000 pounds shortfall in funds.
But chairman Norman Sarsfield told a meeting of the Commonwealth Games  Council for England in London on Thursday that fund-raising was back on target.
Sarsfield said: "We shall certainly be sending a full team competing in  ten sports to the Games."
