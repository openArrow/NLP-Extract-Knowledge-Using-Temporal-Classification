Pete Sampras moved into the semi-finals of the  Italian Open on Friday with the spectre of the French Open dogging his every  move just 10 days before the start of the grand slam event.
The 22-year-old world number one defeated home star Andrea Gaudenzi 6-3,  7-5, in just under two hours on centre court at the Foro Italico.
The opening game of the second set went to seven break points before  Gaudenzi, the world number 45, finally held. "I had many opportunities," said  Sampras, who admits his toughest test so far this charmed year will come on  the clay at Roland Garros.
In his first week of 1994 on clay, Sampras has dispatched four European  specialists in a fine effort from a man who would always rather be playing on  a hardcourt.
"My tennis has gotten better and better as the week has gone on, I was  pretty happy with the way that I played," he said.
The centre court crowd were staunchly on the side of Gaudenzi, whistling  down some of Sampras' better efforts against their man.
"I've learned to take my time when playing a guy in this country. I knew  Gaudenzi would be playing with a lot of emotion. It was good to win the first  set -- that took the crowd out of the match," Sampras said.
While Sampras had to fight for victory, eighth seed Boris Becker eased  into the semi-finals through the back door as second-seeded German opponent  Michael Stich withdrew prior to their quarter-final match with back pain.
Becker will face Croatia's Goran Ivanisevic in the semi-finals. The fourth  seed defeated Holland's Jacco Eltingh 7-6 (7/5), 6-3.
