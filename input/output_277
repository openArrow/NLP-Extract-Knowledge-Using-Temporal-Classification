European, Russian and US foreign ministers meeting  in Geneva to try to agree upon rekindled peace efforts for Bosnia-Hercegovina  extended their talks Friday beyond the originally expected duration.
A press conference after the talks which had been set for 5:00 p.m. was  now expected round 7:00 p.m. (1700 GMT), a US source said. The meeting is  taking place at the American embassy.
Diplomats earlier said a joint statement could be issued calling for a  ceasefire and stating the desired principles of a political settlement.
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher is attending the meeting, as is  Russian foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev and their Belgian, British, French,  German and Greek counterparts, as well as a representative of the European  Union.
