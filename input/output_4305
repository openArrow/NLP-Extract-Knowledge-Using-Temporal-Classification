Standard and Poors said Thursday it had lifted  surveillance on Walt Disney Company's senior debt and kept its ratings  unchanged.
S and P affirmed its "A-1+" commercial paper and "AA-" rating on Disney's  1.2-billion-dollar senior debt as it removed the ratings from CreditWatch,  where they were placed last February 17.
S and P had put the debt under surveillance because of concerns regarding  the potential debt burden of Disney, which holds 49 percent of Euro Disney.
Euro Disney's debt totals 3.5 billion dollars.
The recent renegotiation of Euro Disney's debt and a refinancing plan,  which includes a Disney investment of 490 million dollars, should  substantially reduce the debt of Euro Disney and allow the theme park to turn  a profit, S and P said in a statement.
Excluding Euro Disney, Disney has had good results with the rest of its  businesses and diversification within the group has protected earnings, S and  P said.
The company posted 17 percent higher operating cash flow in the six months  ended March 31.
In the longer view, S and P said it expects that certain new investments  may produce lower returns than Disney's core businesses.
Additional risks cited were expansion of its film production business and  a controversial plan to build a US history theme park in Virginia.
