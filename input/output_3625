A United Nations special coordinator charged with  the reconstruction of war-torn Sarajevo put the prospective repair bill at 532  million dollars Tuesday.
William Eagleton believes the money should cover a two-phase programme to  rebuild the drinking water and public transport networks, restore electricity  and gas supplies and rebuild hospitals and schools.
The first phase will cover a six-month period, and foresees using around  half the total fund to deal with schemes classified as urgent. Restoring  drinking water to the Bosnian capital alone is set to cost 57 million dollars.  In the transport sector, some 23 million have been earmarked for repairing  Sarajevo airport.
Phase two is scheduled to last for up to two years.
Eagleton unveiled the scheme at the opening of a Vienna conference called  by UN special envoy to ex-Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi. The basis of the  rebuilding plan was agreed by the UN Security Council in March in line with an  accord stipulating the withdrawal of Serbian heavy arms from the city's  environs.
Akashi reminded conferees from 31 countries the UN Protection Force had  already created an interim coordination body in early March to address the  question of Sarajevo's reconstruction.
He explained Eagleton's plan had been worked out following close  cooperation on the ground with Bosnian authorities.
The head of the Bosnian delegation in Vienna, Hasan Muratovic, reminded  those present of the extent of the war damage in Bosnia-Hercegovina as a  whole, but especially in Sarajevo. He stressed the importance of  reestablishing transport links between Sarajevo and the Adriatic coast, part  of which Serb forces continue to block.
Muratovic appealed to the UN Security Council to give unconditional  guarantees of free passage between the capital and the coast.
A second conference, in New York, is due to monitor the scheme' progress  later this year.
