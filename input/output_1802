Canadian authorities seized some 26.5 tonnes of  hashish in a cargo ship in the port of Montreal, officials said Wednesday,  calling it one of the largest drug seizures in North America.
Revenue Minister David Anderson said the drugs, estimated to be worth some  300 million dollars (220 million US), were hidden in a cargo ship that arrived  from Durban, South Africa.
A customs official who noticed something amiss in the papers filed by the  shippers ordered an inspection, which discovered the hashish in containers  from Uganda and Mozambique that also held tea and spices, Anderson said.
No arrests were announced.
