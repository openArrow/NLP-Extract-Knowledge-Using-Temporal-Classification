The chairman of Tibet's parliament-in-exile, Samdhong  Rinpoche, said Monday that as a result of China's settlement policy, Chinese  now outnumbered Tibetans in the country.
In a statement at the end of a visit to Germany, Rinpoche described the  situation in Tibet as "extremely serious."
"In the last three years the Chinese politics of foreign infiltration has  been enforced, there are now 7.5 million Chinese and six million Tibetans  living in Tibet. The Tibetans now are a minority in their own country."
Rinpoche said that Tibetan culture based on the principle of non-violence  was being systematically destroyed and that repression, compulsory meaures and  human rights violations had "become a way of life."
Observing that Germany was playing an increasingly important international  role, he said the Tibetan question belonged on the agenda of a visit Chinese  premier Li Peng was expected to make to Germany in early July.
"This would be the right opportunity for Germany to influence Chinese  politics," Rinpoche said.
Tibetan parliamentarians demanded the restoration of a free and  independent Tibet based on the principles of democracy and justice, he said.  "The right to national self-determination should also apply to Tibet."
