Four years after being filmed smoking crack  cocaine in a police sting and leaving the mayor's office in shame, Marion  Barry has launched a bid to recapture the US capital city's top job.
Drawing a comparison between himself and Nelson Mandela, the new president  of South Africa, Barry kicked off his campaign Saturday before a group of  almost 300 supporters. His slogan: "Mandela in April, Marion in September."
Barry, a former chemistry teacher and civil rights activist who held the  mayor's office for 12 years, left office in 1990 after being arrested for  possession of cocaine.
After serving a six-month jail term, voters from one of Washington's  poorest districts elected him in 1992 to a seat on the city council.
The 58-year-old who remarried this year for the fourth time, said he has  learned lessons from his past errors.
One of his rivals in the mayoral race, City Councilor John Ray, said the  voters will not be fooled by such statements. Ray characterized Barry's  campaign as "a hustle on this city."
