The Channel tunnel will begin commercial operations  this week with a first paying trip by a freight shuttle, Anglo-French  operators Eurotunnel announced on Monday.
The trip will be by Thursday.
A Eurotunnel board meeting held Sunday took the decision following issue  of an operating certificate by an Anglo-French commission on Saturday for  freight trains operated by British Rail and the French railway company SNCF  and for the shuttle, transporting goods vehicles.
Eurotunnel chairman Andre Benard said Monday the certificate meant that  "Eurotunnel has solved all technical and security problems" for the tunnel's  operation.
Eurotunnel also said it would be paying its first dividends based on  results in the year 2003. It expects revenue of 5.139 billion francs (901  million dollars) in 1995, rising to 7.19 billion francs (1.26 billion dollars)  in 1996.
Independent consultants SETECE-WSA expect revenue of 12.92 billion francs  in 2003, rising to 22.32 billion francs in 2013.
Eurotunnel said it would have 22 percent of crosschannel passenger traffic  in 1995, or some 16.31 million travelers, rising to 28 percent in 1996.
For goods, Eurotunnel expects 11.4 percent, or 11.4 million tons, in 1995,  rising to 15.6 percent in 1996 (16.01 million tons).
