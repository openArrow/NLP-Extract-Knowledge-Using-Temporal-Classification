Williams-Renault's official test driver, David  Coulthard, is to join Damon Hill in the team's four-day test at the Jerez  track in Spain, it was announed here on Friday.
The announcement strengthened speculation Coulthard could take Ayrton  Senna's place in the Williams team, at least for the immediate future.
Senna, the Brazilian three-times Formula One world champion, died at the  San Marino Grand Prix on May 1, and the team ran only Hill at last week's  Monaco race.
Williams said they would not formally name their second driver until May  26, the eve of the second practice for the May 29 Spanish Grand Prix at  Barcelona.
Coulthard, a Scot, who will be 23 on March 27, has been a test driver for  Williams since July last year.
Hill had the same role until he became team mate to Alain Prost last year.
Coulthard is currently competing in the European Formula 3000  championship, in which he was third last year.
He has pulled out of the race at Pau, France next Monday to do the  Williams test.
