Heavy fighting in Kigali, Rwanda's embattled  capital, prevented a UN plane carrying relief supplies from landing on Sunday,  a UN spokesman said.
But the plane, which was forced to return to Nairobi, went back to Kigali  during a lull in the fighting on Sunday afternoon and and delivered food and  medicines for displaced people and UN soldiers in the city, the spokesman,  Abdul Kabia, told AFP by phone from Kigali.
Normally the United Nations flies to Kigali twice daily but made only one  flight on Sunday because of intensified fighting between Tutsi-led Rwanda  Patriotic Front (RPF) rebels and Hutu-dominated government forces.
Sporadic fighting continued to rage in Kigali, Ruhengeri in the northwest,  and Nkumba further to the north throughout Sunday afternoon, Kabia said.
Clashes were also reported at Bugesera, south of Kigali.
Mortar shells fell in the centre of the capital during heavy fighting on  Sunday morning.
Meanwhile the number of Tutsi civilians who have been holed up for weeks  in the Mille Collines hotel in Kigali has risen from 300 to 540, Kabia added.
Some 240 more people from central Kigali and the suburbs have sought  refuge in the hotel as fighting raged in and around the city over the past  couple of days, he said.
Rwanda plunged back into savage ethnic bloodletting on April 7, a day  after Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana and his Burundian counterpart Cyprien  Ntaryamira were killed in what the Rwandan government said was a rocket attack  on their plane.
Since then an estimated 200,000 Rwandans have been killed and around  500,000 others have fled to neighbouring countries.
