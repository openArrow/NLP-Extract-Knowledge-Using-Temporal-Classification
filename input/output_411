Australia is considering a UN request for a  contingent of troops as part of a 5,500 strong force that may be sent to  Rwanda, officials said here Saturday.
The request followed UN Security Council discussion of a US plan to send  troops to establish protected sites for refugees, although the council on  Friday postponed action on the proposal until next week.
A decision on the request would probably require the approval of cabinet  or at least the prime minister and senior ministers covering defence and  foreign affairs.
Sources here say at least 10 western countries, mostly European, have also  been asked to make a contribution along with a number of African countries if  the Security Council gives the go-ahead.
A foreign affairs department spokesman said: "I can confirm that a request  has been received from the UN in the last few hours, but no decision has been  made about it yet.
The spokesman was unable to say how many troops would be contributed.
