The next round of Bosnia peace talks between the  republic's warring parties and the four-way international contact group will  take place June 6 and 7 in Talloires, southeast France, a diplomatic source  said Thursday.
Two days of talks on a ceasefire and a territorial division of Bosnia  wound up in Talloires Thursday. The source close to the talks said they had  made some progress.
"It was neither a failure nor a success, but we did not expect significant  progress," the same source said.
In Talloires, a diplomat close to the talks said Thursday that the  European, UN, US and Russian negotiators were ready to try to impose a  territorial solution on the warring parties, presumably by threatening to  withdraw peacekeeping forces from Bosnia if the new territorial plan was  rejected.
But a Croat press source earlier the Moslems and Bosnian Croats were ready  to negotiate on the basis of the European Union territorial division plan,  earmarking 51 percent of the republic for the new Moslem-Croat federation and  49 percent for the Bosnian Serb side.
