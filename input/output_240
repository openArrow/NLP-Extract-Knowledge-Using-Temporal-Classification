Malaysia's national car-maker and Japan's  Mitsubishi group have obtained approval to set up a joint company with a  Vietnamese firm to assemble and sell automobiles in Vietnam, officials said  Friday.
Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional Bhd (Proton) and its partners, Mitsubishi  Corporation and Mitsubishi Motor Corporation, are to join forces with  Vietranscimex to establish the Vina Star Motor Corporation, Proton said in a  statement.
The four parties are each to hold 25 percent stakes in Vina Star, which is  to assemble the Delica minibus before it begins assembly of Proton cars later,  Proton said.
Vina Star, which involves a total investment of 50 million US dollars, is  expected to start operations by March next year in Ho Chi Minh City, Proton  said.
It will initially produce 1,000 units of the Delica, and a year later will  raise output to reach 12,000 units a year, it said.
"The investment licence was approved by the Vietnamese State Committee for  Cooperation and Investment in April. Registration procedures are expected to  be completed by this month," a spokesman for Proton said.
Vina Star is to be capitalised at 12 million US dollars, which will later  be raised to 16 million dollars.
Proton, listed on the local bourse, would source its contribution of four  million US dollars for the venture through its internally generated cash  resources, the company said.
Mitsubishi Motor Corp and Mitsubishi Corp hold 17 percent equity in  Malaysia's nine-year-old national car venture, a brainchild of Prime Minister  Mahathir Mohamad.
