At least one person was killed and three injured  in Bosnian Serb attacks on towns in central Bosnia Sunday, Radio Sarajevo  reported.
UN Protection Force spokesman Major Rob Annink confirmed the attacks,  saying 10 Serb shells hit the town of Bugojno and a few shells on Travnik, a  short way to the north, but gave no details of casualties.
The radio report said the attack on Bugojno continued until late  afternoon, killing one person and injuring three. It added that about 100 Serb  shells hit the villages of Turbe and Komar, to the west of Travnik.
Radio Sarajevo also reported intense bombardments around the town of Olovo  in eastern Bosnia, killing one person. Neither the attack nor the killing  could be independently confirmed.
The Moslem-led Bosnian army has been pressing in recent weeks to make  progress near Turbe, in particular aiming to move towards Donji Vakuf and the  Vlasic plateau, from where Sunday's shells were fired.
Separately, Bosnian army commander General Ratko Mladic called on UNPROFOR  commander General Sir Michael Rose to ensure that Serbs abide by a NATO threat  to withdraw from around the eastern enclave of Gorazde.
The radio quoted Mladic as telling Rose at a meeting Sunday that: "The  Bosnian side can no longer accept half-solutions which restrict the Bosnian  army and not Serb forces."
This was taken as a reference to UNPROFOR's unsolicited attempts to  persuade Bosnian army forces to withdraw from a three-kilometer (two-mile)  exclusion zone around Gorazde.
The UN force is hoping thereby to persuade Bosnian Serb forces to withdraw  from the zone, as called for by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, under  threat of air strikes.
Annink added that Serb forces had allowed UN observers to patrol the  20-kilometer (12-mile) heavy weapons exclusion zone around Gorazde, following  a meeting between a UN and local Serb commander Saturday.
