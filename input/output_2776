An official of the neo-fascist National  Alliance was wounded Saturday when masked assailants attacked the party's  offices here, police said.
The attack came on the sidelines of an anti-fascist demonstration in this  northern town a day after legislators confirmed Prime Minister Silvio  Berlusconi and his government of conservatives, neo-fascists and federalists  in office.
The local National Alliance party chief suffered head wounds when  unidentified attackers stormed his offices and smashed boards and windows. He  was not seriously hurt in the attack.
The demonstration was called a week after a march by 300 neo-Nazis  brandishing Nazi emblems and shouting fascist slogans.
A militant of the federalist Northern League was also roughed up and  slightly wounded by anarchists in Saturday's demonstration.
