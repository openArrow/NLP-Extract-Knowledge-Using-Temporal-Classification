A Colombian drug boss was ordered released by a  judge Friday after serving two years of a 17 year sentence for drug  trafficking and illegal enrichment.
After his arrest April 27, 1992, Ivan Urdinola negotiated a reduction in  sentence to four and half years by confessing voluntarily to the charges and  turning over part of his assets.
But a judge, whose identity is secret, decided to further reduce his  sentence to 24 months, which would make Urdinola eligble for immediate release.
The Attorney General's office, seeking to prevent his leaving the country,  recently asked US authorities for evidence against Urdinola on heroine  trafficking, kidnapping for ransom, illegal enrichment and other charges.
America claims Urdinola is one of the leaders of the Valle cocaine cartel.
The Attorney General's office was holding Urdinola under a special order,  but the Procurator General's office ordered it revoked May 2 for lack of  evidence against him in several murder cases in the province of El Valle, in  western Colombia.
The newspaper El Tiempo on Friday said the judge who reduced Urdinola's  sentenced used a controversial proceedure in effect giving him the maximum  benefits allowed for under two separate laws.
One law modified and supplanted a law already on the books, but the judge  applied only those aspects of both laws that favored Urdinola, a procedure  that some jurists say is illegal.
