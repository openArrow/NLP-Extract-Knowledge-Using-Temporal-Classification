Washington and Seoul have opened a military hotline  for emergencies related to the running row over North Korea's nuclear  ambition, military officials here said Friday.
The hotline was first used Friday by US Secretary of Defense William Perry  and his South Korean counterpart, Lee Byong-Tae, "for talks on maintaining  close military cooperation between the two allies," a defense ministry  spokesman said.
It was the first military hotline between Washington and Seoul since the  1950-1953 Korean conflict in which US troops fought on the South's side.
The conversation between Perry and Lee lasted 15 minutes, focusing on  military preparedness between allied troops in South Korea, the spokesman  said. Perry voiced concern about the lingering nuclear impasse, he added.
Lee suggested establishing the hotline during Perry's trip to Seoul last  month, when tensions escalated over North Korea's continued refusal to accept  outside inspections.
