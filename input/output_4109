Japan's Toshiba Corp. said Thursday its consolidated  pre-tax earnings grew five percent from a year earlier to 90.2 billion yen  (876 million dollars) in the year to March despite flat global sales.
The country's second-biggest electrical machinery maker said sales grew  less than one percent to 4,631 billion yen, depressed by lower sales of  consumer products, information and communication systems, and electronic  devices.
Toshiba offered no forecast for consolidated earnings before tax in the  current year but said net profit, which plunged 41 percent to 12.1 billion yen  in the latest year, was expected to rebound to 25 billion yen. Global sales  are meanwhile projected to climb to 4,750 billion yen.
"Although memory devices and liquid crystal displays, and personal  computers for the US market, recorded healthy sales, domestic sales of  distribution systems and colour picture tubes, and medical systems in overseas  markets, were low," the company said in a statement.
"Overall demand for power plant and equipment, and overseas sales of  transportation equipment, were robust, but sales of industrial electrical  apparatus and mechatronoc equipment declined.
"The cool summer in Japan and slow individual spending deeply cut into  anticipated sales of airconditioners," the company added.
Toshiba said sales of information and communication systems and electronic  devices fell marginally to 2,438 billion yen while sales of heavy electrical  apparatus jumped nine percent to 1,232 billion yen.
But sales of consumer products and other products dropped eight percent to  1,314 billion yen. Overseas sales meanwhile grew two percent from a year  earlier to 1,403 billion yen.
