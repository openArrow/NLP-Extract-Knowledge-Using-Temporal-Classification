The main European currencies were stable early on  Tuesday despite an unexpectedly big increase in the German M3 money supply in  April.
By mid morning the dollar was being quoted at 1.6495 marks from 1.6465 at  the close on Monday.
The aggregate figure for the German M3 money supply rose 15.8 percent in  April. Analysts had forecast an increase of only 13.4 percent.
The figure, which was well above the Bundesbank's 1994 target of 4.0-6.0  percent, had no effect on the market, said Graham Cocks, economist at the  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
"We now know the Bundesbank doesn't look at the German M3 figure," he  said, adding: "There has been a statistical problem with M3 for a year and a  half and the Bundesbank seems to have realised it at last."
Despite an explosion in the M3 figure since the beginning of the year, the  Bundesbank has cut interest rates several times and by more than had been  expected.
Cocks said the market payed more attention to statements from the  Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer, who had said in Helsinki: "We are not  following a step-by-step cut in interest rates for the time being."
Cocks said: "Such statements lead the market to believe the Bundesbank  will continue to reduce its securities repurchasing agreement (repo), but that  there will be no cut in the discount rate within the next three months."
By mid morning the dollar was being traded at 1.6495 marks from 1.6465 at  the close on Monday, at 104.31 yen from 104.27, at 1.4105 Swiss francs from  1.4065 and at 5.6388 French francs from 5.6413.
Sterling was at 1.5052 dollars from 1.5050, at 2.4828 marks from 2.4780,  at 157.01 yen from 156.93, at 2.1231 Swiss francs from 2.1168 and at 8.4874  French francs from 8.4901.
In Paris, the mark was firmer against the French franc on Tietmeyer's  statements. Dealers also said that the election of Roman Herzog from the  conservative Christian Union parties as German president was good for the mark  as it showed the governing Christian Democrats had a chance of success in the  October legislative elections.
By mid morning the mark was at 3.4222 French francs from 3.4205 at the  close on Friday. Most markets in Europe were closed on Monday for the  Penticost holiday.
The US currency firmed to 5.6382 French francs from 5.6200 at the close on  Friday, to 1.6473 marks from 1.6465 and to 104.25 yen from 104.10.
