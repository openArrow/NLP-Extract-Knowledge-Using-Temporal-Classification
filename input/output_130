Police discovered the disembowelled bodies of  four army majors in Kompong Speu province bordering Phnom Penh, a local  newspaper reported Friday.
The bodies of the four, who had been reported missing, were discovered by  police May 6, the Rasmey Kampuchea paper said.
Police said they were continuing their investigation into the brutal  murders.
But a local soldier, who was not named, told the paper that the four might  have been killed because they had failed to come through with jobs they had  promised in exchange for money.
They had also borrowed money and failed to pay it back, the soldier said.
