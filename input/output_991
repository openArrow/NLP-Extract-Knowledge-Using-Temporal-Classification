A draft European Union plan to fight unemployment  through investments and business deregulation ran into strong opposition from  Britain and Germany here on Monday.
European Commission president Jacques Delors urged foreign ministers to  push the plan forward over the heads of finance ministers who were meeting  separately and are balking at finding money for massive capital investments.
Delors also objected to a German proposal that all EU legislation be  reviewed by a panel of independent experts with a view to identifying and  scrapping laws which hinder business activity and the creation of new jobs.
Delors, the EU's chief executive, said he was in "total disagreement" with  the proposal from German Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt because it would  give outsiders power over EU decision-making.
But British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, weighing in with  the Germans, told journalists that Delors was the perfect illustration "of how  a bureaucracy will not reform its own procedures."
Germany and Britain remain in the forefront of countries which insist that  the EU rely largely on the private sector to finance a 120 billion Ecu (135  billion dollar) investment plan launched by EU leaders last December.
They want to build an infrastructure of transportation, energy and  telecommunication networks spanning Europe, in order to support business and  put more people to work.
German Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Ursula Seiler-Albring said  that Bonn would not accept that the EU raise more money to finance these  projects in addition to the lending capacity of the EU's European Investment  Bank.
Clarke agreed. "There are enormous amounts of private capital available  across Europe," he said.
