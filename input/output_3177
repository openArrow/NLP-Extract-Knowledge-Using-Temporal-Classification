A low-flying World War II Lancaster bomber will  drop two million poppies into the English Channel to commemorate allied war  dead during the 50th anniversary celebration of D-Day, it was announced Monday.
The drop will take place in mid-Channel on Sunday June 5 from a Lancaster  swooping low over the liner Canberra carrying hundreds of D-Day veterans back  to the Normandy beaches where they landed 50 years ago, the Defense Ministry  said.
The Canberra will be part of a flotilla of naval and merchant vessels, led  by the Royal Yacht Britannia, that is scheduled to leave Portsmouth, southern  England, on June 5.
The poppies, said a spokesman, would be "biodegradable," and would be  released at an altitude that would not interfere with the engines of other  aircraft in the area.
He said the two million figure had three significances:
"It represents approximately the number of allied troops involved in  Operation Overlord during the first few days.
"We wanted enough poppies to make a good red blob over the channel that  would be seen a long way off.
"And that's about how many that would fit in a Lancaster bomb bay."
