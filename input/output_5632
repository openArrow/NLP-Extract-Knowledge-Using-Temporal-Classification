Mary Pierce, who plays Austria's Petra Ritter for a  place in the women's singles semi-finals at the French Open here today, will  become the first French player to enter the world's 'top-ten' since 1976 when  the new rankings are published next week.
The last French player to do so was Francoise Durr who became the world  number-nine in 1975
The 19-year-old Pierce, who has set a tournament record by conceding only  four games in the first week of the event, is already certain of moving up  from twelfth to at least tenth place.
Her first week performance at the 1994 Championships was better than the  previous best seven-day record set by Martina Navratilova (1985) and Steffi  Graf (1985). Navratilova and Graf both dropped just nine games.
Gabriela Sabatina's decline continues, however. The South American's  first-round defeat has sent her tumbling to either ninth or tenth place in the  forthcoming rankings. It will be Sabatini's lowest-ranking in over seven  years. She was last ranked tenth in April 1987.
