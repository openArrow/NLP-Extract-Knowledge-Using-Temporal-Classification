A population census is to be held in the former  Yugoslav republic of Macedonia from June 21 to July 3, supervised and funded  by the European Union and the Council of Europe.
Parliament voted 57-19 for the measure on Wednesday after 10 days of  intensive debate. Opposition to the census arrangements was headed by  Macedonian nationalists who complained that printing the question papers in  the languages of national minorities as well as Macedonian would open the way  to cantonisation of the country.
A chief aim of the exercise is to establish accurately the numbers of  ethnic minorities, including Albanians, Turks, Gypsies and Serbo-Croats.  According to Macedonian estimates, Albanians amount to 20 percent of the  population of slightly more than two million, but Albanians claim to account  for as much as 40 percent.
The figures remain unclear because in the previous census in 1991 in the  old Yugoslavia many ethnic Albanians refused to take part, citing linguistic  problems.
