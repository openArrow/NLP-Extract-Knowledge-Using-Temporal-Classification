British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said Thursday  that Britain could not maintain a military presence in Bosnia forever, but  declined to say whether London would call for an early pull-out if peace talks  fail to make progress.
"It can't be an everlasting presence. It has justified itself up to now.  We believe it will continue to justify itself, but we certainly have no desire  to keep British troops indefinitely in Bosnia," he said.
He was responding to questions on whether Britain would withdraw its  forces, serving under the United Nations, if peace talks failed to make  progress.
Hurd had earlier held 45 minutes of talks with French Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur on the sidelines of a two-day, 53-delegation conference on  European stability here.
Hurd, who also met Thursday with French counterpart Alain Juppe and  Defence Minister Francois Leotard, said however that no date had been agreed  by France and Britain for the withdrawal of their peacekeeping forces in  Bosnia.
France has warned it would pull out half its forces by the end of the year  if no progress in peace talks is made.
"We have not been so precise about dates, but we are on the same line, in  our main objective which is to bring about a negotiated peace," Hurd said.
Other questions broached with the French involved Russia and the European  Union, he said.
Speaking of the search for a successor to Jacques Delors as president of  the European Commission, Hurd said former British conservative minister and  current EU trade commissioner Sir Leon Brittan was the best candidate.
The question was touched on during talks with Balladur, he said.
