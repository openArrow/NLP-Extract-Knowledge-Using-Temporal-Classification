Britain's Prince Charles signed a  contract here Wednesday for the first-ever publication of the complete  notebooks of the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin and called on Russians to  preserve their cultural heritage.
"In Britain and in Europe, but particularly in Britain, we managed to  destroy a very large part of our heritage," the Prince said. "So please learn  from our lessons and don't make the same mistake."
He also called for additional western financial aid to help preserve Saint  Petersburg's historical sights.
"It is absolutely crucial that we find every means to enable a great city  like this, with its extraordinary heritage, not just in terms of buildings but  also in number of museums, all of which are crying out in so many different  ways for help and assistance, to enable them to continue," he said.
The Prince was accompanied on his historic three-day visit here by experts  from his Business Leaders' Forum, who are advising Saint Petersburg on ways to  develop tourism and preserve its cultural heritage.
The Forum is also financing the 750,000-dollar project to publish 800  copies of Pushkin's notebooks in eight volumes.
