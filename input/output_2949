A 19-year-old youth was arrested Sunday for  attempting to set fire to a home for asylum seekers near the southeastern town  of Passau, police announced.
Seventy-seven people, mostly refugees from Bosnia-Hercegovina and the  Serbian province of Kosovo, were sleeping in the house at the time of the  attack.
Police said a flammable liquid was poured at five different places inside  the house in the village of Hauzenberg but no fire had broken out, possibly  because the youth fled when discovered by residents.
Late Saturday in Berlin, 26 members of the neo-Nazi Free German Workers  Party were arrested after shouting Nazi slogans during a private party. They  were released after identity checks.
