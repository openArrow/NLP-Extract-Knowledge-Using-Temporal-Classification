If Romania are to get it right in the World Cup finals at last, they had  better hurry.
Iordanescu, who replaced Cornel Dinu as manager, says they could face  problems qualifying for future World Cups because the country is being drained  of its best players.
"Everyone knows about the stars playing in Italy and Spain but the real  problem is so many players have gone to neighbouring countries, especially  Hungary, and for next to nothing," he said.
Players have been traded off for buses, television sets, even crates of  beer, he said.
The youth squad which supplied the present crop of World Cup players has  been disbanded.
"Next to nothing is being done to develop young players. It's very  worrying," Iordanescu said.
Other Romanian stars who could shine in the United States are Miodrag  Belodedici, eager to make up for missing the last World Cup, and Gheoghe  Popescu.
Defender Belodedici had defected from Nicolae Ceasescu's Romania to  Yugoslavia and, even though the dictator was later deposed, red tape kept him  out of the World Cup side.
He went some way to making up for it with a European Cup medal with Red  Star Belgrade in 1991 but is now with Valencia in Spain.
Popescu, who has spent four seasons as PSV Eindhoven's defensive linchpin  in Holland, and Ilie Dumitrescu are other stars.
Dumitrescu is the only home-based player but Italian clubs have already  approached Steaua Bucharest about the striker.
