The US trade deficit shrank 18.5 percent to  7.46 billion dollars in March, the Commerce Department said Thursday.
Analysts had forecast the trade deficit would narrow to 8.3 billion  dollars from February's revised imbalance of 9.15 billion dollars.
The March trade deficit in goods and services was higher than January's  gap of 6.64 billion dollars.
Despite the general improvement, the United States' goods deficit with  Japan soared by 25.4 percent to 5.8 billion dollars, the third-highest record  level.
The department said a huge jump in US exports, to a record high, helped  offset record imports.
US exports rose 12.7 percent to a record 42.17 billion dollars, including  an increase of one billion dollars in sales of gold bullion, primarily to  Britain and Switzerland.
Other exports showing large gains were commercial airline sales and  telecommunications equipment.
US imports rose 6.5 percent to 54.21 billion dollars.
