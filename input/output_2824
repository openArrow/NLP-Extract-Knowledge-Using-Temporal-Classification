Guatemala's government and leftist rebels  resumed peace talks in this Mexican city Saturday, working toward a final pact  that would end more than 30 years of civil war.
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio's representative, Hector Rosada, and  leaders of the rebel umbrella group Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity  focused on how to end the plight of up to three million people displaced by  the conflict, sources close to the talks said.
Bishop Rodolfo Quezada Toruno, who mediated previous peace talks between  the two sides, was leading a coalition of social activists taking part in the  dialogue for the first time. The talks are expected to continue through  Tuesday.
"It is not just a matter of ending the armed conflict," Quezada said, "but  also of laying groundwork and reaching political accords on certain specific  issues which definitely were the cause of the conflict."
He said that negotiating work could be accomplished before the rebels are  to disarm, within the next several months.
Representatives of both sides are slated to meet in Oslo, Norway, later  this month and in early June for talks on the politically thorny issue of  setting up a commission that would identify groups and individuals blamed for  massacres and other violence during the conflict.
On March 28, negotiators for the two sides struck a comprehensive  agreement on human rights -- a key rebel demand -- and agreed on a peace talks  timetable.
The timetable calls for establishing terms in September for a final  ceasefire, and then for the signing of a final peace pact in December followed  by the guerrillas' setting down of arms.
Guatemala's conservative army for 34 years has pursued leftist rebel  groups in the country's mountain highlands, often recruiting armed local  residents as insurgency self-defense squads.
