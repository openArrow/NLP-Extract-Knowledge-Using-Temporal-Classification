Security forces have smashed a major international  drug ring in central Iran, arresting 15 traffickers, the official news agency  IRNA reported Tuesday.
Some 190 kilograms (418 pounds) of morphine were also seized in the  operation launched recently in Tehran province, it said.
The agency, quoting intelligence ministry sources, said the ring had been  involved in smuggling of more than one tonne of morphine and two tonnes of  opium to other countries in recent months.
Iran is a transit route for drugs coming from Afghanistan and Pakistan and  headed for European and North American markets.
Authorities here have stepped up the fight against drug trafficking in the  past two years, seizing 15 tonnes of narcotics from March 21 to May 6 this  year.
More than 95 tonnes of drugs were seized last year and 15,000 traffickers  were arrested, according to official figures.
