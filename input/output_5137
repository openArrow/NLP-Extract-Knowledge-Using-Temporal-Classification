The secretary general of the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan  Patriotic Front (RPF) said in an interview appearing here Monday, that the  genocide of the Rwandan Tutsi's is "almost complete."
"If you except the people who managed to escape to neighbouring  countries," the massacres are "almost complete," Theogene Rudasingwa told the  German magazine Der Spiegel.
However, the killings which followed the death of the Hutu president,  Juvenal Habyarimana, in a suspected rocket attack on his plane on April 6,  were not simply ethnic in origin, he said.
"It is a battle between the forces of democracy and dictatorship,"  Rudasingwa said.
"The current war broke out at the moment when the old regime saw itself as  being challenged by a new alliance between Tutsis and Hutus, who were forming  joint opposition parties," Rudasingwa said.
"By good fortune, we are no longer a purely Tutsi organisation. We are the  only force capable of ending the massacres and the Hutus who are victims  exactly like Tutsis, know that also," he added.
Before the resurgence in fighting, Tutsi's formed around nine percent of  Rwanda's 7.1 million population, with the vast majority of the remainder being  Hutus.
If the RPF takes power it will not act like a conqueror but will be ready  to "make alliances with all the parties would were not implicated in the  genocide," Rudasingwa said.
The Hutus and Tutsis had lived together in harmony for centuries, he went  on, and tensions only grew at the start of the colonial era "when the Belgians  used the Tutsi elite as collaborators."
"But the politicians of our country carry a heavier responsibility than  the Belgians," he added.
"Because they took up the colonial model voluntarily, down to the  passports where ethnic origin is indicated, the Rwandan politicians let slip a  chance to build a nation."
Germany was the first colonial power in Rwanda, followed by Belgium. The  country became independent in 1962.
