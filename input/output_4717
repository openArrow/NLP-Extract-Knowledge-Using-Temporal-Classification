Court officials compiled a list of assets belonging  to Saudi Arabia's defence minister at a flat here Friday in compliance with a  court order following a complaint about debts, a police source said.
The action was the second in a week at a flat belonging to Prince Sultan  ibn Abdel Aziz, brother of King Fahd.
Friday's action involved a court and police official drawing up a list of  furniture and assets at a house in the French capital, without removing them.  Last Friday an inventory was made at another Paris address.
The prince is minister for defence, aviation, and the inspector general of  the Saudi armed forces. He is considered the number three in the Saudi  hierarchy, after King Fahd and his heir, Emir Abdallah Ben Abdel Aziz.
Details of the debt complaint were not known, the police source said.
