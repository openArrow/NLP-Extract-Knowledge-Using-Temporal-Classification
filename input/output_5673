Northern forces have opened two new fronts in  their four-week war to capture the key southern city of Aden, with fierce  fighting around villages northwest of here, a military spokesman and  correspondents said Tuesday.
"The northerners have concentrated their troops and are indiscriminately  shelling schools and public buildings in the villages" 105 kilometers (62  miles) to the northwest in Lahij province, the spokesman said.
Southern troops loyal to Ali Salem al-Baid have "countered the northern  offensive" which began Monday, he said, adding that southern warplanes called  into battle had inflicted "heavy losses" on the enemy.
The north, he said, opened the new front "after its failure" on the fronts  at Al-Anad air base 60 kilometers north of Aden, and Bab al-Mandab/Kharaz, 120  kilometers (72 miles) west of here.
Correspondents also reported heavy fighting on another new front 60  kilometres (37 miles) west of here, with northern tanks, hidden in sand dunes,  firing shells at southern forces, who were firing multiple rocket launchers.
The two sides were also fighting on Tuesday along the Abyan front and at  Shabwa, both east of Aden.
Several MiG-21 fighter jets were spotted taking off from Aden airport.
The fighting comes as the UN Security Council was scheduled to examine the  civil war that broke out on May 5 between Baid's forces and those loyal to  Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Saleh.
Baid proclaimed a breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic on May 21, but it  has not been recognised internationally.
