Australian miner MIM Holdings Ltd.  announced here Monday the sale of its 3.5 percent stake in German metals  producer Metallgesellschaft AG.
MIM said in a statement it had sold all of its 304,657 shares in the  German company over the past few months at an average price of 247.29 marks  per share, worth about 62.5 million Australian dollars (45 million US).
The sale completes the unwinding of MIM's cross-shareholding in its former  German partner that has come about as part of the miner's global review of  assets and investments.
In December, Metallgesellschaft sold the 13.9 percent stake held in MIM by  its Canadian subsidiary, Metall Mining Corp., and in February MIM and  Metallgesellschaft agreed on a swap of their jointly held European smelter  assets.
MIM shares closed four cents higher at 3.27 dollars on the local bourse  Monday.
