A military tribunal judge has warned that  Israel's demand that Palestinian prisoners pledge support for autonomy before  being released is "deliberately anti-democratic".
Judge Shlomo Isaacson gave the ruling in the case of Walid el-Rol, a  member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine who refused to  sign part of the pledge and remained in jail.
About 700 men due for early release have refused to sign and remain in  jail.
El-Rol, who has spent nearly a year in jail, was one of hundreds of  Palestinians set for release by Israel following the May 4 Cairo agreement to  launch PLO autonomy.
He pledged "to abstain from all acts of terrorism and violence" -- the  first part of the release clause -- but refused to support the September 13  Declaration of Principles for autonomy.
Israeli civil rights lawyer Tamar Peleg took up the case.
"The second clause is totally illogical," Isaacson found in his May 24  verdict, which was disclosed Tuesday.
"One cannot ask an individual to give political backing to an idea. It is  a deliberately anti-democratic act. However it is legitimate to ask a detainee  not to commit acts of violence."
Nonetheless the judge prolonged his detention for another five weeks  stating El-Rol would "work to build a structure which opposes the peace  process by violent activities."
Israel set free another 78 Palestinian prisoners on Monday after a three  week lull in the releases.
A total of 1,579 Palestinians were released on May 4 and 5, but Israel  then halted the process without any explanation.
Under the Cairo accord, Israel has until June 8 to release 5,000  prisoners. Negotiations were to continue on the fate of the remaining  Palestinians in Israeli jails.
