The Cambodian government said Monday it would  agree to an unconditional ceasefire across Cambodia if peace talks with the  Khmer Rouge this week failed to achieve a political solution to the country's  civil war.
"We would like to express our support the king's initiative for a total,  unconditional ... ceasefire across all Cambodian territory," said the  statement signed by co-premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, and  National Assembly Chairman Chea Sim.
The statement, which was dated Sunday, said the ceasefire could not go  into effect until June 13, two weeks after the peace talks scheduled in  Pyongyang, but did not give a clear reason for the delay.
King Norodom Sihanouk has appealed to the government and Khmer Rouge for a  ceasefire and the creation of a monitoring commission of officers from both  sides if the peace talks due to begin Friday are not successful.
The statement also said that the government would accept the setting up of  the ceasefire commission headed by two neutral generals representing the king.
In another statement released by the Royal Palace, King Sihanouk expressed  his gratitude for the government's acceptance of his ceasefire proposal, but  suggested starting the ceasefire on June 15, without giving reasons.
Khmer Rouge nominal leader Khieu Samphan has agreed to participate in the  peace talks in Pyongyang, but has yet to respond to the appeal for a ceasefire.
A peace plan reported to have been put forward by King Sihanouk includes  giving certain "acceptable" members of the Khmer Rouge senior cabinet posts in  exchange for giving up their zones, ceasing all guerrilla activities, and  merging rebel fighters with the royal armed forces.
Government forces are currently pushing the Khmer Rouge back to their base  at northwest Pailin after the rebels launched an offensive that brought them  within striking distance of Cambodia's second city of Battambang.
