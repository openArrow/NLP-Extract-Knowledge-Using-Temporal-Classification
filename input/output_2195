Human rights violations by the Peruvian military  routinely go unpunished, Amnesty International chief Pierre Sane said Thursday  during a one-week trip to this Andean nation.
Sane also underscored his organization's backing of Peruvian human rights  groups, which are often accused of sympathizing with the Maoist Shining Path  whose 14-year war against the government has left 27,500 people dead in  addition to 5,000 disappeared.
Despite numerous allegations of wrongdoing by government troops, just  three soldiers have been tried and punished for extra-judicial executions,  said Sane, who is Amnesty International's secretary general.
"The government has not done everything it can with regards to  investigations, prosecutions and compensation for the families of the  victims," said the Amnesty International chief.
Sane, who met with relatives of the dead, disappeared and some political  prisoners, said he was concerned about what he called the "alarming" increase  in the number of innocent people picked up under anti-terrorist legislation.
The organization has declared 22 of them "prisoners of conscience" and is  considering 200 other cases.
The secretary general meets Friday with congressional president Jaime  Yoshiyama. President Alberto Fujimori had declined to meet with the Amnesty  International delegation.
