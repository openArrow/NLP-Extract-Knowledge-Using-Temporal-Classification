Michael Schumacher, who has won the first  four races of the season, improved his qualifying time in unofficial practice  here Saturday for the Spanish Grand Prix.
The second qualifying session had been slightly delayed by an accident to  Andrea Montermini.
The Italian, in his first Grand Prix meeting for Roland Ratzenberger who  was killed at San Marino, escaped unhurt when he crashed his Simtek-Ford.
Drivers and engineers in the paddocks held their breath as Montermini lost  control coming out of a bend, spun across the track and smashed the front of  his car into a low wall.
Former world champion Niki Lauda, who now heads the Grand Prix Drivers'  Association, said there was nothing anyone could do to prevent such an  accident.
"I haven't any solutions to this," the Austrian said.
Top teams had refused to race on Friday until motor racing authorities  agreed to a more flexible timetable for introducing changes to make the cars  slower and safer. They claimed the haste with which they were brought in had  only made the situation more dangerous.
The changes were rushed through after Brazil's triple world champion  Ayrton Senna and Ratzenberger were killed at San Marino and another Austrian,  Karl Wendlinger, suffered serious head injuries in a Monaco GP crash.
Schumacher timed 1min 22.084sec compared to the 1min 23.426sec he recorded  on Friday in his Benetton-Ford.
Damon Hill of Britain, in a Williams-Renault, was next on 1:22.432. He had  been third fastest in 1:24.716 in official qualifying.
Mika Hakkinen of Finland, who timed 1:24.580 in a McLaren-Peugeot on  Friday, was third fastest on 1:22.772.
David Coulthard, the 23-year-old Briton making his Grand Prix debut in  place of Senna, was fourth fastest on 122.929. The Williams-Renault  test-driver had been 16th-fastest in official qualifying in 1:27.428.
Martin Brundle of Britain was next on 1:23.846 in his McLaren-Peugeot.
Rubens Barrichello of Brazil, back after escaping with only a broken nose  after crashing at 180mph the day before Senna was killed at Imola, also  improved his qualifying time.
He recorded 1:24.530 in his Jordan-Hart compared to the 1:25.990 he set on  Friday.
