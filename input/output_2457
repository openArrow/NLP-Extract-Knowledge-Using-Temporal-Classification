Thirty men who fought in the  clandestine ranks of the armed wing of Fatah against Israel have joined the  new Palestinian police force, a PLO official told AFP on Friday.
Another 40 "Hawks" from the mainstream PLO group have applied to become  policemen since the May 4 agreement to launch autonomy in the Gaza Strip and  the West Bank town of Jericho, said the official.
All took part in the armed struggle and were listed as wanted by the  Israeli army until self-rule started.
"This is what I wanted to do," said Ahmad Abu Zayad, who received his blue  uniform and regulation issue Kalashnikov rifle earlier this week.
"As a policeman I will fight to build my country," he said proudly.
Abu Zayad said he was released from jail this month after serving less  than a year of a 20-year sentence for shooting at Israeli soldiers.
"Now our guns are all licensed and we cannot use them against the army or  collaborators any more," said the 25-year-old from Beit Lahia village, in  northern Gaza.
The cases of the 40 others were still under consideration by police  chiefs, said the official, who asked not to be named.
Some 3,000 former soldiers of the Palestine Liberation Army have entered  the Gaza Strip in the last two weeks to form the backbone of the new force.  More than 600 PLA soldiers are also in the West Bank town of Jericho.
The autonomy agreement allows for the force to have 9,000 men.
