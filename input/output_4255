A senior Iranian official accused Saudi Arabia on  Thursday of provoking the conflict in Yemen in a bid to weaken the country as  a potential threat.
Mohammad Javad Larijani, a member of Iran's National Security Council,  said Yemen's unity had "sparked fear in Riyadh's rulers over the dangers" of  having a strong country next door.
"Saudi leaders have been provoking the recent bloody clashes in Yemen  because they are worried about possible troubles," he said.
A radical newspaper here also accused Saudi Arabia of instigating the  conflict in its neighbour and of encouraging south Yemenis to break away.
"The Saudis have supported the leaders of south Yemen in creating problem  in the way of national unity," Jomhuri Islami said.
