For the second time in three weeks  spring storms created havoc on the PGA Tour Thursday, washing out play at the  Colonial tournament.
More than half the field even got on the course at the Colonial Country  club course at Fort Worth. The club is about 30 miles (48 km) from Dallas  where the Byron Nelson Classic was reduced to two rounds two weeks ago because  of rain and thunderstorms.
"This is not a recording," said PGA Tour official Duke Butler when he  announced the overnight delay.
No one in the 110-man field completed play and 57 had yet to tee off.
Officials hoped to complete the first round on Friday, with those still to  start playing a double round of 36 holes.
"We are striving to play 54 holes by Saturday afternoon, with the fourth  round Sunday," Butler said, but more rain is forecast for the weekend.
John Cook was the early leader at five-under with five holes to play.
Tom Lehman, winner of the Memorial last week, was four-under with three to  play.
Zimbabwe's Nick Price, South African David Frost, Hale Irwin, Bruce  Lietzke and Ken Green were all at three-under.
