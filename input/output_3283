Republic of Ireland boss Jack Charlton is facing a  World Cup crisis over the fitness of central defenders Paul McGrath and Alan  Kernaghan.
Both have missed their final club matches and Charlton will not risk them  in a warm-up friendly against Bolivia here on Tuesday unless they prove they  have recovered.
Aston Villa's McGrath, whose career has been blighted by knee problems, is  suffering from a strained shoulder.
Kernaghan, who also missed Ireland's most recent internationals against  Russia and Holland, is still feeling a damaged thigh muscle which prevented  him taking part in Manchester City's recent successful fight against  relegation from the Premier League.
Charlton said: "They both have strains and although both want to play  tomorrow night I am not prepared to risk anybody this close to the World Cup  finals."
