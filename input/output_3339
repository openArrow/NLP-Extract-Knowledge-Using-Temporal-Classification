At his disposal he has forwards Ernie Stewart (Willem II) and Eric Wynalda  (FC Saarbrucken), midfielder Tab Ramos (Real Betis), defenders Cle Kooiman  (Cruz Azul) Brian Bliss (Carl-Zeiss Jena), Thomas Dooley (FC Kaiserslautern)  and John Harkes (Derby County).
Roy Wegerle of Coventry City is battling to be fit after three knee  operations this year, the last on April 15.
Goalkeeper Tony Meola, with Dooley a favorite for the job of captain, will  be backed up by Brad Friedel and England-based player Juergen Sommers.
"It will be easy to select players 1-15," says assistant coach Steve  Sampson. "Players 16-22 will be difficult."
Last June the United States scored an historic 2-0 victory over England in  the US Cup 93, but such victories have been rare.
Barely more than a month after the triumph over England the Americans fell  4-0 to Mexico in the CONCACAF Gold Cup final.
In 16 matches this year, the United States have won four, drawn six and  lost six. The draws included a 1-1 result against Switzerland, who they meet  in their World Cup opener at the Silverdome in Detroit on June 18.
Despite those lacklustre results, Steinbrecher remains confident.
"I'm still pretty optimistic about our chances. I believe in these guys."
