Israeli troops killed a 60-year-old  Lebanese labourer in south Lebanon at dawn Wednesday when they mistook him for  a guerrilla, a UN officer and a pro-Israeli militiaman reported.
Rashid Mansur was setting off to work in a field in the central sector of  Israel's self-declared "security zone" when Israeli tanks fired shells killing  the farmer instantly, the officer serving with the UN in south Lebanon said.
A spokesman for the Israeli-financed South Lebanon Army (SLA) said the  Israelis "thought the man to be a member of a guerrilla group trying to  infiltrate a military road between Taybe and Antara."
They found his body when they went out to sweep through the region during   daylight, the spokesman said.
Israeli troops have been on alert for possible retaliation after commandos  snatched Moslem fundamentalist guerrilla chief Mustafa Dirani Saturday from  his home in Syrian-controlled eastern Lebanon to trace missing Israeli airman  Ron Arad, whose plane was shot down over south Lebanon in 1986.
