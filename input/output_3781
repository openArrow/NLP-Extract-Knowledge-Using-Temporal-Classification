Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. said  Wednesday its consolidated pre-tax earnings dived 16 percent from a year  earlier to 128 billion yen (1.2 billion dollars) in the year to March.
The country's biggest shipbuilder, defence contractor and nuclear power  plant concern, said sales slipped 1.4 percent to 2,784 billion yen, depressed  by lower revenue from most activities except power systems which were flat.
Mitsubishi Heavy offered no group forecast for this year but said parent  company earnings, which tumbled 15.3 percent to 119 billion yen, were expected  to stage a partial recovery to 130 billion yen. Parent sales, which dropped  2.3 percent to 2,435 billion yen, are expected to rise to 2,500 billion yen.
In the year just ended, revenue from the company's shipbuilding and steel  structure operations edged down 0.1 percent 448 billion yen while power  systems revenue was flat at 683 billion yen.
Machinery sales dived 8.2 percent to 517 billion yen and revenue from  aircraft and special vehicles such as tanks fell 0.2 percent to 456 billion  yen. Sales of general machinery and components along with airconditioning and  refrigeration systems dropped 3.2 percent to 331 billion yen.
