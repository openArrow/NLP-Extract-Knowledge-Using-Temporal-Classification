The president of the breakaway Caucasus republic of  Chechnya, Dzhokar Dudayev, has escaped an assassination attempt in which his  interior minister and deputy were killed, Dudayev's spokesman said Saturday.
Spokesman Movladi Udugov said that on Friday evening, a remote-controlled  booby-trapped Zhiguli car exploded as the president's motorcade was passing.
Chechnya is a Moslem republic in southern Russia which has declared  independence.
Udugov said that General Dudayev was returning to the Chechnya capital  from his native village of Zakan-Yurt, some 20 kilometres (12 miles) away.
The attack was not linked to a hostage-taking in the Russian Caucasus  region which ended in Chechnya on Friday, Udugov said.
