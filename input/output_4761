Diego Maradona will just twiddle his thumbs if  Argentina's coach Alfio Basile slaps a sex ban on his players during the World  Cup.
"You have to respect what your trainer decides," Maradona said. "He has  said our wives can accompany us to the United States but if he changes his  mind I will just have to twiddle my thumbs."
Maradona, speaking after Argentina's 1-0 defeat against Equador here on  Wednesday, said there was no obvious successor to him in the World Cup side  but added: "Claudio Caniggia is one of the best players I have seen in my  life."
