Nigeria's newest political movement urged the  military government on Monday to call on Chief Moshood Abiola, barred from  heading a civilian government last year, to form a broad-based national  government by the end of the month.
The National Democratic Coalition, set up last Friday despite a ban on  political gatherings since General Sani Abacha took power in November, said  Nigerians should boycott a constitutional conference the authorities were  planning for June 27.
"The military government is not qualified by its antecedents, disposition  and track record, and has no moral standing whatsoever to organise a proper  sovereign national conference as desired by Nigerians," the movement said in a  communique.
It added: "The oft-repeated claim by successive military administrations  that civilians are to engage in a democratic learning process established and  supervised by the military is fraudulent and insulting."
An official of the new grouping, speaking anonymously, said it would  threaten street demonstrations or a mass civil disobedience campaign if its  demands were not met.
Abiola was the apparent winner of a general election last June to restore  civilian rule, declared free and fair by international observers, but then  military ruler General Ibrahim Babangida annulled the vote, alleging  malpractice.
The Campaign for Democracy, a coalition of some 40 pro-democracy and human  rights groups, said Monday it planned three days of ceremonies as from June 12  to mark the first anniversary. People would be asked to wear black in  mourning, and church services and candle light processions would be staged in  major cities, the campaign's secretary-general Sylvester Odion-Akhaine said.
