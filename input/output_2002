North Korea's news agency said Thursday that Japan  is seeking to revive militarism and should not become a permanent member of  the United Nations Security Council.
"It is only too clear that a war criminal, a nuclear criminal, cannot  become a permanent member of the UN Security Council," the Korean Central News  Agency (KCNA) said in a report monitored here.
It said that recent remarks by Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  represented a "mockery of the unbiased opinion of the international community  which has consistently opposed Japan's shameless attempt to obtain a permanent  seat in the UN Security Council."
"Now, Japan is scheming to call back the militarist specter of the past,  crudely violating the UN charter," KCNA said. "As the international community  opines fairly, Japan has neither justification nor elementary qualification to  hold a responsible position in the UN Security Council."
