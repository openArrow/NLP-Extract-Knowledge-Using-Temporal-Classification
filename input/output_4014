New Zealand were forced to follow on by  Yorkshire on Wednesday as all-rounder Craig White pressed his case to torment  the Kiwis all over again in next week's first Test.
The tourists require another 137 to make Yorkshire bat again with one day  to go, and desperately need a morale boost before they face England once more.
White, who took five wickets for 42 after a first-day 59, made the crucial  breakthrough when he dismissed captain Ken Rutherford lbw for 33 to end a  stand of 66 with Blair Hartland.
Eleven balls later, he had out-of-form Mark Greatbatch caught behind for a  duck as he gained lift and movement from an easy-paced pitch.
White went on to end Hartland's stubborn resistance and also dismissed  Stephen Fleming and Adam Parore in a 15-over spell, watched by England's  chairman of selectors Ray Illingworth.
He then grabbed a second innings wicket as the Kiwis, all out for 173 in  the first innings, reached 98 for one at the close.
White had Blair Pocock caught at third man by substitute Chris Silverwood  to end an opening stand of 70.
Hartland again defied Yorkshire gallantly and when bad light brought a  premature close he was unbeaten on 60 having reached his half-century from 63  balls with 10 fours.
