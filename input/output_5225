Former communists are set to take an absolute  majority in the Hungarian parliament after four years of conservative rule,  according to initial results from run-off elections Sunday.
With 57.36 percent of the votes counted in 174 constituencies where the  winner needed only a simple majority, the Hungarian Socialist Party was in the  lead in 146 and had already secured 71 seats outright.
Added to the 55 seats it gained in the first round of voting on May 8,  this would give the party 201 seats -- seven more than the 194 needed for an  absolute majority in the 386-member assembly.
Earlier the Szonda-Ipsos institute predicted that the socialists, led by  former foreign minister Gyula Horn would win 208 of the 386 seats. Another  pollster, the Median Institute, gave it 196 seats in Hungary's second  democratic election since the fall of communism in 1989.
The party is made up of former communists and had only 33 seats in the  outgoing parliament.
The liberal Alliance of Free Democrats was in second place, and would gain  75 seats, according to Szonda-Ipsos, 84 according to Median.
Political analysts said Hungary's future government would likely be a  coalition between these two parties in order to achieve the two-thirds  majority required to pass major legislation.
Democratic Forum, the main force in the outgoing administration with 165  seats, is predicted to win 34 seats according to Szonda-Ipsos, 36 according to  Median.
Its coalition partner, the Small Independent Proprietors Party, is  predicted to win 25 or 26 seats.
The pollsters give the Christian Democrats, another coalition partner, 20  or 19 seats, and the liberal Federation of Young Democrats 21 or 20, with  remaining seats going to the very small parties.
The Gallup organisation predicted a socialist majority after pre-election  polling, but was not conducting exit-polls Sunday.
The first round of the election was held May 8.
