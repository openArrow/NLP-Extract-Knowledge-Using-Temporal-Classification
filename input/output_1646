PLO chief Yasser Arafat will travel to the new  Palestinian self-rule areas of Gaza and Jericho in the first week of June, his  political advisor Nabil Shaath told AFP here on Wednesday.
Shaath did not say which area Arafat would go to first. He said he would  accompany "Mr Arafat, president of the Palestinian Authority in the autonomous  territories."
Other Palestinian sources said Arafat would arrive in Gaza on June 5.  Arafat's schedules and plans are generally kept secret for security reasons.
Shaath spoke after returning to Cairo from a trip to Tunis where he  attended a meeting of the revolutionary committee of Fatah, the PLO's  mainstream faction.
He is among those nominated by Arafat to take part in the Palestinian  Authority which is to administer the autonomous zones.
