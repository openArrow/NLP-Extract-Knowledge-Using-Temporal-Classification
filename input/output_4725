The International Organisation of Migration (IOM)  launched a 335,000 dollar appeal Friday to help repatriate about 4,500  immigrant workers trapped in Yemen by the civil war.
The workers mainly Filippinos, Egyptians and Palestinians are mostly  employed in large hotels in the southern stronghold of Aden, IOM public  relations director Peter Schatzer said.
The Philippines has called on the IOM to help it evacuate its nationals to  safety.
Schatzer added the appeal, sent to 15 countries as well as the European  Union, had been well received in Germany.
Fighting has raged outside the port of Aden since the war erupted between  rival north and south Yemeni forces on May 5.
