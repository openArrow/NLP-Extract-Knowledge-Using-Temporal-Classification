French bankers seeking to recover huge debts from  flamboyant soccer boss and self-made millionaire Bernard Tapie on Friday sent  bailiffs into his chic Paris home to assess a collection of 18th century  French furniture, paintings and works of art.
The furniture was not removed from his residence, situated on the left  bank of the river Seine, but Tapie is henceforth unable to dispose of it.
Tapie, president of the recently-relegated football club Olympique  Marseille, was present during the inventory.
The state-owned Credit Lyonnais, which is debt-ridden, is owed a total of  180 million dollars by Tapie, of which 61 million dollars are due immediately.
In a communique Friday, the bank said a March 13 agreement with Tapie for  rescheduling of his debt, with a mortgage on his property, had lapsed.
The communique said Tapie's assets had reduced in value since March 13,  following a customs prosecution against the tycoon concerning his yacht the  Phocea and the relegation to the second division of Olympique Marseille.
The club was relegated for its role in an alleged match-rigging scandal.
