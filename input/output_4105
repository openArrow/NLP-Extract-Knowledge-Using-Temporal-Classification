Northern forces fired two missiles at the  southern capital Aden early Thursday, but one plunged into the sea and the  other was destroyed by defending fire, witnesses said.
The Soviet-made Lunas were aimed at the airport, and some parked cars were  damaged by part of the one which was hit by fire from anti-missile batteries.
The other landed harmlessly off shore, the witnesses said.
A missile killed four people here on Sunday, while at least 13 people died  and more than 100 were wounded when the northern capital Sanaa was hit by a  missile on Monday.
The warring Yemeni armies fought intense artillery duels on their main  battle fronts Wednesday, and the sound of shellfire could be heard in Aden.
Correspondents have been unable to return to the key base of Al-Anad north  of here because of fierce fighting.
