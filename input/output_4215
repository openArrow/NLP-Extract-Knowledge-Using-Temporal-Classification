Palestinian gunmen slightly wounded an Israeli  soldier in an ambush on a patrol near Rafah on the Gaza Strip on Thursday,  military sources said.
But the hardline Moslem group Islamic Jihad, claiming responsibility for  the attack in a statement faxed to AFP in Nicosia, said it had killed two  Israeli soldiers and seriously wounded two others.
The troops were aboard a jeep inside the autonomous territory when they  were fired on by the gunmen, who then fled, Israeli military sources said.
The Jihad said it carried out the attack in "retaliation for the Zionist  provocations, and the kidnapping of Mustafa Dirani," the Moslem Shiite  pro-Iranian guerilla leader snatched by an Israeli helicopter-borne commando  from his village in eastern Lebanon Saturday.
Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the killing Friday of two  soldiers on the autonomous Gaza Strip.
The group has vowed to torpedo the May 4 Israel-PLO agreement on self-rule  in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho.
The Palestinians took over control of the Gaza Strip last week, but  Israeli troops are still deployed to protect Jewish settlements.
