Next year's Cannes Film Festival -- the  48th -- has been ousted from its normal mid-May slot to make way for France's  presidential elections, festival sources said Friday.
The world's largest filmfest will take place from May 17-28 next year, a  week later than its usual prime position in the calendar of the world's film  industry.
The exact dates of the French presidential election has not been fixed.  The first round is due to take place at the end of April, with the second  round two weeks later.
The Cannes International Film Festival traditionally starts on a Thursday  in the second week of May, and finishes with the selection of the winner of  the Golden Palm on the Monday 11 days later.
