Paintings by French Impressionists Paul Cezanne,  Auguste Renoir and Paul Gauguin are among 28 works stolen by Nazi troops  during World War II about to be returned to France, French officials said  Tuesday.
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Monday gave French President Francois  Mitterrand an untitled Claude Monet painting from the 1870s, showing the  snow-covered Louveciennes road west of Paris.
It is one of 28 works found in the east Berlin museum, the Stadtgalerie,  after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and to be returned to French museums  pending claims by their rightful owners.
The French foreign ministry said that among seven already claimed by two  families, who asked to remain anonymous, are:
- Camille Corot "Lisiere de bois"
- Camille Corot "Paysage avec arbres et personnages"
- Paul Gauguin "Falaise"
The other four include two works by Henri Harpignies and two by  Henri-Edmond Cross.
Of the 21 as yet unclaimed paintings, four are by unknown artists, from  the French School, the Fontainebleau School and the Dutch School of painting.
Among the better-known works are:
- Eugene Delacroix "Portrait de jeune homme avec beret bleu"
- Eugene Delacroix "Jeune fille assise avec un livre sur les genoux"
- Gustave Courbet "Paysage avec rochers en Franche-Comte"
- Adolphe Monticelli "Paysage de foret avec personnage a bonnet rouge"

Germany has pledged to return all the works to their onetime owners, where  possible.
