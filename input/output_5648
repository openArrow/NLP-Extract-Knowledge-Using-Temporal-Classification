The opposition Democratic Revolution Party  (PRD) said that some four million names have been erased from the voter lists  needed for the August presidential polls.
PRD official Samuel del Villar said in a televised debate late Monday that  two separate voter lists had been drawn up, and orders had been issued to have  them both destroyed to hide any evidence of tampering.
Villar said there was an identity match between the Federal Electoral  Registry, the government and the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party  (PRI) since several members of the registry were also PRD members.
Registry director Carlos Almada denied Villar's charges in the debate,  saying that the voter lists were 96 percent accurate, comprising 47 million  Mexicans of voting age, 44 million of whom have received their voting cards.
As to the charges of conflict of interest, Almada said the debate was no  place to discuss the "personal biographies" of registry members.
Villar said that by comparing the 1990 census with the electoral lists  there was a discrepancy of more than four million self employed and Mexicans  of voting age living outside the country.
Almada said there could be no comparison between the two lists and that  the after 36 scrutinies the registry was judged to be 96 percent reliable.
He attributed the four percent margin of error to the shifting population  and to mistakes on the part of voters and, "of course," the government.
The PRI has won every election for the past 65 years and has regularly  withstood charges of vote fraud.
The August presidential elections will choose the successor to President  Carlos Salinas. The Mexican constitution allows only one five-year term in  office.
