Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze has offered  to resign after legislators refused to ratify a draft accord settling the  separatist conflict in Abkhazia, a deputy said.
Legislators said they would draw up a draft of their own, different from  the one hammered out by a government delegation and Abkhazian envoys and  mediated by Russia.
Former Georgian prime minister and deputy, Tengiz Sigua, told journalists  after the parliament meeting Friday that Shevardnadze offered his resignation  as he had failed to win support for the draft.
Early Friday Georgian deputies were given a first glimpse of the draft  which is to be signed in Moscow Sunday in the presence of representatives from  the United Nations and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
The draft calls for a 12-kilometer (seven-mile) security zone in the Gali  region in southern Abkhazia, where Commonwealth of Independent States troops  and UN observers will be deployed, the Iprinda news agency reported.
Some deputies fear the security zone will definitely bar access to  Abkhazia from Georgia, and said the negotiated settlement was tantamount to  "surrender."
Shevardnadze stepped down for a few hours last September 14 after  parliament refused to grant him special powers to impose a state of emergency  because of the worsening crisis in Abkhazia.
