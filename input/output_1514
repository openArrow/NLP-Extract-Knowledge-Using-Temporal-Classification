Bombers blasted an empty beach police  station early Wednesday at Bidart, an Atlantic resort some 10 kilometres (six  miles) southwest of this southern French city in the Basque country, police  said.
The blast badly damaged the single-storey building, as well as shops and  apartment blocks up to 100 metres (yards) away, but no injuries were reported.
Paramilitary police stopped traffic on highway 10, linking Bayonne and  Hendaye near the border with Spain, as they searched the area.
It was the first attack in the French Basque country since October 13,  when suspected Basque separatists wrecked part of the law courts in Bayonne  with a car bomb.
