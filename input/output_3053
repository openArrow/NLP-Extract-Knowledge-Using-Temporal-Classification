The explosion triggered a panic and damaged nearby buildings, according to  authorities who believe the bomb was planted by the National Guerrilla  Coordinator, which has threatened attacks ahead of the May 29 presidential  elections.
The five policemen had been on patrol in the in commercial district in  Medellin, Colombia's second largest city and the seat of the country's  powerful drug cartels.
Three of the policemen were killed in the blast and two others died while  being treated by paramedics. Two other policemen and four civilians were also  injured in the explosion, which left a huge hole in the pavement.
A witness said on a local radio report that the police car was the only  vehicle in the area.
