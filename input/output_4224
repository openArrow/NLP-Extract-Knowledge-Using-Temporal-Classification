Boeing Company is close to reaching a deal with  China for more than 50 commercial jets valued at more than five billion  dollars, The Wall Street Journal said Thursday.
Citing unnamed sources familiar with the talks, the Journal said the  negotiations are in their final stages, awaiting the pending US decision on  whether to extend China's most-favored-nation trading status.
President Bill Clinton is expected to extend China's trade privileges,  informed sources said Wednesday in Washington. An announcement was expected as  early as Thursday.
The Journal quoted an official close to the Boeing talks as saying the  deal may be completed within about 10 days.
A spokesman for Boeing, which is based in Seattle, Washington, only told  the newspaper, "Serious discussions are under way. MFN is the big question  right now."
The negotiations could produce orders for as many as 15 each of Boeing's  new twin-engine 777 jetliners, the midsize 757 jets and the smallest 737  planes, the newspaper said. The deal also was expected to include orders for  less than 10 wide-bodied 747-400 jumbo jets.
Most of the aircraft would be built for Air China, with deliveries to be  made between 1996 and 1998, the paper said.
In recent years Boeing, the world's largest airliner maker, has cut  production as demand fell in the recession-strapped global market.
Boeing counts on China for about 14 percent of its commercial aircraft  orders. Although that demand has slowed, too, it has been strong enough to  allow Boeing to avoid deeper production cuts.
