Taiwan's High Court has upheld a ten-year jail  sentence on a Chinese man who hijacked a passenger airliner to Taipei,  judicial officials said Tuesday.
Zhang Hai was jailed by a district court for hijacking a Chinese airliner  to Taiwan on November 5 last year.
Armed with two daggers and a fake explosive, Zhang, 27, from China's Henan  province, diverted the the Xiamen Airlines Boeing 737 plane to Taiwan.
Zhang, who says he is a pro-democracy activist in China, Tueday vowed to  appeal to the supreme court for a lighter sentence.
He said he and another hijacker, Li Xianyu who diverted a China Northern  Airlines MD82 to Taiwan on November 12, would stage a week-long hunger strike  from Wednesday in memory of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre by Chinese  troops against pro-democracy students.
