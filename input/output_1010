Peace talks between Sudanese government and rebels  deadlocked here Monday, forcing a last-minute postponement of the signing of  an acccord on passage of humanitarian aid in the war-torn south, a Kenyan  foreign ministry source said.
The agreement on surface and air corridors for passage of relief supplies  had been worked out last week at behind-the-scene consultations between  Sudan's Islamic fundamentalist military government and representatives of the  two factions of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA).
However, one of the factions had apparently reneged and failed to show up  to sign the final draft drawn at the weekend, the foreign ministry source said.
Although the source declined to say which of the two factions -- John  Garang's mainstream SPLA and Riek Machar's SPLA-United -- was involved in the  last-minute dispute, other sources said Garang's representative had not  arrived at the Kenyan foreign ministry where the talks are being held under  the chairmanship of Kenyan foreign minister Kalonzo Musyoka.
Khartoum's delegation, led by parliamentary speaker Mohamed al-Amin  Khalifa, was to meet members of the SPLA's two rival factions in the latest of  many negotiations organised by the six-member region group, the  Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD).
Only a representative of the breakaway SPLA-United faction, Richard Mulla,  had showed up for the talks, foreign ministry officials said.
