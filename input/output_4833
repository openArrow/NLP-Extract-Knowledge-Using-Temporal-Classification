Share prices on Wall Street remained closely tied  to long-term interest rates this past week, with stocks closing Friday  slightly down as interest rates edged up slightly.
A slight drop in long-term interest rates the previous week following the  Federal Reserve's latest decision to tighten monetary policy pushed up share  prices more than 100 points.
But the Dow Jones index of 30 blue chips closed Friday at 3,757.14, down  9.21 points (0.24 percent) for the week. Volume dropped as investors left  early for the Memorial Day holiday weekend.
The week began with a surge in long-term interest rates on Monday as  primary products prices shot up on speculative buying.
The rates came down again as the United States and Japan agreed to resume  trade talks, the Treasury Department's auction of five-year bonds went well  and because of profit-taking on commodity markets.
But interest rates rose again slightly Thursday and even more on Friday  following an unexpected revision of US economic growth for the first quarter.
