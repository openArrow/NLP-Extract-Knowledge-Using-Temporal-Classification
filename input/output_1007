England are to play the West Indies in a six-Test  home series for the first time ever next summer.
The sides will also play three one-day matches.
The sides normally play five Tests in England but Test and County Cricket  Board spokesman Tim Lamb said: "The West Indies are a very attractive team and  this way all six of our Test match grounds get an opportunity to stage one  match each in the series."
The change of programme means Sri Lanka will not play a Test in England  next year. They have been given one-off matches at the end of the last three  West Indian tours but the timing of their next visit to this country is now  uncertain.
First Test: Headingley, starting June 8, 1995
Second: Lord's, June 22
Third: Edgbaston, July 6
Fourth: Old Trafford, July 27
Fifth: Trent Bridge, August 10
Sixth: The Oval, August 24
One-day internationals:
Trent Bridge, Wednesday, May 24 1995; The Oval, Friday, May 26; Lord's,  Sunday, May 28.
