A fourth national daily is set to join the already  competitive Chinese media market here, sparking what some believe will be a  circulation war as vigorous as any involving media moguls Rupert Murdoch and  Kerry Packer.
Backed by Taiwanese capital, the "Independence Daily" will hit the streets  Friday with wrap-around colour, an initial target circulation of 15,000 and  high hopes of putting a copy into every Taiwanese household in Australia.
Independence Daily estimates the Taiwanese population at 40,000-50,000,  but its editors hope their special blend of Australian and Asian news spiced  with Australian lifestyle features will be the recipe to appeal to a bigger  audience -- all of Australia's Chinese-language community.
Its competitors are the Hong Kong-oriented Sing Tao Jih Pao launched in  1982, the locally-financed Chinese Herald started in 1986 and the Australian  Chinese Daily started in 1987 and focused predominantly on mainland China.
According to the 1991 census, Chinese language speakers in all variations  made up almost 300,000 of Australia's population of 17 million, but it has  grown rapidly since and is still growing, partly because of the exodus from  Hong Kong in the run up to China regaining sovereignty in 1997.
Chinese language readers from the mainland, Indochina, Singapore, Malaysia  and elsewhere in Asia are also increasingly heavily represented.
The new paper's deputy editor-in-chief Wilson Ng, formerly of Sing Tao,  agreed the Chinese community was already well-served with three dailies, but  believed his new paper had found a gap in the market.
"Although we are focused particularly on the Taiwanese community, we hope  to appeal to all of the Chinese-language community. We think we are that bit  different and we will be the first with colour.
"I think the Chinese media is becoming increasingly important in  Australia."
