Al Unser Jnr overcame a slow first  lap to capture the early pole position for the 78th Indianapolis 500 here  Saturday.
Unser, the 1992 Indy 500 champion, completed a four-lap qualifying run on  the 2.5-mile (4km) oval at 228.011 mph (364.817 km/h) to lead 13 qualifiers  before rain halted time trials after two hours.
Morning rain that delayed the start of qualifying kept Unser cautious on  his first lap, achieving only 225.722 mph (361.115 km/h). But his next three  laps were the fastest so far in time trials, increasing on each circuit and  peaking at 229.481 mph (367.169 km/h).
"I ran into that rain in turn one this morning (in practice) and it scared  the heck out of me," Unser said. "I wanted to check out the car and make sure  everything was working all right."
Unser's car owner, Roger Penske, was pleased with the reliability of the  Mercedes engine, which has dominated practice all month.
"Al never really had a chance to run it hard into turn one and he likes to  make sure everything is all right," Penske said. "The next three laps were  oustanding though."
Brazil's Raul Boesel and Canadian rookie Jacques Villeneuve were on the  early front row beside Unser, with Michael Andretti, Nigel Mansell and Arie  Luyendyk in row two. Villeneuve is the fastest rookie qualifier in Indy 500  history.
England's Nigel Mansell, the reigning Indy-car series champion, was fifth  fastest at 224.041 mph (358.465 km/h). His run came less than five minutes  before the rain stopped qualifying.
"The car was running slower," Mansell said. "As the front came in, there  was more humidity in the air and it slowed us down a bit. I'm just happy we  got the run in and we can concentrate on the race."
