More than 1,000 people <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">lined</EVENT> the gray, windswept street outside for a  glimpse of the funeral, <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">transmitted</EVENT> live in churches throughout Britain.&#13;
One of them was Westminster Central Hall, across from the House of Commons  where Smith's oratorical skills had been legendary.

Here in his hometown, taxi drivers <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">donned</EVENT> black ties in hommage to the  politician.&#13;
Smith, whose staid, Scottish banker-like appearance <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">belied</EVENT> his rapier wit  and stinging rhetoric, was <EVENT eid="e12" class="I_STATE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">liked</EVENT> and <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">respected</EVENT> throughout the political  spectrum. He <EVENT eid="e14" class="STATE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">had</EVENT> no apparent enemies.&#13;

Smith was most commonly <EVENT eid="e16" class="PERCEPTION" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">seen</EVENT> as a man of the people, close to his Scottish  roots, and, <EVENT eid="e17" class="REPORTING" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">according</EVENT> to numerous opinion surveys was <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">headed</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">become</EVENT> prime  minister after the next general <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">elections</EVENT> in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE">1996</TIMEX3>.&#13;

He was one of us, not one of them. He was on the side of the people,  and they <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">knew</EVENT> it."&#13;
Those who <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">remembered</EVENT> Smith as "dark sober-suited and safe" did not <EVENT eid="e25" class="I_STATE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="NEG" modality="none">know</EVENT>  the man, <EVENT eid="e26" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT> Dewar, <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">drawing</EVENT> smiles from Smith's widow, Elizabeth and  daughters Sarah, 25, Jane, 23 and Catherine, 20.&#13;

"He <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">enjoyed</EVENT> people and loyalty was the prime virtue.
