Fredrik Lindgren of Sweden overshot the last two  greens to drop shots but will still take a one stroke advantage into the final  round of the Italian Open here on Sunday.
In glorious sunshine on Saturday, the 28-year-old who is based in  Marbella, Spain, had a 69 for a 12-under par 204, just ahead of Argentinian  Eduardo Romero and England's Paul Eales.
Veteran South African John Bland is in fourth place after a bogey free 69  left him on ten under par 206.
Lindgren, bidding to become the seventh first-time winner on the European  tour this season, was two behind Eales at one point.
But four straight birdies from the 11th swept him three clear before the   two three-iron shots at the closing holes brought the chasing pack onto his  heels again.
"It's left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. It's much more fun to have  any bogeys early and then make birdies later on," said Lindgren.
"Maybe I was pumped up - or maybe it was just that the air was so hot  today that the ball went further.
"They were mistakes but I'm not too worried. I am enjoying my golf now and  managing not to get too uptight."
Eales, who can go top of Europe's Order of Merit with the 75,000 first  prize on Sunday, complained about his green work after his 70.
"I need to work on my putting," the winner of Spain's Extremadura Open in  February, said. "I pulled a three-foot putt wide of the hole on the tenth,  then started pushing the ball.
"But from tee to green I've hit the ball better each day and I'm confident  about tomorrow."
Romero, who fired 69, has not won since the 1992 Argentine PGA  championship and his last success in Europe was the 1991 French Open.
The 39-year-old has been undergoing swing changes with his father, a club  professional in Cordoba, and is starting to feel comfortable with them.
He was five adrift of Lindgren with four to play, but pitched to six feet  at the 15th and a yard on the next.
