At least 600 Kurdish families have crossed the  border into Iran in recent days to flee fighting among rival Kurdish factions  in northern Iraq, Resalat newspaper said here Tuesday.
The paper said most of the refugees were from the northeastern cities of  Khurmal and Halabja near the Iranian border.
Tehran radio said Monday that fighting had intensified between the two  major factions in northern Iraq -- the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and  Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) -- in the regions of Arbil, Qaleh-Dizeh,  Sulaymaniah, Haj-Omran and Halabja.
Thousands of Kurds fled their homes, it said.
Northern Iraq has been under Kurdish control since an uprising in the wake  of the January-February 1991 war which ejected Iraq from Kuwait.
