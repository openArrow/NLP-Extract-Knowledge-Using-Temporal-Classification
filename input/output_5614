Opinions differ greatly, both in Japan and in the  United States, about whether the Japanese emperor Akihito should go to Pearl  Harbor during his visit to the United States, according to polls conducted in  both countries.
A visit by emperor Akihito and empress Michiko to Pearl Harbor, site of  Japan's surprise attack on a US fleet in 1941 which brought the United States  into World War II, was formally dropped Friday from the upcoming June 10 to 26  tour under growing conservative pressure.
In the Japanese poll conducted by the Asahi Shimbun, 39 percent of the  respondents believed a visit to Pearl Harbor should have been included in the  itinerary, while 38 percent said it should not.
According to the US poll reported by the Asahi, 44 percent of the  respondents felt the emperor should visit Pearl Harbor, while 47 percent said  he should not.
Nonetheless, 62 percent of the Japanese and 50 percent of the US  respondents think that the imperial visit to the United States will help  improve the strained relations between Japan and the United States.
The surveys showed that young people in both nations are more open-minded  to the issue, with a majority of Japanese in their 20s and Americans aged  between 18 and 24 saying they wanted the emperor to visit Pearl Harbor.
In Japan, the newspaper conducted a nationwide telephone poll of 2,000  eligible voters during last weekend, immediately after the official  announcement of the imperial US visit. Among them, 60 percent responded.
In the United States, 1,253 people were questioned by phone from May 23 to  26.
