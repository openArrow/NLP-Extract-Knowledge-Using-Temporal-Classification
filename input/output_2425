South African President Nelson Mandela met  his land affairs minister Friday to discuss reports that former president  Frederik de Klerk handed vast tracts of land to Zulu monarch Goodwill  Zwelithini.
Land Affairs Minister Derek Hanekom told the domestic SAPA news agency  that the deal would be discussed between Mandela and De Klerk, now Mandela's  deputy, on Monday.
The Weekly Mail and Guardian newspaper reported Friday that De Klerk had  transferred controlled of three million hectares of state land to Zwelithini  just before he was voted out of office in South Africa's historic all-race  election of April 26-29.
The newspaper said the deal had been made in order to convince Zwelithini  and his uncle, Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, to  reverse their boycott of the watershed vote.
The two Zulu leaders did decide to support the election only a week before  polling, and the IFP went to win control of KwaZulu-Natal province and gain  three cabinet seats in the government of national unity.
The Weekly Mail said Mandela, Hanekom and other senior officials of the  African National Congress (ANC), as well as leading government ministers, were  unaware of the "highly secretive" deal.
The newspaper said the land was ceded to a trust controlled by Zwelithini  and was now effectively private land and could not be used by the ANC-led  government for redistribution to blacks.
