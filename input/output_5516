New Zealand's bowling injury crisis reached  desperate proportions on Monday at the end of their drawn match with Essex.
Chris Pringle, who pulled out of three-day match after injuring himself in  Saturday's warm-up, may have a ruptured disc in his back and, with the first  Test against England only three days away, his tour prospects look bleak.
Now Michael Owens, already lacking match fitness after joining the tour  late as a replacement for shoulder injury victim Simon Doull, is himself in  danger of missing Thursday's start at Nottingham with a groin strain.
Strike bowler Danny Morrison, who has only played one first-class match on  tour because of groin and hamstring problems, may be pitched in at Trent  Bridge.
Of the tourists' three completely fit seamers, Heath Davis and Gavin  Larsen have yet to play a Test, while Dion Nash has just three Test caps to  his name.
Captain Ken Rutherford said: "Pringle can hardly move. We're very  concerned and it doesn't look good for him.
"We're getting paranoid about our bowlers' fitness now. Every time we go  into the nets for practice we're expecting a bowler to pull up."
Davis did not ease fears about his wayward style, his 12 overs costing 72  runs for the wicket of Ronnie Irani, who edged to second slip.
All-rounder Irani, who resumed on 16, went to a career-best 83 as Essex  reached 334.
The Kiwis batted out time in front of a remarkably large Bank Holiday  crowd, who at least had sunshine to console them for the lack of positive  cricket.
Martin Crowe, scoring just 14, failed for the second time in the match,  adding to New Zealand's worries. He has now made only 190 runs in seven  first-class innings on tour.
