A hand grenade was lobbed into the courtyard of a  Shiite mosque in Karachi on Saturday in an attack police said appeared to be  linked to friction between rival Moslem groups.
No-one was reported injured, but officials said security had been  tightened to prevent an outbreak of new sectarian violence.
The southern port city, still recovering from violence that has seen 30  deaths, was jittery amid reports of four bomb blasts around dawn.
But police denied the report by the official Associated Press of Pakistan.  They said blasting in a nearby stone quarry might have been mistaken for bomb  blasts.
The mosque attack appeared linked to friction between groups from the  minority Shiite and majority Sunni Moslem communities. But police said they  had no immediate clue as to the identity of the attackers.
Last month, five people were injured when a grenade exploded in another  Shi'ite worship place.
Apart from the sectarian trouble, the city of over 10 million people has  been hit by ethnic violence. The 30 deaths were in clashes between police and  Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM).
MQM represents the large Urdu-speaking community of people who migrated  from India after the partition of the sub-continent in 1947.
The party has accused the government victimizing the Mohajir people, an  allegation denied by the authorities.
The army has been deployed throughout Sind province, of which Karachi is  capital, since June 1992 to reduce the crime rate and control ethnic and  sectarian violence.
The MQM contested last October's elections to the provincial legislature,  taking 27 seats in its urban strongholds of Karachi and Hyderabad.
The MQM is at loggerheads with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's ruling  Pakistan People's Party. Several MQM leaders, including four senators and the  leader of the opposition in the Sind, Assembly are currently in detention.
The MQM claims more than 2,000 of its supporters have been arrested from  Karachi alone.
