Court authorities rejected Tuesday an  appeal for the release of World War II collaborator Paul Touvier, jailed for  life last month for crimes against humanity, judicial officials said.
Touvier, 79, intelligence chief in the pro-Nazi militia in Lyon, filed the  appeal earlier in the day to the appeal court in this Paris suburb.
The hearing took place Tuesday morning behind closed doors in Touvier's  presence.
Touvier was jailed for life on April 20 for ordering the execution of  seven Jewish hostages on June 29, 1944 in reprisal for the killing a day  earlier by the French Resistance of Philippe Henriot, propaganda chief in the  Vichy puppet government.
Touvier escaped justice for four decades and was twice condemned to death  in absentia before being arrested at a Catholic priory in the southeastern  city of Nice on May 24, 1989.
His lawyer, Jacques Tremolet de Villers, termed his client's detention  "illegal," as last month's sentence failed to annul the legal terms of his  July 1991 release from earlier detention on health grounds.
Tremolet de Villers told reporters outside the court there was no  justification in law for keeping Touvier in jail.
He added the former militiaman had lost five kilos (11 pounds) in prison.  "He is very down. If Paul Touvier dies in prison, a man will have been allowed  to die who should not have been there."
Sources said the prosecution had opposed Touvier's appeal on the grounds  it was contrary to French criminal law.
