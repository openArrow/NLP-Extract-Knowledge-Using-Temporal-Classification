A senior White House aide was forced to resign  Thursday after it was discovered he had used a presidential helicopter to go  golfing.
David Watkins, White House director of administration, and others were  photographed boarding the presidential chopper after playing golf at the Holly  Hills Country Club near New Market, Maryland.
In an afternoon press conference to announce that China's most favored  nation trade status would be renewed, the president said he was very upset  about the appearance of impropriety and had asked his chief of staff to  investigate.
"Mr. Watkins offered his resignation and I insisted the taxpayers be  reimbursed," he said. "Taxpayers will be made whole."
The president said no decision had been made on the fate of those who  accompanied Watkins on the golf outing. White House aides said privately that  one of those was Al Maldon, director of the White House military office.
Clinton initially said that Watkins had been scouting facilities for a  presidential visit, but White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers declined to back  that explanation.
