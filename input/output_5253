The ruling Liberal Party's Ernesto Samper was  leading his closest opponent by a razor-thin margin Sunday, according to early  returns in Colombia's presidential vote.
With 56.3 percent of all votes counted nationwide, Samper, with 45.4  percent, was leading Conservative Andres Pastrana, with 44.6 percent, by a 0.9  percent margin, the electoral board said.
Former M-19 rebel leader Antonio Navarro was trailing in third place with  4.1 percent of the vote, the board reported.
A Radio Caracol exit poll indicated Samper would win the vote, with 47.3  percent of all ballots.
But that would not be enough to clinch Sunday's race for him.
If no candidate draws more than 50 percent of all votes, the election for  the first time will move into a run-off, which would be held June 19.
