Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic gave late  Sunday his unconditional acceptance to resuming peace talks on ending the  Bosnian war, the Serb SRNA agency said.
The pledge to agree to fresh negotiations "without conditions" came in  answer to a call late Saturday from Yasushi Akashi, the United Nations special  representative in ex-Yugoslavia.
In letters to Karadzic and Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, Akashi  proposed disarming the warring parties and deploying a UN force to separate  them.
Karadzic, who said he had yet to receive Akashi's letter, added that he  favoured "a definitive peace accord over a temporary one".
Karadzic said he had no knowledge of Akashi's latest proposal.
He urged the international community "to commit the (Bosnian) Moslem side  to ending its offensive", warning that, if this failed to happen "the Serbs  are within their rights to defend themselves and launch a counter-offensive,"  the agency said.
Earlier Sunday in Sarajevo Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic said he  would lead a government delegation to Geneva Monday for talks with the  international contact group on the war.
Speaking Sunday on Bosnian television, he said: "We are completely in  favour of a peaceful solution, but if we are forced to defend ourselves  against aggression, we will defend ourselves."
The contact group comprises representatives of the European Union, Russia,  the United States and the United Nations.
It has proposed a four-month ceasefire to allow for the resumption of  peace talks.
