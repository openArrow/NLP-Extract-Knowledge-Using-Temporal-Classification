The French government is to make a gift of 25  million francs (4.47 million dollars) to help rebuild the Bosnian capital of  Sarajevo, the French economy ministry announced here Monday.
The money will be targetted at the restoration of the electricity network  around the war-shattered city. The work will be carried out by the French  power group EDF.
Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery said providing the money "demonstrates  France's will to help the return of normal life in Sarajevo and the concern  France has to be among the first to respond to the needs" of the Bosnian  capital.
France's role in the two-year Bosnian conflict has dominated political  debate here since a group of French intellectuals said they planned to enter a  "Sarajevo list" of candidates for European Union elections on June 12 in order  to highlight the fighting.
The list was withdrawn Monday though its organisers said they would  continue campaigning, particularly for a lifting of the arms embargo on former  Yugoslavia which they see as preventing the Bosnian authorities from defending  their republic.
