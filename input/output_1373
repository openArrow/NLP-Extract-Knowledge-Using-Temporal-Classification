FIFA president Joao Havelange said  here Tuesday the 1998 World Cup in France would have 32 finalists - eight more  than at present.
"From 1998 we shall have a world championship with 32 teams," the  International Football Federation chief said when presenting the World Cup  history to the International Olympic Committee museum.
FIFA secretary Sepp Blatter added: "It's a formality. The decision has to  be taken by the executive committee but there is no doubt about it. The  allocation of finalists will be decided on the results of the 1994 World Cup  in the United States."
The French World Cup organising committee had asked for a decision as soon  as possible.
Havelange, first elected FIFA boss in 1974, increased the number of  finalists from 16 to 24 in 1982 when the tournament was held in Spain.
It was widely thought on both occasions he increased the number of  finalists to ward off opposition. No rivals have stepped forward to challenge  the 76-year-old when he stands for re-election at the FIFA congress in Chicago  in June.
