The index of American consumer confidence in the  US economy slipped to 87.6 percent in May from a revised 92.1 percent the  previous month, the Conference Board said Tuesday.
The Conference Board, a private business research institute, had initially  estimated the April level on its monthly index at 91.7 percent.
The decline in May was sharper than expected. Most analysts had forecast a  dip to 90.5 percent.
The Conference Board stressed that Americans seem significantly less  optimistic about current economic conditions and slightly less confident about  the direction the economy will take in the next six months.
Despite May's downturn, index levels in the past few months have been  close to a four-year high, said Fabian Linden, a Board consumer researcher.
The index, calculated on a 1985 base of 100, is compiled from a monthly  survey sent to 5,000 households.
