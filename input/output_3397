The UN Security Council expressed concern  Monday about continued fighting in Liberia and warned that it could interfere  with the elections in September.
The council urged the parties to resolve their differences through the  transition government recently installed as part of the Cotonou peace  agreement signed last July.
Council members also said that fighting among the parties had all but  stopped the disarmament process which they said was vital to the September  elections.
"Political differences and renewed violence among and within certain  factions have caused the disarmament process to come to a virtual halt," said  a statement read by Nigeria's Ibrahim Gambari, who holds the council's  rotating presidency.
The council said it would review the situation in Liberia again on or  before June 30 to decide whether sufficient progress had been made in carrying  out the
peace agreement.
