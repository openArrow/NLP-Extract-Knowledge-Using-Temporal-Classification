Chinese President Jiang Zemin Thursday defended  the 1989 military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square,  saying China's stability and prosperity had depended on it, Xinhua reported.
Jiang made the comments in a meeting with visiting Malaysian Prime  Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the official news agency said in a report monitored  here.
"A bad thing has been turned into a good thing and as a result our reform  and opening program has forged ahead with steadier, better and even quicker  steps and our advantages have been brought into fuller play," Xinhua quoted  him as saying.
"History shows that anything conducive to our national stability is good,"  Jiang said.
"The stability of China is not only needed for China's own development,  but will also benefit the stability of Asia and the world in general," he  added.
Mahathir said he had been encouraging Malaysian businessmen to invest in  China and that his government was satisfied with the steady growth of economic  and trade ties with China, the report said.
Referring to his meeting in Washington with US President Bill Clinton  shortly before his arrival in China, Mahathir said he had stressed that one  country should not try to impose its views on another, Xinhua said.
He added that he had expressed his opposition to Washington's using  renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status as a way to pressure  Beijing.
Clinton is due to make a decision by June 3 on renewing MFN status for  China.
Earlier Mahathir met Chinese Premier Li Peng, with both sides approving of  developing bilateral ties.
They also agreed on using dialogue to settle the Spratly islands issue.
The tiny islands in the South China Sea are believed to have important oil  deposits under them and are also claimed in whole or in part Vietnam, Brunei,  the Philippines and Taiwan.
Mahathir is in Beijing to attend a high-profile international seminar on  China's economic future, which ended Friday.
