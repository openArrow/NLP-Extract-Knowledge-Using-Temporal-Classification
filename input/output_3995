English football's infamous hardman Vinnie Jones  played the court jester for an afternoon on Wednesday.
Wearing a multi-coloured striped shirt over a white T-shirt, blue jeans  and with an ear stud, the Wimbledon midfield player cut an incongruous figure  in the High Court, where he had been summoned to give evidence in a case  involving his former team mate, Paul Elliott.
Replying to a question by Colin MacKay QC, for Liverpool Football Club,  about a tackle made by the Anfield club's former player Dean Saunders that  resulted in the end of Elliott's career, Jones reduced the court to laughter  when he said: "I've seen people try and tackle and miss the ball.
"I've done it myself, once or twice."
Elliott, 30, who had a spell with Italian club Pisa, is suing Welsh  international Saunders, 29, claiming the striker was reckless and with the  tackle, which ruptured his knee ligaments.
Jones, who as a Chelsea player had been the nearest to the incident at  Anfield in September 1992, made a 20-minute appearance in the witness-box  after he was subpoenaed by Elliott's side.
A reluctant Jones told the judge, Mr Justice Drake: "I'd like to point out  that I am here by subpoena and I didn't want to come for reasons of my own."
On being told at the end of his questioning that he was free to leave,  Jones said: "Thank God for that."
As he left, the Press benches emptied and the judge quipped: "Mr Jones  attracted a lot of the gate money."
Earlier Chelsea chairman Ken Bates had told the hearing his players had  wanted to "lynch" Saunders, now with Aston Villa, for the tackle.
Bates said: "At half-time, the Chelsea players were incensed that such a  thing could be done to a fellow professional."
The case continues.
