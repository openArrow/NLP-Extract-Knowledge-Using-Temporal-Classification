President Bill Clinton's approval rating has  dropped to its lowest level in nine months, according to a poll published  Sunday.
The survey conducted May 23-26 by the Harris Poll found that 42 percent  gave Clinton a positive rating against 48 percent in early April, while his  negative rating was up 56 percent from 51 percent two months ago.
It was the lowest approval rating Clinton has seen since August 1993, when  it dropped to 41 percent.
Some groups that reliably vote Democratic, those with lower incomes and  education, gave the president low ratings. Only 40 percent of those who earned  under 7,500 dollars annually gave him good marks, and just 41 percent with no  high school degrees approved.
The view that Clinton lacks foreign policy leadership could be pushing his  ratings down, according to Humphrey Taylor, president of Louis Harris and  Associates, who also noted Clinton's problems with the Whitewater real estate  deal and the sexual harassment charge recently made against him.
The president's lowest rating came in June last year, when it plunged to  35 percent.
The Harris survey of 1,253 adults had a margin of error of plus or minus  three percent.
