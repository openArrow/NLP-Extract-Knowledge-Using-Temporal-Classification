Haitian strongman Lt. General Raoul Cedras,  head of the ruling military junta, warned that any US invasion of Haiti would  be met with fierce resistance by all the people of the nation.
Cedras said that the whole country would rise up if President Clinton  ordered US troops to invade.
An invasion "will be the most terrible mistake of the United States of  America" said Cedras during a taped interview with CNN's "Evans and Novak",  broadcast Saturday.
Earlier this week US forces carried out a mock air, land and sea invasion  involving 44,000 soldiers this week which the Boston Globe claimed was  developed with Haiti in mind.
White House and Pentagon officials denied it was a rehearsal for military  intervention in Haiti.
The Globe said the exercise used North Carolina and Puerto Rico as landing  sites for the mock invasion involving amphibious landing vessels, a submarine  and more than 200 sorties by Marine jet fighers.
A spokesman for the US Atlantic Command said the exercises had as a target  a fictitious country run by an "unfriendly leader" who had suddenly seized  power.
Last week President Bill Clinton refused to rule out a military  intervention to restore democracy in Haiti.
Cedras also warned that international action to toughen sanctions  threatens to tear his nation apart.
"They may provoke an explosion in this society," he warned.
Earlier this month the UN Security Council gave the Haitian military  leaders until May 21 to step down or face a full commercial embargo.
Cedras spoke with CNN Tuesday, the day before military-backed interim  president Emile Jonassaint took office. The installation was seen as an act of  defiance by Haiti against the international pressure.
