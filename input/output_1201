The United Nations food aid agency said Tuesday it  would give drought-hit Kenya additional food aid worth an estimated 2.4  million dollars this year.
The World Food Programme (WFP) said food shortages and economic hardship  in the east African country were likely to worsen before September.
"The already tight food supply situation in many regions of the country is  likely to become even tighter as prices of basic food commodities rise beyond  the reach of the poor in rural and urban areas," WFP's Kenya director Michael  Sackett said.
Food prices rocketed after Kenya lifted price controls on most staples  last year under an economic liberalization programme sponsored by the World  Bank and the International Monetary Fund, accused by President Daniel arap Moi  of pushing Kenya into social turmoil by imposing harsh lending conditions.
Moi said his ruling Kenya African National Union party would soon meet to  discuss how to cope with rising food prices, triggering fears that Kenya could  be starting to soft-pedal its economic liberalization programme, now entering  its final phase.
Two years of poor rains have severely dented food production.
The 56,000 tonnes of maize, beans and vegetable oil provided by WFP will  go to Kenya's poor, including thousands of people displaced by ethnic clashes  in the past two years which have also disrupted agriculture in some areas.
The opposition and several Western-based human rights groups have accused  Moi's government of instigating the violence.
