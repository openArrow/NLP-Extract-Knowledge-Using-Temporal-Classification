Construction of new homes and apartments in the  United States fell 2.5 percent in April, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.
Housing starts rose 12.3 percent in March.
Analysts had expected the April slide because of rising mortgage rates.
The department said housing starts totaled 1.46 million at a seasonally  adjusted rate, down from a revised 1.49 million in March. The department's  initial estimate was 1.47 million.
The strong March advance was partly due to a rebound in construction  following a 21.2 percent plunge in February blamed on unusually harsh winter  weather.
In December, housing starts rose 14.7 percent to 1.61 million units.
Many analysts say that rising interest rates will probably slow consumer  spending and home sales.
Interest rates on fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages averaged 8.39 percent in  April, up from 7.75 percent in March and 6.74 percent in October, their lowest  level in 25 years, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
The National Association of Home Builders said Monday it had revised to  1.38 million units its forecast for housing starts in 1994, down from 1.43  million units predicted in the beginning of the year.
