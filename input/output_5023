UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said  Saturday that President Bill Clinton's new peacekeeping plan was in tune with  his own ideas for the United Nations.
Boutros-Ghali, in a speech to graduating students at Georgetown  University, described Clinton's May 5 directive as "balanced, responsible and  constructive" and "compatible" with the ideas he set down in his 1992 report  on UN peace operations, "An Agenda for Peace."
The presidential directive called for reducing the US share of UN peace  operation costs from 30.4 percent to 25 percent; caution in involvement;  definition of national interest; and keeping US forces under US command.
"UN operations can be the cheapest and most effective means of maintaining  peace, but this is difficult to demonstrate in the absence of a reliable flow  of funds," the Egyptian statesman said.
According to UN officials, the United States currently is in arrears to  the world body 1.2 billion dollars, including 850 million for the current  fiscal year and 330 million dollars for previous years.
Boutros-Ghali was awarded an honorary doctorate from the university's  School of Foreign Service, of which Clinton is an alumnus.
