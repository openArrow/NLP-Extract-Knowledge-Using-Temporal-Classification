The US brokerage firms Merryl Lynch and J.P. Morgan  and the French banks Parisbas and Indosuez have struck a deal with the  Lebanese government to sell treasury bonds, central bank governor Riad Salame  said Tuesday.
Salame told AFP that the four firms would lend the government 300 million  dollars and sell the Lebanese treasury bonds on the European secondary  markets. He did not say when the transactions would start.
The move will be the first of its kind in Lebanon, where parliament last  year approved a bill to issue treasury bonds to finance post-war  reconstruction projects.
MPs backed a request by the government of billionaire Prime Minister Rafic  Hariri to finance the construction of a ring-road in Beirut and develop the  poor suburbs through the sale of treasury bonds.
"The government did not set a date to issue the bonds and did not want to  launch the operation immediately because the differential rate that was  proposed to us was high," Salame said.
But he said the rate sharply decreased following the success of Solidere,  a group of private investors and property holders who secured 650 million  dollars earlier this year from the sale of public shares to rebuild the  war-devastated city center of Beirut.
Infrastructure work in the center is set to begin in August, according to  Salame.
The governor of the central bank, which intervenes between the government  and foreign firms, added that the authorities decided to delay the issue of  treasury bonds to wait for market stability in Europe.
