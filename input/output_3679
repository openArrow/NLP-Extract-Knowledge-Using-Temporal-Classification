The head of a state-owned distribution company was  found murdered Tuesday in suburban Algiers, security services said.
Abdennour Naceri was found shot in his car near the headquarters of the  firm, Districh, which distributed shoes and leather goods, the services said.
There was no word on a motive for the attack or a claim of responsibility.
Earlier Tuesday a newspaper said a kidnapped attorney was found dead over  the weekend.
Belghoul Saadi, 42, was found with his throat cut Saturday, the daily  L'Opinion said.
Saadi was taken from his home in an area where Islamic fundamentalists  enjoy strong support. The zone is known as the "triangle of fear."
The daily did not say who carried out the killing but noted that Saadi was  a defender of Islamic fundamentalists in Algerian courts. He was the fourth    lawyer to be killed in recent months.
