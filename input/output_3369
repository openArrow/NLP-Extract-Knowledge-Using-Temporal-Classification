Diego Maradona's role in his fourth World Cup will  be as the conductor of the orchestra.
At 33, Argentina's captain is no longer capable of playing all the  instruments the way he did in 1986, when he virtually won the tournament on  his own.
Since a 15-month ban for cocaine abuse ended in 1992, the footballing  genius who emerged from the slums of Buenos Aires to become a national hero  has struggled to find the motivation to make the daily effort demanded by club  football.
He officially retired after being sacked by Sevilla last season and his  spell with Newell's Old Boys lasted a derisory five months and seven games.
When reporters turned up at his country villa earlier this year hoping to  quiz him on the possibility of a return to his former club Boca Juniors, he  reacted by spraying them with water and airgun pellets.
By then it was obvious the only thing keeping Maradona going was the  prospect of leading his country in the United States.
The shooting was the latest in a long-line of problems that have marred  his career. But there will still be millions of football fans across the world  ready to forgive Maradona all his sins in return for the joy he has brought  them.
The goal he scored in the 1986 quarter final, when he carved his way  through the heart of England's defence, was probably -- because of the speed  at which his breathtaking dribble was executed -- the best individual goal  ever seen in such an important match.
It was also one that brilliantly captured the genius of Maradona --  perfect balance, devastating acceleration and a left foot capable of keeping  virtually any ball under control in any circumstances.
The acceleration has gone but the control and the ability to weight a pass  to the nearest millimetre are still there. He might not go out with a bang but  Maradona has it within him in to make a dignified exit from the limelight he  has hogged, for one reason or another, for more than a decade.
