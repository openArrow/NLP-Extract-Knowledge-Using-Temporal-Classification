President Cesar Gaviria called Wednesday a  referendum aimed at reversing the legalization of the consumption and  possession of drugs for personal use.
The controversial legalization law took effect Tuesday following a May 5  ruling by the Constitutional Court.
The court decision drew an angry response from Gaviria's government, which  is in a virtual state of war with powerful cocaine cartels based in Cali and  Medellin.
Gaviria said he would consult with political party leaders, Roman Catholic  church representatives and unions in a committee that will organize and set  the date for the vote.
Colombia's government rarely calls such a vote, but it was virtually  Gaviria's only option as the court ruling itself cannot be appealed, observers  said.
The referendum would lead to a consitutional amendment revoking the  legalization ruling.
Gaviria also said he would soon issue a decree regulating drug use that  had been legalized.
The high court ruled five to four that the state was playing God by  banning personal use of drugs and that the ban violated the constitution.
"The state was being lord and master of the lives of everyone. ... In a  free society everyone must be responsible for his own acts," the court's  ruling said.
It allows individuals to possess up to 20 grams of marijuana, five grams  of hashish, one gram of cocaine, and two grams of substances similar to LSD.
Under the old law, anyone caught with even those quantities of the drugs  listed could have been held under arrest for as many as 30 days and fined the  equivalent of 60 dollars.
