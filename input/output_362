Canada's Paul Tracy, a pole favorite  for the Indianapolis 500, suffered a crash here Friday during a practice lap  and was hospitalized.
Tracy was taken to Methodist Hospital here complaining of pain in his left  foot, but was awake and alert.
Doctor Henry Bock, medical director at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway,  said Tracy lost consciousness briefly during the crash. Tracy will undergo  neurological tests and an X-ray examination at the hospital.
Tracy drives a Mercedes-powered Penske car, one of three that have the  best times during practice for the May 29 Indy race. The Penske motor takes  advantae of a rule loophole allowing extra boost over convention Indy engine  designs.
The crash caused extensive damage to the car, leaving little chance it  will be ready for Saturday's start of time trials. Tracy's backup car has not  taken a lap at Indianapolis Motor Speedway's 2.5-mile (4km) oval.
Tracy's car went out of control and skidded through the third turn into  the infield grass. The car then spun across the track and into the fourth-turn  outer wall, hitting on the left front side and coming to a stop on the edge of  the track.
Tracy was on a fast lap after building speed on a warm-up effort. He had  reached a top speed of 228.693 mph (365.908 km/h) and was clocked at 240 mph  (384 km/h) a few minutes earlier on the same area of track where the crash  began.
