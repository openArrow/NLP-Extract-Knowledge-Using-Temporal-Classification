Italy's European policy will not be affected by the  "radical political change" in the country, whose government includes  neo-fascist ministers, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino said Saturday.
In an interview with the daily Corriere della Sera, Martino said the  change since right-wing media magnate Silvio Berlusconi took over as prime  minister following March elections "does not mean a break with the fundamental  line of our foreign policy."
"It is essential that we make it understood straight away that we do not  have any intention of giving up Italy's European vocation."
He said he would meet Sunday in Brussels with Italy's ambassadors posted  to the 12 European Union countries, ahead of an EU foreign ministers meeting  scheduled for Monday.
Martino is also due to hold talks in Brussels on Monday with European  Commission President Jacques Delors.
The Italian foreign minister intends to fly to Washington afterwards to  meet US leaders for talks focusing on preparations for the July 8 Group of  Seven summit of the world's leading industrialised nations in Naples.
Pressed on Italy's European policy, the minister said it would be based on  "an active policy in support of a political Europe, which is absolutely  necessary."
"Europe must find a way of speaking with a single voice on foreign policy  and must reach a common defence," he said.
Martino, who is close to Berlusconi, renewed criticism of the fixing of  exchange rates during the move towards a single European currency by a target  date of 1999.
"I am not anti-European when I criticise an excess of intervention on  markets. I would also like to recall that an excess of directives (from the  EU) make Europe appear in the eyes of public opinion as another level of  regulation which is superimposed on that of the nation.
"And that leads to a reaction of rejection," he said.
