There is a huge potential in countertrade  financing in Asia-Pacific as countries rush to trade with emerging Indochinese  markets and China, according to Dutch bank MeesPierson.
"All countries are focussing on the emerging markets because that is where  the profits are to be made," the bank's Singapore branch general manager  Maarten van Alkemade told reporters in an interview Wednesday.
Van Alkemade said the Indochinese countries accounted for half of the  counter-trade business, and China the remaining half.
He said at least 50 percent of MeesPierson's clients in Singapore were  involved in countertrade or in commodity-related projects.
Countertrade financing, however, accounted for only 10 percent of the  business of the Singapore branch which started business here a year ago.
The bank estimated the market for this specialised financing is worth  between 60 million-to-90 million US dollars, or equal to that for  straight-forward trade and commodity financing, Van Alkemade said.
"We would like to increase countertrade financing from 10 percent of our  business to half," he said, adding: "We should have been here four or five  years ago but we are trying to catch up."
Countertrade is a mechanism for the exchange of goods and services without  monetary payment used by countries lacking hard currencies to pay for imports.
