Pakistani President Farooq Ahmed Leghari may  meet with Secretary of State Warren Christopher on a private visit here next  week, as the United States tries to urge Pakistan to cap its nuclear weapons  program.
The Pakistani president's US visit is "strictly private," and is  essentially to attend his son Awais' graduation from the University of  Rochester, New York, at the weekend, a Pakistani embassy spokesman said  Tuesday.
But Leghari is expected to meet with US officials during his stay in  Washington May 23 to 25 and may see Christopher, the spokesman said.
Washington is trying to persuade both India and Pakistan to put a cap on  their nuclear weapons programs in the interests of non-proliferation.
In return, the US side would allow delivery of 38 F-16 fighters for which  Pakistan already has paid 650 million dollars.
The planes were ordered under a 1989 deal frozen in 1990 because then  President George Bush refused to certify to Congress that Islamabad's nuclear  program was not for military purposes.
Leghari will be in Washington a week after Indian Prime Minister P.V.  Narasimha Rao, who is to meet President Bill Clinton on Thursday during the  first official US visit by an Indian premier in seven years.
While in Washington the Pakistani president will give a lecture next  Tuesday at the Council on Foreign Relations and will meet with officials of  the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, Pakistani officials here said.
Leghari will spend Memorial Day weekend in San Francisco with his family  and return home June 2.
