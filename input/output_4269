Bulgaria's Prime Minister Luben Berov called  Thursday on parliament for a vote of confidence in his non-party interim  government, in the run-up to early general elections, parliamentary officials  said.
If parliament rejects the vote of confidence in his administration, made  up of experts, other parliamentary groups will then be charged with trying to  form a government.
President Zhelio Zhelev, parliamentary president Alexander Yordanov and  all parties here are agreed on the need to hold general elections ahead of the  normal parliamentary term which ends in 1995. Early elections could be held in  October or November.
The current government intends to carry on with land reform and  privatisation, maintain price controls and attempt to finalize an agreement  with the London Club on reducing by half Bulgaria's 8.7 billion dollar debt,  Berov said.
On Friday, parliament rejected by 116 votes to 108 a cabinet reshuffle  proposed by Berov.
