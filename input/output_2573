Haiti braced for tough UN-ordered  international sanctions amid complaints that the near-total trade embargo  would hurt the poorest residents of the hemisphere's most impoverished county.
Some Haitians interviewed a day before the sanctions were to take effect  predicted that wealthy residents and military leaders would get by for months  with supplies stockpiled over the last few month, including fuel smuggled from  the neighboring Dominican Republic.
One business leader said the country's oil reserves had been recently  replenished with fuel smuggled in from abroad.
"People like us are going to suffer the most and die of hunger while the  privileged will survive because they have money to eat," said one unemployed  Haitian.
Other Haitians expressed fears they would be unable to buy kerosene for  oil lamps, often the only source of light in some shantytowns.
The trade embargo was to take effect after midnight Saturday, (0400 GMT  Sunday), unless Haiti's military rulers resign and allow the restoration of  democracy in Haiti.
The embargo, which excludes food and medical products, would be as tough  as those in effect against Iraq and the former Yugoslavia.
UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali told the Security Council early  Friday there was no sign the military would comply with UN demands.
"I regret to inform the Council that there has been no change in the  attitude of the Haitian military." Boutros-Ghali said in a statement.
The May 6 resolution set a 15-day deadline in hopes of breaking the  deadlock on the political crisis caused by the military ouster of elected  president Jean-Bertrand Aristide in September 1991.
