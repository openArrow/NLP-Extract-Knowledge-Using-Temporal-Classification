Bakili Muluzi was sworn in Saturday afternoon as  Malawi's first democratically elected president at a colourful ceremony  attended by about 80,000 people in Kamuzu Stadium here.
Muluzi and his deputy, Justin Malewezi, were sworn in by Chief Justice,  Richard Banda.
Muluzi, a Moslem by religion, swore by the Koran in front of tens of  thousands of people, mainly supporters of his ruling Malawi Democratic Party  (UDF).
In his acceptance speech, President Muluzi said he had ordered Malawi's  notorious prisons and detentions camps like Mikuyu, Dzeleka and Nsanje closed  immediately.
"These are prisons which were closely associated with the Malawi Congress  Party's government abuse of human rights," he said, referring to the former  ruling party headed by his predecessor Hastings Kamuzu Banda.
