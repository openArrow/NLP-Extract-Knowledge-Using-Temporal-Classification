Prize-winning author Alexander  Solzhenitsyn came face to face with the reality of Russian life on Saturday  when he got stuck in a hospital lift for more than 20 minutes.
The Nobel literature laureate returned to Russia on Friday from 20 years  of exile, mainly spent in his Vermont hideaway in the United States.
Solzhenitsyn was not fazed by the lift breakdown, according to an AFP  photographer present.
He used the time to question the hospital's director about working  conditions, jotting down her replies in a little notebook.
