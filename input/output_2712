Albania's last communist president, Ramiz Alia, and  nine of his top aides went on trial Saturday for ordering summary executions  and taking money from the public coffers.
The charges of criminal abuse of office also cover the shooting of fleeing  refugees at the border and deportations.
Alia, 67, told the court his trial should be broadcast live on Albanian  radio and television.
"I was a state leader for 10 years and the people must know what I am  being asked and what I think," Alia said.
But the presiding judge said the press was "free to write about this trial  what it wants."
The court will hear 137 witnesses.
"I have no address, and you can put down whatever you want as my  profession," Alia told the court at the start of Saturday's hearing.
The trial of Alia, who was chief ideologist to long-time Albanian  communist ruler Enver Hoxha and served as president until 1992 after Hoxha's  death in 1985, has raised little interest in Tirana, and security at the court  was light.
The other defendents in the trial include former prime minister Adil  Carcani, former interior ministers Simon Stefani and Hekuran Isai and  communist party officials Manush Muftiu and Rita Marko.
