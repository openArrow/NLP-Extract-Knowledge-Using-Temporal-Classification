A man believed to be mentally deranged passed by  tight security at Manila airport before dawn Wednesday and clambered on top of  a parked passenger jet, Philippine aviation officials said.
Airport police gave chase after they spotted Nestor Escaran, 20, on the  ramp area of the domestic airport. The man then ran up the rear stairway of a  parked Philippine Airlines airbus and managed to climb atop the plane, they  said.
He was finally convinced to climb down after five minutes, and is now  under police custody. Airport officials said no flights were disrupted as a  result of the stunt.
