The Belgian government won "verbal guarantees"  from the Cuban authorities Monday that 114 asylum-seeking Cubans who broke  into the Belgian ambassador's residency in Havana will not be prosecuted,  foreign ministry sources told AFP.
"We have obtained verbal guarantees that the refugees will not be pursued  if they leave the amassador's residence," a ministry spokesman said. The  ministry was still seeking written guarantees, he added.
The 114 Cubans broke into the Belgian ambassador's residency on Saturday  requesting political asylum in Belgium.
Brussels said it had also asked the Cubans to provide enough food and  water for the asylum-seekers. The residency normally houses three or four  officials in addition to the ambassador.
On Sunday, Cuba's state-run television blamed Florida-based anti-Castro  radio stations and the US government for the occupation of the building.
