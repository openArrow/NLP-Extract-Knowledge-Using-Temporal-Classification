Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said in Tokyo earlier Tuesday that  "I am expecting that the US side will also state that it would not seek  numerical targets."
Japanese news agencies reported late Monday that the United States and  Japan had reached "a broad accord" to resume the negotiations in the near  future.
The agreement would not include reference to numerical targets, the  Japanese reports said.
Kakizawa also stressed that any agreement would be only on the terms of  resuming the negotiations.
US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor on Monday described as inaccurate a  Wall Street Journal report that the US side was easing its position and was  prepared to abandon its insistence on numerical targets.
"We have not backed off," Kantor told reporters. "We have never asked for  market share."
Reports from Tokyo before the talks began suggested the Japanese team  could bring proposals for at least partial acceptance of numerical targets in  the government procurement sector.
The government procurement talks cover computers, supercomputers,  satellites, medical technology and telecommunications.
