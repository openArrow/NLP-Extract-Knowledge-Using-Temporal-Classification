British sport has reported a fall in positive drug  tests over the last year.
Tests by the Sports Council unearthed 41 positives, seven fewer than in  the previous 12 months.
Peter Radford, chairman of the council's Drug Abuse Advisory Group, said  the results were encouraging but warned that anabolic steroids still accounted  for nearly half the positives.
There were nearly 4,000 tests taken in 49 sports, a quarter of which were  either out of competition or done at short notice.
