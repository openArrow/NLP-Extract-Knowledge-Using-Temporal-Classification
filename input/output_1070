The Roman Catholic bishop mediating between  Mexico's federal government and ethnic-Maya rebels met with Vatican officials  Monday for what the cleric described as very satisfying talks.
Monsignor Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas in Chiapas  state, said he had come to Rome on his own initiative.
He said he wanted to inform the Holy See "directly and personally" of the  latest developments in the standoff in Chiapas, Mexico's poorest state,  between the Zapatista National Liberation Army and government forces.
The dispute involved "a group of Catholic and evangelical Indians who have  decided, unfortunately while bearing arms, to cry out against the same things  that other Indians continue to cry out against patiently and peacefully," he  said.
Ruiz added that talks between the two sides were in progress and that he  was certain an agreement would be reached. He met cardinals Angelo Sodano,  Roger Etchegaray and Joseph Ratzinger during his visit.
He was unable to meet the pope, who has been in hospital since breaking  his femur two weeks ago.
The EZLN rose up against the Mexican government January 1 to demand better  attention to heavily indigenous Chiapas state's economic, health care and  social problems, and to demand meaningful national democratic reform.
