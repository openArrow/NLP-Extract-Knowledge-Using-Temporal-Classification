A shoot-out between Israeli  troops and Palestinian gunmen left four Gazans wounded on Sunday, Palestinian  sources said, as their new police force carried out its first investigation.
The army said two Palestinians aboard a truck from which the attack came  were lightly wounded.
Doctors at Khan Yunes hospital reported that four people who needed  treatment for bullet wounds said they had been in a taxi when the shooting  started.
The attack took place near the settlement of Morag where the Islamic  Resistance Movement HAMAS claimed responsibility for seriously wounding an  Israeli truck driver last Thursday.
The Palestinian police investigation was their first since Israeli troops  started last Wednesday to withdraw from most of the Gaza Strip, to be replaced  by the new police force.
Two policemen questioned the wounded in hospital and drew up a report  which was submitted to the joint Israeli-Palestinian military liaison  committee, an officer told AFP.
Under the May 4 deal to launch autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, all armed  incidents are to be reported to the committee.
In Amman, HAMAS spokesman Ibrahim Ghoshe said Sunday that the job of the  police was to protect their fellow Palestinians from attack by Israeli  soldiers and Jewish settlers, not to block anti-Israeli operations.
HAMAS does not rule out attacks in the newly-autonomous areas, he told  AFP. "The place and level of operations is decided by the military leadership  of HAMAS which is in the occupied territories."
Ghoshe said he hoped the police "will not block the national duty of HAMAS  in its struggle against the Zionist occupier."
