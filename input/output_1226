More than one in seven Japanese expatriate families  in Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia have fallen victim to street  crimes, and over a third have hired security guards for their homes, a survey  said Tuesday.
The survey, conducted by the Japan Overseas Enterprises Association in  Tokyo, reflects difficulties and dangers that Japanese have faced in  politically unstable regions, in a stark contrast to their own nation, where  safety on the street is expected.
The association surveyed 908 Japanese businessmen and their families  working at 194 overseas offices between December 1993 to January this year.
In response to feeling threatened in their homes, 34.6 percent of those  questioned said they had hired private security guards.
Of the respondents, 15.4 percent ssaid they had been victims of various  street crimes, burglaries or pickpockets, while 24.8 percent have run into  traffic accidents.
Another 14.8 percent said they had experienced extortion by police and  customs officials, and 10.9 percent reported their car or its parts had been  stolen.
