Despite a secure margin, Fittipaldi was trying to stretch his lead because  of uncertain fuel mileage. He and Unser both would have had to pit with four  laps remaining for more fuel.
"You can't really question his strategy," car owner Roger Penske said. "He  wanted to make sure he had Al at the finish."
Fittipaldi lammented his bad luck in past years here. He led in 1991  before a gearbox failure forced him out 29 laps from the finish and fell  victim to blistering tires in 1990 after starting from the pole position.
His Indy triumphs came in 1989, when he and Unser bumped on the  next-to-last lap, and last year, when he overcame Nigel Mansell on a restart  after a caution period.
"It seems my wins here have to come when I'm struggling," Fittipaldi said.
