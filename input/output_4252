A special rapporteur, appointed by the UN Human  Rights Commission to investigate ethnic blood-letting in Rwanda, Thursday  expressed anxiety ahead of his mission.
Rene Degni-Segui, a 46-year-old law professor and chairman of the Ivory  Coast Human Rights League, told AFP he had accepted the mission "with the  risks involved," adding: "I mostly fear the difficulties awaiting me in view  of the situation which is still very volatile."
Degni-Segui, who had not been officially informed of his appointment, was  not able to say when his mission might begin.
UN Human Rights Commissioner Jose Ayala Lasso expressed concern Wednesday  that the Rwandan government and rebels might not even let the envoy into the  country.
Under a resolution passed Wednesday at the UN in Geneva after a two-day  emergency session on Rwanda, Degni-Segui was assigned to travel to the tiny  central African country and investigate the "root causes and responsibilities"  for the massacres there, which have left up to 500,000 people dead by some  estimates since April 6.
He is to report back within a month with recommendations on how to end the  violence.
He was also asked to gather information on offenses that might be  considered crimes against humanity.
Ayala Lasso, who recently visited Rwanda, told a press conference that  both the government and rebels had requested "the presence of the UN to  investigate, establish responsibilities and to punish, and both sides pledged  cooperation."
In March 1992, Degni-Segui was arrested and sentenced to two years  imprisonment for joint responsability in connection with acts of vandalism  committed four months earlier following an opposition demonstration in Abidjan.
He was released in July of the same year under a general amnesty.
