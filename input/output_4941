UN envoy Yasushi Akashi has invited the warring  parties in Bosnia-Hercegovina to negotiate a comprehensive cessation of  hostilities at a meeting in Geneva Thursday and Friday, the UN Protection  Force announced Saturday.
The co-chairmen of the peace conference in the former Yugoslavia, Lord  Owen of the European Union and Thorvald Stoltenberg of the United Nations, as  well as US special envoy Charles Redman and his Russian counterpart Vitaly  Churkin were also invited, a UNPROFOR statement said.
Akashi will be accompanied at the Geneva meeting by UNPROFOR Commander  Lieutenant General Bertrand de Lapresle, and the UNPROFOR Commander in  Bosnia-Hercegovina, Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, the statement added.
The announcement comes after France hosted two-day talks between the  so-called contact group on Bosnia-Hercegovina -- the European Union, Russia  and the United States -- and Bosnian Croats, Moslems and Serbs Wednesday and  Thursday in the Alpine hideaway of Talloires, not far from Geneva.
The session reached no apparent agreement, but another round was scheduled  in the French resort town on June 6 and 7.
The contact group negotiators tried in vain to get the factions to agree  to a four-month ceasefire and to accept a European plan for partition that  would give 51 percent of territory to the Croat-Moslem federation and 49  percent to the Serbs.
