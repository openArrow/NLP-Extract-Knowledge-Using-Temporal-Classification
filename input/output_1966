Deutsche Bank, leading creditor of  property developer Juergen Schneider, will have to make 400-500 million marks  (2.4-3.0 million dollars) provision for losses due to the Schneider group  collapse, bank board member Georg Krupp said.
Krupp, who is the board member for mortgage lending, said on ARD  television that the figure was not yet final, because examination of eight  developments Schneider financed through Deutsche Bank was not yet complete.
Deutsche Bank, which is Germany's biggest bank, is owed 1.2 billion marks  by the Schneider group.
But the president of the bank, Hilmar Kopper, told a shareholders' meeting  Thurday that despite the effects of the massive property scandal, bank  provisions against bad loans would be less this year than in 1993, when they  were 3.286 billion marks.
Kopper said that Deutsche Bank's operating profit after loss provisions  for the first four months of 1994 fell 10 percent compared with the same  period last year, to about 1.57 billion marks.
But he said that despite lower loss provisions, the bank would find it  difficult to match its 1993 record operating profit of 5.266 billion marks.
Deutsche Bank's net profit in 1993 was also a record at 2.14 billion  marks, up 22.6 percent on the previous year.
