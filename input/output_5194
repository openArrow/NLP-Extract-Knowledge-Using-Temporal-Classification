The Moslem fundamentalist group  HAMAS said Sunday it would temporarily stop killing people suspected of  collaborating with Israel, but the Palestinian police said the pledge did not  go far enough.
HAMAS said it had decided "to halt, for the time being, the pursuit of  agents and their execution, in order to allow the Palestinian police to carry  out their duties in this area."
But it warned that "the role of agents is turning more and more dangerous  for the mujahedeen (Islamic fighters), who consider themselves in a constant  struggle against the (Israeli) occupation forces."
A Palestinian police official, declining to be named, told AFP that the  pledge was not enough.
"They have not handed over the culprits of Friday's executions and we are  going to launch a search for them ... not because it is HAMAS but because they  have broken the law and killed people living under our authority," he said.
The police earlier ordered HAMAS to hand over militants who killed two  Palestinians found hanging from electric pylons, in the first such murders  since self-rule was launched this month.
"We have officially asked HAMAS leaders to hand them over so we can try  them. It is as much in their interest as it is in ours that they do it," said  police chief Nasser Yussef.
He said it was unacceptable that HAMAS act as "prosecutor, lawyer, judge  and hangman."
Control for security on the autonomous Gaza Strip and the self-rule  enclave of Jericho has passed to the Palestinian police under the terms of the  Israel-PLO autonomy deal, an agreement which HAMAS opposes.
