The Senate should approve a 14-year-old treaty  to curb millions of landmines from being layed around world said President  Clinton Thursday.
Senate ratification would be "a matter of humanity, common sense and sound  military doctrine," Clinton said.
International representatives concluded the original agreement in Geneva  in the fall of 1980. The United States signed on in 1982. Since then the  treaty has languished, the subject of multiple US government reviews.
More than 100 million landmines lie unexploded in at least 62 countries,  human rights groups reported. They also said worldwide production may be  reaching 10 million anti-personnel landmines annually. The American Red Cross  reported landmines kill more than 200 civilians every week.
Landmines are a particular threat in Afghanistan, Angola, and Cambodia.
Clinton termed the treaty "a modest but significant humanitarian effort to  protect the victims of armed conflict from the effects of particular weapons."
He also said ratification would strengthen US efforts urging an  international moratorium on the export of anti-personnel landmines.
State Department and United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees  personnel will testify before the Senate Friday on the issue.
