Two computer software companies, Microsoft  Corporation and Creative Technology Limited, Monday announced a strategic  alliance to develop compatible audio and computer systems products for  personal computers.
"This relationship will benefit end users as well as third party  developers by providing a comprehensive audio solution based on established  methods," Creative said in a statement.
Under the partnership, Creative will license Microsoft's Windows Sound  System while Microsoft will license Creative's Sound Blaster technology.
"This is a win-win opportunity for both companies," said Sim Wong Hoo,  Creative's chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Creative, a locally incorporated company, develops and manufactures sound  and video multimedia products for personal computers.
The company, whose subsidiaries include Creative Labs Inc, E-mu Systems  Inc and ShareVision Technology Inc, trades its stocks on the NASDAQ National  Market.
Microsoft, a NASDAQ counter based in the United States, offers a wide  range of computer software products and services for business and personal use.
