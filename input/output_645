North Flight with Kouichi Tsunoda in the saddle led  a Japanese one-two finish with Towa Darling to win the 1,600-metre (one mile)  Yasuda Memorial race here Sunday.
The four-year-old bay filly got ahead in the final furlong and crossed the  finishing line in one minute 33.2 seconds, two lengths and a half ahead of  Towa Darling.
French colt Dolphin Street, ridden by American Cash Asmussen, came third  followed by Japan's Sakura Bakushin O fourth on the rainy Tokyo Racecourse.
Pre-race favourite Ski Paradise, the winner at the Keio Spring Cup three  weeks ago, could not keep the momentum as the French filly finished fifth with  top Japanese jockey Yutaka Take in the saddle.
