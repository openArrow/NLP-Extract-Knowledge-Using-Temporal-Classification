The paper-thin show-court programme was in virtual tatters by  mid-afternoon and at one stage, if Ivanisevic's match had been over in  straight-sets, organisers would have needed to find replacement doubles  matches to appease the 16,000 paying customers.
Earlier Martina Navratilova had done her best to slow things down.
Making her farewell appearance she was involved in a hard-fought  two-and-a-half hour women's doubles match in what was probably her last  centre-court appearance.
Navratilova, 37 and retiring at the end of the year, joined forces with  Manon Bollegraf of the Netherlands in a bid to add another victory to her  already formidable record of seven women's doubles triumphs at the event.
But the Czech-born American and her Dutch partner, seeded fourth, had  their path into the quarter-finals barred by third-round French opponents  Julie Halard and Nathalie Tauziat.
The French players came back after a shaky start to score a 2-6, 7-6  (7/3), 6-3 win.
Navratilova, who is fifth-seeded in the mixed-doubles with Australian Mark  Woodforde, has won two singles, seven doubles and two mixed doubles titles at  the French Open since she made her debut here in 1973.
The winner of a record 167 singles title, the former world number-one was  beaten in the first round of the singles last week.
