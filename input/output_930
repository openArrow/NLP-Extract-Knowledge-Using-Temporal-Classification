The Philippines expects two billion dollars' worth  of new aid commitments in a meeting with donor agencies and governments in  Paris in July, Economic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito said here on Monday.
Habito said in a statement that the July 20-22 "pledging session" for the  Philippine Assistance Program (PAP) in the French capital would complete  agreements already discussed with donors over the past year.
A provisional agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a  three-year, 650 million-dollar programme has allowed Manila to convene the PAP  meeting and rescheduling talks with the Paris Club of official creditors.
The PAP was established in 1989 to pool official development assistance to  the Philippines, which has rebounded from a debt crisis in the mid-1980s but  has yet to catch up with fast-growing neighbors.
Habito said PAP aid commitments totalled slightly more than 10 billion  dollars from 1989 to 1993, with the World Bank and Japan's Overseas Economic  Cooperation Fund accounting for more than two-thirds of the total.
More than half of the funds went to energy, transportation and water  resources.
Habito said Manila had improved its record on using available PAP funds,  tapping 81 percent last year, a three percentage point improvement.
Donors in the past criticized Manila for failing to maximize aid because  of red tape and lack of domestic counterpart funds to get projects moving.
