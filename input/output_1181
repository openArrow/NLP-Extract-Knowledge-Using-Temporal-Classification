Some 500 prison inmates went on a rampage  setting clothes, mattresses and the prison roof on fire after a prisoner was  shot and wounded during a botched escape attempt, authorities said.
Thirty people were injured in the riot that was quelled after a six-hour  siege by prison guards using tear gas and pellet rifles.
The riot, the worst seen in Valparaiso's 100-year-old maximum security  prison, began after police thwarted an escape attempt by three prisoners, one  of whom was shot in the leg.
