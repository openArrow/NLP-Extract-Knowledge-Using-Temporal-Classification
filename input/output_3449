Government troops have driven the Khmer Rouge  out of Treng, the government's original frontline position in northwest  Cambodia before an offensive against the rebel capital Pailin two months ago,  officials said Tuesday.
Royal armed forces took Treng on Monday, but the number of casualties was  still unknown, Defence Minister Tea Banh told AFP by telephone. He added that  the town had been completely demolished by the Khmer Rouge.
Finance Minister Sam Rainsy told reporters at Phnom Penh airport that the  town had fallen, and that "the situation is now exactly the same as the day we  started our military operation to attack the Khmer Rouge."
He was referring to an ill-fated offensive in which government troops  captured Pailin, before losing it one month later, and being driven back to  within 15 kilometers (nine miles) of Cambodia's second city of Battambang.
But he added that although this was "exactly the same situation as a few  months ago... in the meantime we have lost hundreds of lives, millions of  dollars... for nothing."
Sam Rainsy was seeing off co-premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun  Sen, on their way to peace talks with the Khmer Rouge Friday in North Korea.
Government and military officials in the capital said they had retaken  Treng more than three weeks ago, a claim that was refuted by officers in  Battambang.
