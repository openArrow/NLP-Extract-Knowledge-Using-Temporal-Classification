A compromise over Formula One safety measures could  be on the cards after the sport's teams and drivers met here on Saturday.
World governing body FIA announced sweeping changes following the deaths  of Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna at the San Marino grand prix and the  accident here which left Austrian Karl Wendlinger in a coma.
Saturday's meeting, chaired by President of the Formula One Constructors'  Association Bernie Ecclestone, is to pave the way for more meetings here on  Monday between team mechanics and owners.
They will discuss if the safety changes can be introduced within FIA's  deadline and are confident the governing body can be persuaded to relax its  tight schedule.
The drivers, who have just revived the drivers' association, were  represented on Saturday by former world champion Nicki Lauda, Gerhard Berger,  Michael Schumacher and Christian Fittipaldi.
FIA orginally announced cars would need to be radically adapted by the  grand prix in Spain (May 29), Canada (June 12) and Germany (July 31). Measures  include cutting speed and downforce on the cars, with more protection for  drivers.
