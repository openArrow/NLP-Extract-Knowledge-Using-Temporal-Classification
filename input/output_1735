Ukrainian deputies Wednesday elected pro-Russian  Alexander Moroz as the new parliamentary speaker.
Moroz, 50, was backed by former prime minister Leonid Kuchma's moderate  reformers, the communists and the centrist Agrarian Party who are all in favor  of closer ties with Russia.
He was elected with the votes of 171 out of 322 legislators present.
Moroz, a former engineer and expert in political science, is a candidate  in presidential elections on June 26.
He was deputy chairman of the Agrarian Party in the old Ukrainian  parliament and is now the head of the Socialist Party which claims a  membership of 95,000.
His closest rival in Wednesday's election was centrist Vassili Durdiniets  who garnered 103 of the votes.
The other candidates were Alexander Karpov, a communist; Vladimir  Yavorinski, a writer and advocate of victims of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear  disaster; Mikhail Pavlovski and Vyacheslav Chornovyl, who ran on a ticket of  the nationalist Rukh movement; ultra-rightist Yuri Tyma, pro-industry Vitali  Masol and Yekaterina Vashchuk of the United Women movement.
The election came on the first day of a two-day parliamentary debate.
The full parliament has 450 seats but only 336 deputies were elected  during elections in March and April (eds. correct). The remainder are to be  chosen during elections in July.
