A mission from the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) left Pyongyang Saturday, winding up a five-day visit, the Korean  Central News Agency said in a brief dispatch monitored here.
The team, led by Dimitri Perricos of the agency's safeguards department,  has failed to persuade North Korea to allow IAEA inspectors to check the  refuelling of a nuclear reactor, the IAEA headquarters in Vienna said.
The IAEA said two senior agency officials were returning to Vienna but two  inspectors would remain at the North Korean nuclear complex to assess the  situation.
During a stopover at Beijing airport, Perricos was quoted by the Kyodo  news agency as saying "the results of the consultations are a failure. They  (North Koreans) have not accepted to stop the refueling."
"They offered a procedure which was not technically vaild for future  verification by the agency," he said.
He added that the two remaining IAEA officials at Yongbyon would  "continue observation of the discharge operation."
