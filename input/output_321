Rwandan rebels said Friday that they have taken  control half of the country after five weeks of heavy fighting with government  forces during which tens of thousands of people have died.
Fighters of the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) said in a radio broadcast  monitored here by the BBC that the districts of Byumba, half of Ruhengeri in  the north, Kibungu in the east and a large part of the capital, Kigali had  fallen to rebel forces.
"In short, the RPF largely controls more than half of Rwandan territory,"  the rebel Radio Muhabura said.
RPF guerrillas on Friday captured Gako, a camp previously occupied by  government troops in the Bugesera region, about 30 kilometres (26 miles) south  of Kigali, the radio added.
In a separate report, the radio said RPF officials had been meeting  President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire to discuss a ceasefire document signed by  the interim Rwandan government. It gave no details.
Rebel officials refused to endorse the proposed ceasefire because it was  signed by army officers on behalf of the government, which the RPF does not  recognize, the radio said.
"The RPF has always rejected any talks with the illegitimate government in  Rwanda but the front has always invited the Rwandese government forces for  talks aimed at stopping the military hostilities between the two sides," the  radio added.
Rwanda plunged back into civil war pitting the RPF, drawn mainly from the  Tutsi minority, against the Hutu-dominated army and pro-government militias  after Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in suspicious plane crash  on April 6.
Hundreds of thousands of Rwandans, Tutsis and Hutus, have fled into  neighbouring countries to escape the bloodbath, in what aid agencies say is  one of the biggest refugees exodus they have faced.
