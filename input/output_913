The final decision to shut down the controversial  Chernobyl nuclear power plant will be taken in July during the Group of Seven  meeting in Naples, Italy, the Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valery Shmarov  said Monday.
Shmarov, quoted by ITAR-TASS news agency, said the Ukraine would need 10  years to shut down the plant and up to eight billion dollars.
Kiev has insisted that it would be impossible to immediately close the  plant because the country has a severe energy crisis.
Shmarov said Ukraine plans to begin producing its own nuclear fuel but he  did not provide any other specifics.
Kiev currently receives fuel for its five nuclear plants from Russia in  exchange for the dismantling of the nuclear arsenal it inherited from the  Soviet Union.
Military experts from the Group of Seven most industrialized countries  visited Chernobyl earlier this month and called for its shutdown while  promising that members states would provide financial aid for the operation.
Chernobyl was the site of the world's worst civilian nuclear accident on  April 23, 1986, when the number four reactor exploded, releasing a huge  radioactive cloud.
