Attacks on people are 25 times more common in  Finland than in the European Union and other Nordic countries, according to a  report presented at the Finnish Medical Federation's spring seminar Thursday.
More than three violent acts on persons per 100,000 people are inflicted  in Finland, compared to only one or less in Germany, Holland, Spain, Britain  and Ireland, the report said.
According to the report, the violence is mostly by offenders in the 15 to  39 age bracket.
The report blamed the high number of violent crimes on television and  domestic violence.
