German President-elect Roman Herzog immediately  took sides in one of the country's most divisive debates Monday, coming out  strongly in favour of double nationality for people of foreign descent born in  Germany.
Speaking on television hours after being elected the country's next head  of state by a special federal assembly, Herzog said, "I am in favour of it,"  in a blow to the vast majority of the conservative camp which voted him in.
Children born in Germany of foreign parents "must have an honourable and  decent right to a homeland," Herzog, said, following the opinion of outgoing  president Richard von Weizsaecker.
He said that an earlier much-criticised statement, which seemed to imply  that foreigners rejecting German nationality should return to their countries  of origin, had been misquoted.
The present German law makes dual nationality virtually impossible.  Pressure for such immigrant minorities as Turkish Kurds to be allowed German  citizenship to safeguard them from explulsion to possible persecution in  Turkey has met fierce opposition from the resurgent right.
Herzog, 60, won 696 votes, an absolute majority of the 1,324-member  assembly, in the third round of voting by federal members of parliament and  regional delegates gathered in the historic Berlin Reichstag, after the  liberal Free Democrats withdrew their candidate.
The Social Democrats' candidate Johannes Rau won 605 votes.
In an emotional acceptance speech Herzog, a conservative jurist, pledged  to be "the president of all Germans" and abroad to represent a Germany  "without internal tensions."
