The UN Security Council renewed the mandate  of peacekeepers on the strategic Golan Heights seized by Israel from Syria on  Thursday.
The mandate was renewed for six months because the situation was a  potential power keg even though there is no fighting at present, according to  Ibrahim Gambari, the Nigerian ambassador and the president of the UN Security  Council for this month.
An estimated 1,000 peacekeepers from Austria, Canada and Poland are  currently on the strategic plateau seized by Israel in 1967. The force was  sent in May 1974 to implement a ceasefire between Syria and Israel.
