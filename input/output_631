The Egyptian interior ministry announced the arrest  of almost 100 suspected Islamic militants in a sweep against fundamentalists  who have been leading a two-year campaign to topple the government.
It said 98 people had been arrested following information received after a  police raid on the home of Talaat Yassin Hammam, head of the Jamaa Islamiyya's  (Islamic Group) armed wing, who was shot dead in the incident.
The ministry said late Saturday that the 98 were to appear before a court.
Meanwhile the Egyptian bar association has called a strike Sunday to  protest the death of 32-year-old lawyer Abdel Hareth Madani who died in  detention at the end of April.
The association has said that Madani was tortured to death, and also plans  to march on the headquarters of President Honsi Mubarak on Tuesday to  highlight the case.
But the interior ministry warned "elements supporting terrorism against  any attempts to provoke trouble under any pretext" to protest Madani's death.
The interior ministry said in a statement Saturday that he had died from  an asthma attack before even being questioned. It said his asthma attack had  started at his home and that Madani had been immediately taken to hospital  where he later died.
But earlier in the week the prosecutors' office had said initial autopsies  had shown he had been tortured to death.
Madani had been arrested on allegations that he had been acting as a  go-between for jailed Jamaa members and those living abroad, the ministry  said, adding it had found documents to prove the allegations.
The ministry added that Madani had also been liaising between Jamaa and  the armed wing's leader Hammam.
