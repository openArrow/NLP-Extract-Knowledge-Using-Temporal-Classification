Exiled dissident Alexander Solzhenitsyn  will leave his Vermont home Wednesday after 18 years to return to his native  Russia, his son Ignat said Monday.
The Nobel literature laureate who was imprisoned for criticizing Josef  Stalin and exiled for his writings exposing Soviet prison camps, was expected  to be in Moscow within several days.
"He is going back for good," said Ignat Solzhenitsyn, the youngest son of  the writer and his wife Natalia.
The former dissident was expected to travel via Vladivostok in the Russian  Far East with his wife and two other sons, Ermolai and Stepan. They were  expected to stop in Magadan, a former prison camp, on the way back to the  Russian capital.
But his precise travel plans were not disclosed as the writer had signed a  contract for exclusive news coverage with the British Broadcasting  Corporation, his son Ignat said.
Ignat Solzenhitsyn repeated the family's appreciation to the residents of  the tiny Vermont village where the family was able to live out of the public  eye.
"We are very thankful to the people of Cavendish, because owing to them we  were able to live in relative privacy," he said.
Ignat Solzhenitsyn, who now lives in Philadelphia, said he would remain in  Vermont to supervise the move. His two brothers were expected to return to the  United States after travelling to Moscow.
Construction on the writer's home in Moscow, being built on land leased  from the city of Moscow, has been beset by problems, the son noted.
Alexander Solzhenitsyn, known for "The Gulag Archipelago" and other  writings on Soviet Prison camps, has his citizenship restored in 1990 by  former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev.
