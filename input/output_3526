Cameroon's World Cup captain Stephen Tataw has  appealed to his head of state to restore order in their World Cup training  camp.
Tataw asked president Paul Biya to intervene after French coach Henri  Michel clashed with agents handling their international fixtures.
The agents have threatened legal action after Michel refused to let his  team play one match in France.
Cameroon lost 4-1 to Italian side Juventus last Saturday in their latest  warm-up match on a tour of Europe.
Last week 42-year-old Roger Milla, who will be the oldest World Cup  finalist if he is picked, appealed for Biya to sort out what he called a  shambolic team camp.
But Milla's presence alone is contributing to the strain.
Francois Omam-Biyik, who scored the winner in the 1990 World Cup opening  match against Argentina, said the younger players resented the attention Milla  was getting.
"He was a great player but we have younger players who are better," he  said.
