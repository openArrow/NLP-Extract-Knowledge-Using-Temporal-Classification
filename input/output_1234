The prefect and police chief of the northern Italian  town of Vicenza were fired by new Interior Minister Roberto Maroni for  allowing a weekend demonstration by skinheads in their town, a government  source said Tuesday.
The source said that police chief Romano Argegno and prefect Michele De  Feis were sacked Monday and have been asked to provide an explanation as to  why they allowed some 300 skinheads to demonstrate in Vicenza Saturday  screaming racist slogans and bearing swastikas.
The event sparked widespread condemnation and prompted the government to  issue a nationwide ban on any similar future demonstrations.
