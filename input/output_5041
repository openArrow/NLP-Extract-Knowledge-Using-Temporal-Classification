One person was killed and four were wounded  Saturday in a missile attack on the southern Yemeni capital Aden, even though  the missile was shot down, a southern Yemeni military statement said.
Southern anti-aircraft batteries shot the missile apart, but debris fell  on the Sheikh Osman district in the north of the city, killing one person, the  statement said.
Witnesses said they heard anti-aircraft fire and a muffled explosion and a  flash in the sky around 10:30 p.m. (1930 GMT).
Northern Yemeni forces have periodically fire Soviet-made Luna missiles at  Aden during the night, but most of them have been downed by southern  anti-aircraft batteries.
Three more dull thuds were heard around 2:00 a.m. in Aden on Sunday,  although it was not clear what had caused them.
Southern Yemen on Saturday appealed to Jordan to intervene to stop the  civil war that broke out between the former North and South Yemen on May 5,  according to official sources here.
Anis Hassan Yahia, chairman of the Provisional Assembly of National  Salvation, the week-old caretaker parliament of the newly-proclaimed  Democratic Republic of Yemen, sent the message to Jordanian parliamentary  speaker Taher al-Masri, the source said.
Yahia had asked for the "rapid intervention" of Jordan with the aim of  "stopping the war, returning the warring armies to their original positions  and starting immediate negotiations without preconditions under the aegis of  the Arab League," he said.
Jordan brokered a Yemeni peace accord in Amman last February 20, but the  move to ease relations between the two Yemens, which had never fully  integrated despite their unification in 1990, remained a dead letter.
Amman last Sunday reaffirmed its commitment to a united Yemen recognised  in international law.
Meanwhile Yemeni Foreign Minister Mohamed Bassandawa, a northerner,  arrived Saturday in Cairo for the Non-Aligned Movement's meeting of foreign  ministers, opening on Tuesday.
Bassandawa told reporters he had brought a message for Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak from Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Saleh about the situation in  Yemen.
He also met his Egyptian counterpart Amr Mussa, who told reporters Egypt  and the Gulf states had asked the United Nations Security Council to look into  the Yemeni civil war.
Mussa stressed that a ceasefire had to be secured to stop the situation  deterioriating.
UN sources in New York said Oman had on Friday submitted to the Security  Council a draft resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Yemen and the  renewal of negotiations between the warring sides.
