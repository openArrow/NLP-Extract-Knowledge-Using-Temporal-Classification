BANGKOK, May 18 (AFP) - US anti-narcotics authorities have linked 17 Thai  politicans, 10 of them currently in office, to the drug trade and have denied  US visas to three of them, local dailies reported Wednesday.
Foreign Minister Prasong Soonsiri told the Thai cabinet Tuesday that 10  members of parliament, all in opposition parties, were named on a list  supplied by the US eembassy, the reports said.
Prasong said he had sent letters detailing the allegations to the Office  of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB), Thailand's anti-drug division, and the  interior ministry, which controls police affairs, an unnamed source was cited  as saying.
The US Embassy, the ONCB, the foreign ministry and the interior ministry  were unwilling to comment Wednesday.
Interior Minister Chaowalit Yongchaiyudh told reporters he had not  received any information on the matter but had "heard of two or three people"  who had been denied visas to the United States.
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, who said the 1979 Narcotics Supression  Act prevents the prosecution of Thais for drug crimes committed in other  countries, has stated categorically that Thais would not be extradited for  trial elsewhere.
