Beaten Kentucky Derby favorite Holy  Bull will miss the Preakness with minor physical problems, the colt's  owner-trainer Jimmy Croll said Friday.
"There were a couple of things wrong," Croll said. "Nothing drastic, but  the vet said it would be better to give him seven or eight extra days."
Croll said there was nothing wrong with Holy Bull when he finished 12th in  the Kentucky Derby last Saturday, a defeat he called "strictly a bad case of  circumstances."
Holy Bull was bumped at the start of the Derby and slammed again in the  first turn on the muddy Churchill Downs track.
Croll still plans to run Holy Bull in the one and one-half mile Belmont  Stakes, the final race of the Triple Crown.
