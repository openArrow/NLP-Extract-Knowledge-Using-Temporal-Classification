Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Wednesday  justified his decision to issue economic decrees without consulting parliament  on the grounds of "the imperative need to get the country out of economic  crisis."
His office said he had sent a letter to the Duma and Council of the  Federation, the lower and upper houses of parliament, explaining why he had  signed the five decrees on Monday without taking the time to consult either  body.
The decrees involved the lifting of numerous export quotas, notably on  oil, a lowering of 10 to 20 percent of taxes on businesses, fiscal privileges  in the first few years for foreign investors as well as strengthening the  state's powers to combat misappropriation of state subsidies, non-payment of  debts between businesses and fiscal fraud.
In his letter Yeltsin said he had acted because existing legislation would  not provide the right conditions for an effective reform of the economy.
He said he was exercising his prerogatives under the constitution and  fulfilling his duties and obligations under the civil pact signed by most of  his political and social partners.
He said he had ordered the government to present draft legislation on the  basis of the decrees, which would have the force of law until the new laws  were adopted.
Only the decree on lowering taxes on business would not enter into force  until it had been approved by parliament, he added.
