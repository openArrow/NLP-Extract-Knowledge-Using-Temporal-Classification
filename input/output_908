The bank of Portugal spent nearly 250 billion  escudos (1.45 billion dollars) in foreign currency to defend the escudo in  March and April, the central bank said on Monday.
In April the bank used 43 billion escudos (250 million dollars) to support  the escudo in addition to 205.7 billion escudos used in March.
The sum of 250 billion escudos represented seven percent of the bank's  official liquid reserves which amounted to 3,663 billion escudos (21.30  billion dollars).
Speculation against the escudo, which forced the central bank to suspend  its regular money-market intervention rates at the beginning of April, was  triggered by a statement by Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva concerning a  possible reduction of bank rates by two percentage points by the end of the  year.
This was interpreted by speculators as signifying that the current policy  of ensuring stability for the currency might be abandoned.
