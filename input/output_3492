President Nelson Mandela prepared to spell out  his plans to build the new South Africa in a keynote address Tuesday to the  first working session of the full post-apartheid legislature.
Hours before the new president's state of the nation address, the  country's Constitutional Assembly met to choose its chairman, electing Cyril  Ramaphosa, the secretary-general of the African National Congress (ANC).
Mandela's speech, to be debated in coming days, was expected to deal  largely with his Reconstruction and Development Programme, the backbone of the  ANC's economic and social platform.
The main task of the Constitutional Assembly, made up of the 400 National  Assembly members elected last month and 90 Senators from the country's new  provinces, is to give South Africa's country's constitution its final shape  over the next five years.
Ramaphosa was the ANC's chief negotiator in the arduous and complicated  democracy negotiations that wrote the current interim basic law, which came  into effect with the historic all-race election.
The deputy chair went to the former manpower minister Leon Wessels in the  last white minority National Party government. Both he and Ramaphosa were  unopposed for their positions.
The high-profile Ramaphosa, 40, had chosen to remain outside Mandela's  national unity government when he lost the coveted post of first deputy  president to ANC national chairman and international department head Thabo  Mbeki.
As the parliament, met, final preparations were under way for Tuesday  afternoon's first formal session of the ANC-dominated national assembly.
