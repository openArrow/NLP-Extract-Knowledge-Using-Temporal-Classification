Share prices recovered Tuesday after an early slump  caused by fears of rising interest rates, dealers said.
The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares ended the day at 2,970.5, up 0.1  percent on Friday's close after the bank holiday weekend.
In Paris, the CAC 40 index ended the day down 1.10 percent at 2,029.90  points.
Shares in London initially fell after the announcement of a 0.2 percent  progression in May of the British monthly M0 money supply data, a figure  higher than expected, which fuelled fears of inflationary pressures and a rise  in British interest rates.
Share prices also fell sharply on news that the Bundesbank had cancelled  its June bond issue, dealers said.
But the recovery of guilts and of the futures markets later allowed for a  turn-around.
