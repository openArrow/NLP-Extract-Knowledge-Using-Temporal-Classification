A US-led invasion of Haiti could easily remove  the military and reinstate President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, but an  international force would have to stay for years, The New York Times reported  Monday.
The newspaper noted that a force of 650 Marines sent to Guantanamo Bay for  training last week of the kind US officials said might serve as an invasion  vanguard.
But administration officials, determined not to repeat the mistakes made  in Somalia, told the Times that no invasion would be launched without a firm  plan for disengagement.
"The view of the intelligence community is unambiguous that restoring  Aristide through military force would be a simple proposition, but withdrawing  international forces quickly after that step would be extremely unlikely," a  senior intelligence official was quoted as saying.
Even if there is a diplomatic solution, the official said, "maintaining  order represents a long-term proposition."
Administration officials cited by the Times said a peacekeeping force of  several thousand would be needed to retrain the military, keep order and  protect Aristide at least until his term ends in December 1995.
Plans are sketchy and the United States and its allies have not agreed on  the size or duties of a peacekeeping force, or the extent of a US role or how  long such a force would stay, the Times said.
US and Canadian defense officials meeting in Ottawa recently discussed a  plan to form the nucleus of a new police force with Haitian expatriates from  Montreal and New York, the report said.
Meanwhile, the United States is trying to tighten enforcement of a UN  embargo on Haiti to put greater pressure on the military leadership in Haiti  to step down.
Rear Admiral John Mazach told reporters at Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba  that ship traffic to Haiti has been cut down by the US blockade but smaller  boats were still slipping through with vital supplies.
