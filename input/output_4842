The row with Albania intensified on Thursday following reports here of a  police operation against the Greek minority, which lives in an impoverished  area in the south of the country that Greek ultra-nationalists want to annex.
Albanian authorities denied that any repression had taken place.  Prosecutor General Alush Draghoshi said 30 people had been summoned to testify  in connection with an investigation involving members of the Greek community.
But "'testify' does not mean arrest," he stressed.
The Greek foreign ministry on Friday called in the 11 European Union  ambassadors here to appeal for help in arbitrating the dispute.
"Greece wants the dispute to be taken up by the European Union," one EU  ambassador said.
Athens in mid-May blocked an EU aid package of 35 million ecus (40.25  million dollars) destined for Albania, accusing the country of flagrant  violations of human rights.
US State Department spokesman Mike McCurry angered the Greeks earlier this  week with a statement that Washington had found "no credible proof" that the  Albanian government had been mistreating its Greek minority.
Papandreou on Friday charged that the US position had "encouraged  Berisha's arrogant, aggressive and provocative attitude."
Athens has among other things accused Albania of denying the Greek  community the right to educate their children in Greek.
