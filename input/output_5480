A team of three European Union ministers began  financial talks with senior members of the conflict-wracked Algerian  government here Monday.
Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes and Greek and German Deputy Foreign  Ministers Georges Papandreou and Dieter Kastrup, arrived earlier on a mission  to assess the political and economic situation in Algeria, officials said.
They went immediately into talks with Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi.
Also attending the talks were Algerian Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah  Dembri, Finance Minister Ahmed Benbitour, Small and Medium Enterprises  Minister Mourad Benachenhou and Industry and Energy Minister Amar Makhloui.
Benbitour will on Tuesday present the Paris Club of creditor nations, in  Paris, with Algeria's request for a rescheduling of its estimated 26 billion  dollar foreign debt, officials said.
The finance minister late Sunday told national television that Algeria  hopes to conclude two agreements for 1994 and 1995.
The European ministers were to report back to the European Union on  prospects for the provision of credit facilities.
Papandreou said on his arrival that the visit was a "signal of European  support for Algeria's economic reform programme" and commended the country on  its stand-by credit agreement signed with the International Monetary Fund  (IMF) early last month.
Algeria has been plunged into a state of near civil war between Moslem  extremist guerrillas and the security forces since the cancellation in January  1992 of the second round of a general election the fundamentalist Islamic  Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win.
The conflict has claimed more than 3,000 lives and seen foreign workers  and residents and Algerian intellectuals targetted in a wave of terrorist  attacks.
The three European ministers were due to give a press conference following  their meetings.
