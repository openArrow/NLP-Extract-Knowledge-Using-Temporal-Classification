Football is a relatively recent import to Saudi  Arabia, but with royal backing and a World Cup berth the game's popularity is  exploding like an oil well fire.
King Fahd and his sports-mad sons poured millions of dollars into reaching  the 1994 World Cup finals in the United States.
Extravagant gifts were given to everyone involved in the success in the  six-nation regional qualifying tournament in Doha last October.
Such patronage has allowed the creation of a professionnal league in a  country that was a soccer desert 35 years ago.
Saudi wealth attracted coaches of the calibre of Maria Zagalo, who won the  World Cup with Brazil as a player and manager, and Carlos Alberto Pereira. But  it has also given the royal family-dominated federation a prowerful say in  team affairs.
Such input makes the national manager's position precarious.
Brazilian Jose Candido, who took the Saudis to the Doha tournament, quit  over outside interference.
Candido was seen arguing with Saudi officials in the middle of the game  against Iraq, apparently over a call from Riyadh demanding the substitution of  goalkeeper Mohammed al-Deayea.
After the keeper came off, the Brazilian was heard to say the Saudi  campaign would go on "without me."
Former Dutch international Leo Beenhakker was drafted as replacement, but  his European approach clashed with the South American style admired by Saudi  football officials.
His players also reportedly balked at Beenhakker's demands for twice a day  workouts, and he was fired on February 23.
Jorge Solari of Argentina is the latest man aboard the coaching carousel.
Solari, one of the players branded an animal by Sir Alf Ramsey after the  brutal England-Argentina quarter-final in the 1966 World Cup, was recommended  to King Fahd by Argentine president Carlos Menem.
