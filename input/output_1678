US stock and bond markets continued to rally  early Wednesday, buoyed by investor enthusiasm sparked a day earlier by the  Federal Reserve's increase in two key short-term interest rates.
The Dow Jones index of 30 leading industrials was up 8.29 points at  3,728.90 several minutes after the session opened on the New York Stock  Exchange.
Tuesday the Dow jumped 49.11 points to close at 3,720.61 as investors  appeared reassured that another Fed rate hike would be unlikely in the next  few months.
Analysts hedged about the duration of the markets' rally. James Schroeder,  an analyst at MMS International, predicted a temporary downward correction  from profit taking. The Dow, Wall Street's principal barometer, should rebound  as high as 3,750 points, he said.
"If things falter over the next few days we'll know it was a temporary  fire," Schroeder said.
David Shulman, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said the market would  climb, especially in the short run, because "the Fed is out of the way for a  while now."
On the bond market, interest rates on the main 30-year Treasury bond  averaged 7.25 percent, down slightly from 7.26 percent late Tuesday.
