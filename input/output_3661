The commander of an honour guard for foreign heads of  state denied Tuesday afternoon that seven of his troops had yelled Nazi and  racist slogans while drunk.
After questioning his men for several hours, Lieutenant Colonel Stephan  Schaefer denied the events had taken place.
He charged that the account of the insults, reported earlier in the day by  police, had been fabricated by a conscientious objector.
Police earlier said that the seven were off duty and in civilian dress  when they began shouting "gas the Jews" and "foreigners out" Thursday on a bus  in Siegburg, near Bonn. They also attacked a passenger.
The bus driver locked the vehicle's doors and called the police, they said.
Bonn's public prosecutor confirmed an inquiry was under way into several  members of the armed forces for inciting racial hatred and assault.
Schaefer admitted one of his recruits had slapped a passenger because he  had refused to allow the soldier to sit next to him.
But the commander said the shouting of the slogans had been invented by a  conscientious objector who, on getting on the bus, referred to the troops as  "Bundeswehr idiots."
At least three people were killed during 1992 by soldiers implicated in  extreme rightwing violence. Troops and non-commissioned officers have also  been involved in attacks on homes for asylum-seekers.
Despite what officials called "regrettable incidents," authorities do not  believe there is a hard core of ultra-right extremists in Germany's  370,000-strong armed forces.
