Red Rodney, the jazz trumpeter who  replaced Miles Davis in Charlie Parker's group, has died here of lung cancer.  He was 66.
Rodney, who died Friday at his home here, played with many of the greatest  big-band leaders of his day -- Jimmy Dorsey, Gene Krupa, Woody Herman and  Benny Goodman.
Born Robert Chudnick, Rodney was influenced by Harry James. But fellow  trumpeter Howard McGee introduced him to be-bop jazz, which led to Rodney's  best-known professional association -- with Charlie Parker, be-bop's  originator.
He joined Parker's group in 1949 and soon began recording under his own  name.
He recorded with Ira Sullivan in the 1950s while also working as a society  band leader in Philadelphia. In the 1960s, he underwent drug rehabilitation  and played with a pit band in Las Vegas.
He returned to jazz after suffering a stroke in 1973, playing with Dizzy  Gillespie and Sullivan. He served as an advisor to the Clint Eastwood film  "Bird," the story of Parker's life.
Rodney is survived by his wife, Helene, and two sons from a previous  marriage.
