South Africa has officially rejoined the  International Labour Organisation (ILO) after three decades of absence during  the apartheid years, the ILO announced on Friday.
The return of South Africa after last month's first all-race elections  will enable the ILO to assist in the economic and social reconstruction of the  newly established democracy, an ILO spokesman said.
An action plan for South Africa will be put to the annual conference of  the ILO next month, focussing on job creation, the promotion of businesses,  labour law and health and safety concerns, the spokesman said.
According to recent studies cited in an ILO report, 47.9 percent of the  South African workforce is underemployed and of 400,000 people who joined the  labour market in 1994, only 23,000 found jobs.
The report noted that 60 percent of the population is illiterate and that  17 million South Africans live below the poverty line.
But while it was clear that real wage levels in South Africa would have to  rise, this should be accompanied by higher productivity to avoid creating  unemployment and boosting inflation, the report said.
With South Africa's return, the ILO numbers 171 countries.
