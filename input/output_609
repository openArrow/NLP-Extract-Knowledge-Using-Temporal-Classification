The French Coflexip Group is to build a  55-million dollar (40 million US) production plant at Fremantle near here to  supply the international oil and gas industry, the government announced Sunday.
Under a deal signed in Paris by West Australian state premier Richard  Court and Coflexip directors, an 8.5-million dollar government assistance  package will be provided for the plant.
It will manufacture advanced flexible pipelines, mainly for undersea use.
Court, currently visiting Europe, said in a statement released here the  project would bring 200 new jobs to Fremantle and assist Government efforts to  establish Western Australia as a major regional centre for the international  oil and gas industry.
"Over the next 10 years, billions of dollars will be spent developing  off-shore petroleum fields below the North West Shelf, Timor Sea, Indo-Malay  Archipelago, and the South China Sea," Court said.
"For Coflexip to decide to establish its manufacturing centre in Western  Australia will be recognition of the part the state will be playing in the  development."
The state's growing expertise on the North West Shelf oil and gas field  meant it was ideally placed to help manage, service and supply the industry.
Court said the government had been working to encourage companies like  Coflexip to establish their Asian regional headquarters in Perth.
The Coflexip board is due to meet next month to give final approval for  the plant, which should be ready for full production by July next year, the  statement said.
