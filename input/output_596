A tornado and thunderstorms stopped play in  the second round of the Byron Nelson Classic Saturday afternoon as organizers  struggled to get the weather-disrupted event back on track.
Ben Crenshaw, David Ogrin, Mark Carnevale and Brad Bryant were all at  eight-under-par when play was abandoned for the day.
Only six players in the 156-strong field completed two rounds on Saturday  -- the goal of organizers after play was completely washed out on both  Thursday and Friday.
Three golfers pulled out of the event and 147 marked their balls on the  two courses being used. They were to return Sunday morning as tournament  officials tried to get through 54 holes by Sunday evening.
Local police said a tornado touched down on the Cottonwood Valley golf  course, jumped over the tournament press center and dissipated on Saturday  afternoon.
Cottonwood Valley, located across the street from the Tournament Players  Club at Las Colinas, was called into use for Saturday's double round.
Ogrin led after the first round with a 64 on the par 71 Cottonwood layout,  where Mark Carnevale shot a 65.
Jesper Parnevik of Sweden, Nick Price of Zimbabwe and Tommy Armour all  shot 65, but they were on the par-70 Las Colinas course, so they were two  behind in relation to par.
Crenshaw shot a first-round 66 at Las Colinas and was four-under for the  second round at Cottonwood with four to play when the storms halted the second  round.
Bryant, also had four to play at Cottonwood, while Ogrin had three left at  Las Colinas and Carnevale had five.
"It's a shame," Crenshaw said of the afternoon disruption. "If you're  scheduled to play 36 holes in a day you want to go ahead and play 36 holes.
"Nobody likes to start and stop. That's tournament golf."
