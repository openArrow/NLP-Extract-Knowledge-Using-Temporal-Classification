steady, then higher. After breaking through the 16-dollars-per-barrel  level last week for the first time since November 1993, the price of Brent  crude North Sea flucutated in technical trading before rising towards the end  of the week.
Figures from the American Petroleum Instutite (API) pushed prices slightly  lower during the week, as they showed US stocks had lifted 4.72 million  barrels last week compared with the previous week, while domestic fuel and  gas-oil had lifted 1.39 million barrels.
A rise in US reserves on the NYMEX on Thursday, however, lifted prices  again above the 16-dollars-per-tonne mark.
Civil war in Yemen, which was responsible for price rises two weeks ago,  continued to fuel fears of a cut in production from the country which produces  350,000 barrels per day.
RUBBER: higher. Prices continued to rise, reaching 720 pounds per tonne on  a cut in world production and a rise in demand.
The International Rubber Study Group said the surplus in production would  only be around 10,000 tonnes in 1993, compared with 120,000 tonnes the  previous year.
World produciton is estimated to be around 5.43 million tonnes in 1993,  compared to 5.6 million tonnes in 1992, while consumption is expected to be  5.42 million tonnes from 5.48 million tonnes.
The production of the world's three premier producers, Thailand, Indonesia  and Malaysia, has dropped respectively 1.5 million tonnes, 1.353 million  tonnes and 1.074 million tonnes.
