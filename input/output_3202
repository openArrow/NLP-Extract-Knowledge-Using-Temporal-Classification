An international conference on Asia's growing  security problems, including nuclear proliferation, Burma and Cambodia, opened  in Bangkok Monday.
Eighteen nations were represented at the meeting to lay the groundwork for  the first Asia Regional Forum on Security, to be held in the Thai capital on  July 25.
The United States, European Union, Japan, South Korea, Canada, Australia  and New Zealand, with observers from China, Russia, Vietnam, Laos, Papua New  Guinea, will join for the security forum.
A Thai official said the conference aimed to promote "preventive  diplomacy" and regional security mechanisms that would complement efforts by  the United Nations.
The meeting started by looking at Cambodia, Burma and the rest of  southeast Asia, according to its chairman, Pracha Guna-Kasem, secretary  general at the Thai foreign ministry.
South Korea's deputy foreign ministry, Lee Chang-Choon, was also to report  on the security situation in northeast Asia.
But Lee said the intitial conference would not broach the Korean nuclear  standoff.
Though suspicions that North Korea is developing nuclear weapons remain  "the most sticky security issue in the world, we are going to avoid sensitive  issues which might make some participants uncomfortable," the South Korean  minister explained.
China, a traditional ally of Pyongyang, is at the conference to prepare  the full ministerial meeting in July.
A Canadian official was to give a talk on "preventive diplomacy" and  nuclear nonproliferation, and Australia a report on "confidence-building  measures."
The regional forum will follow the annual Association of Southeast Asian  Nations foreign ministers' meeting in Bangkok on July 22 and July 23.
An envoy from Burma will join the ministers from Thailand, Philippines,  Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei at the ASEAN talks.
