Andretti said he felt McLaren decided to seek a new driver after he bumped  the rear of a car driven by Austria's Karl Wendlinger in a race at   Donnington, England.
"I felt changes within the team after that," he said. "That was my first  big mistake. I guess I wasn't allowed to make a mistake."
The 31-year-old marked his Indy-car return by winning in Australia -- a  victory he hopes proved something to critics.
"It gave me a great feeling and if it shut some people up, fine," he said.  "I can't worry about everybody else because not everybody is an expert."
Andretti will start the May 29 Indy 500 from the middle of the second row,  four places better than his father and two places ahead of Mansell, who drives  the car Michael surrendered to join Formula-One.
That decision cost him the chance to be teamed with his father in the  elder Andretti's final season.
"That's the only thing lacking," he said. "I wish he was my teammate. We  had a great time being together for those four years."
Despite the disappointment of last year, Andretti considers the experience  a benefit.
"I would hate to think it was all for nothing," Andretti said.
"Sometimes your toughest years are your most beneficial. With the  experience I have gained this year, I know the results this year in F1 would  have been 100 percent different."
