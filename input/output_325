Washington's credibility will be badly damaged  if it backs down in the next three weeks in its insistence that China improve  its human rights record to preserve the trade relationship, according to a  report published here Friday.
"US interests are dependent on Washington's credibility, and nobody can  doubt that a major about face on this issue before June 1994 would damage our  credibility, with negative consequences in the future," said the report from a  panel of experts sent to President Bill Clinton.
But in the longer term the panel, set up by the private Council on Foreign  Relations and chaired by former US Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and  Cyrus Vance, urged Clinton to abandon the link between trade and human rights.
"The goals remain important, but this particular policy tool will not  after this year provide the most effective means for pursuing the objective of  bringing China more into acord with generally-accepted international standards  on human rights," the report said.
Clinton has said he will not renew China's most favored nation (MFN)  trading status beyond June 3 unless Beijing shows significant overall progress  on human rights.
The panel urged Clinton to "shift the initiative to the more  forward-looking leaders in Beijing" in the run-up to June 3 in a bid to reach  a solution.
"This requires, we believe, extensive focus on quiet diplomacy and a  potential promise (to Beijing) that successful compliance with human rights  conditions this time will remove conditionality on MFN renewal henceforth."
In the longer term, Washington must develop a balanced relationship with  China in which human rights remained an important concern but where ties had  been normalised so that failures in one realm would not undermine the whole  relationship, added the report.
It noted that China's leaders "bridle and become more obstinate when they  feel they are being treated with contempt," but were more flexible if treated  with respect "but also firmly and convincingly told where the line is drawn."
