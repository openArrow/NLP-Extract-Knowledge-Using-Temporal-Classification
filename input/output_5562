The Security Council's 15 members held an  emergency meeting Monday to review a draft statement on North Korea's nuclear  program, the UN announced.
The meeting came amid mounting concerns about Pyongyang's refuelling of  the Yongbyon nuclear reactor, from which the United States suspects plutonium  may have been diverted for nuclear arms production.
North Korea maintains its nuclear program has only peaceful ends.
The statement under consideration calls on North Korea to allow the  Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to carry out full  inspections of its nuclear facilities.
The text has been approved by the council's five permanent members --  China, France, Britain, Russia and the United States -- who have been meeting  throughout the day.
France had called for UN sanctions to be applied against North Korea if  Pyongyang should prove to have reneged on its commitments to give  international inspectors full access to the nuclear reactor.
But China balked at the idea of sanctions, and was said to have prevailed  in keeping any such threat out of the text.
The IAEA has said that without full inspections it cannot guarantee that  fuel is not being diverted to weapons purposes.
Earlier Monday, South Korean President Kim Young-Sam said the standoff had  entered a "crucial" stage because of North Korea's refusal to allow monitoring  of the discharge of spent reactor fuel rods.
The United States believes North Korea has diverted plutonium in past  years, and says outside checks are essential to determine if the isolated  communist regime has embarked on a nuclear weapons program.
