Italy's neo-fascist leader Gianfranco Fini told  parliament here Friday that his National Alliance (NA) coalition had no links  to "historic fascism."
"Nobody can deny that the NA fully values freedom, pluralism,  anti-totalitarianism as much as we oppose racism and anti-Semitism," Fini told  parliament as legislators were preparing to vote Prime Minister Silvio  Berlusconi's government into office later Friday.
The cabinet which was approved by a short Senate vote Wednesday comprises  five neo-fascists.
Fini said his movement had "nothing to do with historic fascism."
Anti-fascism was "for some time key in introducing democracy" after World  War II, he said. "But not all anti-fascists were anti-totalitarian," he added,  referring to the old communist party which was for years modelled after the  Stalinist Soviet Union's single party.
Fini said the Alliance's legitimacy was based on the ballots of five and a  half million voters in the March legislative election.
Speaking before the deputies' vote, Berlusconi praised Fini for clarifying  the Alliance's position and rejecting "unfounded accusations."
The participation of five Alliance ministers and over 10 junior ministers  in Berlusconi's government has drawn sharp criticism from Italy's European  Union allies and the European parliament.
