A convoy of 238 people had left the Bosnian capital in five busses  Saturday but some refugees were accommodated in Serb-controlled territory in  Bosnia.
Most people who arrived in the spa town of Banja Koviljaca near the  Bosnian border are elderly or sick. They will be taken to other Serbian towns  for medical treatment.
