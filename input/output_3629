Ukrainian and Crimean legislatures agreed Tuesday not  to act on imflammatory resolutions which have sparked a five-day political  crisis, the head of a Ukrainian delegation to bilateral talks here said.
Boris Oleinik said the delegations agreed to "refrain from any new  measures" which might aggravate the situation following the talks fronted by  Crimea's parliamentary speaker Sergei Tsekov and his Ukrainian counterpart  Alexander Moroz.
An unidentified Crimean deputy told the Interfax agency that under the  agreement Crimean deputies pledged not to act on a resolution passed Friday to  implement a 1992 constitution granting the region greater autonomy from Kiev.
The Ukrainian parliament, meanwhile, agreed to hold fire on its own  resolution Friday declaring the move "illegal" and giving the local  legislature up until Monday to reverse its decision, the deputy added.
