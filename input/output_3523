Defending champion Sergi Bruguera looked as though he was about to take up  where he left off last year in the men's singles but suddenly found things  tougher than expected on the centre-court.
The 23-year-old Spaniard had raced 6-1, 6-1, 5-1 clear after one and a  half hours and victory against Czech opponent Martin Damm looked a formality.
But suddenly things started to go badly wrong and 30 minutes later the  sixth-seeded titleholder found himself forced into a tie-break which he  managed to clinch 7-3.
