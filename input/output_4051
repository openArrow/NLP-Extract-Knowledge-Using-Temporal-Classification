Karen Ann Quinlan, who lived 10 years in a  vegetative state, suffered damage to a portion of the brain believed to be  critical to thought and awareness, scientists said.
A report prepared for publication Thursday in the New England Journal of  Medicine said the woman whose case helped launch the right-to-die movement had  the most brain damage in the thalmus, two egg-shaped structures deep inside  the brain.
The researchers, led by Dr. Hannah Kinney of Children's Hospital in  Boston, said the analsysis of Quinlan's brain supports an emerging theory that  the thalmus plays a role in thought an wakefulness but is less important to  wakefulness.
Quinlan suffered a heart attack in 1975 after accidentally mixing alcohol  and sedatives. Her parents won a highly publicized court battle in 1976 to  have her removed from a respirator but she continued to breathe on her own  until she died in 1985 from infection at the age of 31.
In her unusual vegetative state, Quinlan slept and woke each day but  showed no sign of thought or awareness of her surroundings.
Until recently scientists believed such a vegetative state resulted from  damage to the brain's cerebral cortex, the outer surface of the largest and  most developed part of the brain.
Researchers obtained her parents' permission to examine the brain and  preserved the tissue in paraffin to allow it to be sliced thinly for  microscopic examination.
