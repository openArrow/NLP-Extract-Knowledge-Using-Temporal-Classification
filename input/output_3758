North Korea has stepped up its campaign to replace a  Cold War truce mechanism with a peace treaty that would lead to the withdrawal  of the 36,000 US forces here, officials here said Wednesday.
North Korea informed the US-led United Nations Command (UNC) on Tuesday  that it has set up a Korea People's Army (KPA) mission at the border truce  village of Panmunjom, a UNC spokesman said.
The North said the KPA mission was necessary as a new negotiating body to  replace its presence at the Military Armistice Commission (MAC).
"The current situation on the Korean peninsula requires the establishment  of a new peace mechanism," Pyongyang's Korea Central News Agency quoted a  North Korean chief liaison officer as telling the UNC.
"To prevent any war on the Korean peninsula and to have a new system to  guarantee peace, we have opened Panmunjom Mission," Colonel Yu Yong-Chol said.
The UNC spokesman said: "We called for a MAC secretary meeting to discuss  this issue."
North Korea last month unilaterally withdrew from the MAC, calling for the  United States to sign a peace treaty to put an end to the truce that has been  in place since the end of Korean War in 1953.
Analysts here said the North's move on Tuesday was designed to force the  United States to discuss Pyongyang's proposal to replace the truce with a  peace treaty when they resume high-level talks, probably early next month.
The high-level talks will discuss possible diplomatic recognition of the  North by the United States and ways to end rows over the North's nuclear  program, which has aroused international suspicion that it might be used for  weapons.
South Korea has said the US-North Korea high-level talks must not deal  with Pyongyang's proposal to replace the truce with a peace treaty and and  that the two Koreas themselves must discuss the issue.
