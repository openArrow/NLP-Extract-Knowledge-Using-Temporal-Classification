Palestinian police fired on an Israeli car which   drove through a checkpoint between the Gaza Strip and Israel without stopping  on Monday, military sources said.
The Israeli, who was carrying Palestinian workers in his car, told Israeli  radio he had not stopped because he only wanted to be checked by the troops  manning the Israeli side of the crossing.
The Israelis had told him to turn back and as he did so the Palestinians  opened fire, blowing out a tyre but causing no injuries, the sources said.
Under the autonomy agreement, Israeli civilians must present their  identification papers to the Palestinian force.
