Rahal proved that by saying he was thankful for not having to make a  decision he had already made -- choosing to dump the Honda cars.
"I wish it could have been Honda but I'm pleased the ordeal is over,"  Rahal said. "I can't tell you how much I appreciate what Ilmor did. They could  have been difficult because we work with Honda. But they were great. And when  we had a question about handling, Penske gave us a straight answer."
Rahal requalified in a Penske-Ilmor at 224.094 mph (358.550 kms) with  Groff in at 221.355 mph (354.168 kms). Both were about 4 mph (6.4kms) faster  than before.
"With this car, I can win the race," Rahal claimed.
Honda Indy-car director Robert Clarke said the Japanese automaker will  stay with Rahal and Groff the remainder of the season.
"We are certainly disappointed Honda was unable to qualify for its first  500," Clarke said. "Honda will learn from the experience and improve the  engine. We look forward to returning in 1995."
Gugelmin let everyone know what he was doing when he withdrew his already  qualified car and requalified at 223.104 mph (356.966 kms). His previous car  would have been bumped, but he is now safely in the field.
Other drivers seeking speed on the final day of time trials include  Scotland's Jim Crawford, Brazil's Marco Greco, France's Stefan Gregoire,  Finland's Tero Palmroth and Belgium's Didier Theys. Greco and Palmroth aborted  too-slow qualifying bids.
The day produced two minor mishaps.
Colombian-born Roberto Guerrero suffered minor burns during a fire in his  cockpit as it departed the pits, but was later cleared to return to driving.
Gary Bettenhausen's car hit the outercrashed in practice. He was unhurt  but is now a longshot to make the race.
