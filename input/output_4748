British military forces in Berlin staged a glorious  last parade Friday in the city they helped guard for some 40 years of  confrontation with the now-defunct Soviet bloc after World War II.
In their finest regalia, massed pipe and brass bands marched at the  Maifeld (May Field), in what used to be the British sector of the long-divided  city, before civil and military dignitaries including the Prince of Wales.
To take the salute in the moving but melancholy ceremony, Prince Charles  changed his blue lounge suit of earlier in the day for that of  colonel-in-chief of the Gordon Highlanders with Scottish kilt, sporran and  sword.
German civilian employees who served the British forces, and veteran  soldiers of the British Legion, also marched before the prince, who inspected  the guard from an open-topped Range-Rover with horse-mounted escorts.
Four honour guards were mounted by the Queens Lancashire Regiment and the  Queens Colour Squadron of the Royal Airforce from among the last 1,500 British  troops left in Berlin, which they are due to quit by the end of September.
This last military parade by the British troops in Berlin was staged as  the official Queens Birthday Parade, and the bands had twice played "God Save  the Queen" by the time the sunshine gave way to a heavy shower of rain.
The ceremony was concluded with volleys of rifle-fire into the air and an  enthusiastic, inimitably British three cheers of "Hip-Hip-Hooray!" for Queen  Elizabeth II of England as helicopters and light planes flew past overhead.
The parade was one of a series in the allied forces leave-taking from  Berlin.
The French forces said their farewell in March, on June 18 the western  allies stage a joint parade, the Russians get their send-off on August 31 and  the western allies hold a grand finale September 8 and 9.
