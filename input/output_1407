A top-level federal commission on the homeless  unveiled a plan Monday for giving temporary assistance to people living on the  streets and then helping them find permanent homes.
In a 100-page report by the Inter-Agency Task Force on the Homeless, the  panel suggested that the homeless be given short-term emergency shelter,  shunted to transitional housing during job training or other counseling and  then helped to find permanent, affordable housing.
The proposal has not yet been approved by President Bill Clinton.
The plan splits the homeless into two groups: those who lost their homes  because of disabling problems such as alcoholism and those who were poor but  had homes until a sudden event, such as a fire or loss of a job.
The report put the homeless population at seven million, with 600,000  sleeping on the streets on any given night.
"It is important we commit ourselves to numbers and timetables," said  Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros, who chaired the panel. "In the past the  federal government has avoided speaking to numbers. This is a dangerous game.  We're willing to say that's the number we need to work with, or we can't begin  to forge a meaningful policy."
