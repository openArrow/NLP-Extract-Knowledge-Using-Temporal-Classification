Engineers of state-run Indian Airlines called  off a crippling 10-day protest Wednesday after management hiked their wages by  45 percent, officials said.
The All India Aircraft Engineers Association signed an agreement after 18  hours of talks spread over three days. The deal will cost the airline some  900,000 dollars annually, the officials said.
"The agreement will go a long way in establishing good industrial  relations" in Indian Airlines, association general secretary J.S. Chabra said.
The union's nearly 700 members shortened their working hours as part of a  "go slow" campaign to win wage hikes that forced the airline to cancel at  least 115 flights and lose some 330,000 dollars in revenue.
The number of passengers flying daily with Indian Airlines fell from  24,000 to 6,000. Thousands of passengers were stranded all over the country  and turned in desperation to new private carriers.
Indian Airlines is among the world's largest regional networks. But  inefficiency and frequent labour unrest have seen clients switch loyalty to  private airlines.
