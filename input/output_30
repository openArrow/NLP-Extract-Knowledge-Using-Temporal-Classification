"We want a little May madness of our own," Indiana guard Reggie Miller  said. "We know this is a big time at the speedway, but I would like to see  some of the drivers at our game."
Miller might have to wait until Sunday, after most of the top racers have  made the field. But he vows to support any drivers who support the Pacers.
"I want to see Emmo Fittipaldi, Raul Boesel, Mario and Michael Andretti  and the rest cheering for us," Miller said. "I've never been to the speedway,  but if they come, I will go there. That's a fair trade off."
The NBA-Indy 500 conflict has caused the greatest problem for Indianapolis  media sports coordinator Bill York, who handles press duties for the speedway  as well as the city's NBA and National Football League clubs. He cannot be in  two places at once, so the 60-year-old manager will handle first-day speedway  duties and rejoin the Pacers on Sunday.
"It's too involved out here on Saturday with everybody qualifying," York  said. "It's a shame to have to miss one or the other."
Reports said Clinton feels the same way. Rumors have him scheduled to  attend at least part of the Pacers' game and 500 time trials. He is here for a  political meeting and to dedicate a memorial to Bobby Kennedy.
Clinton attended the US college basketball finals because his home-state  Arkansas Razorbacks were involved.
