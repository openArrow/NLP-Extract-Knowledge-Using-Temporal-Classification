President Suharto welcomed Tuesday Philippine  President Fidel Ramos's move to ban foreigners from participating in a  conference on East Timor in Manila scheduled for later this month.
"President Suharto appreciates the decision taken by President Ramos,"  foreign Minister Ali Alatas announced after meeting with Suharto, adding that  the ban "indicates that the two countries' ties are much more important than  that conference."
Alatas added that the conference, planned for May 31-June 3 and organized  privately by non-governmental organizations, "has a political aim and (is)  aimed at attacking Indonesia."
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was occupied by Indonesian troops  in 1975 and annexed by Jakarta as its 27th province the following year. The  annexation is not recognized by the United Nations.
