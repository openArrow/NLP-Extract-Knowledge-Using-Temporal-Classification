The southern-based Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) plans  to create a state of South Yemen, a reliable source said here Friday, as civil  war split the country less than four years after reunification.
"The decision has been taken and the announcement will probably come  quickly," the source told AFP.
The socialists, lead by vice-president Ali Salem al-Baid, held a  succession of meetings Friday over plans to set up a government for the  southern half of Yemen which only united with the north in 1990.
For the past three weeks, north and south Yemeni have been fighting a  civil war and on Friday northern forces in Sanaa claimed to have made further  progress in advancing on Aden, after Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Saleh, a  northerner, ignored appeals for a ceasefire during the Moslem feast of Al-Adha.
Al-Baid is expected to return to Aden shortly after visiting the eastern  Yemeni province of Hadramout to win its support for the southern state.
The Yemeni opposition, including a number of northern-based groups,  rallied to Al-Baid a few days ago but appeared split Friday over whether to  support the creation of a separate state.
One member of the opposition bloc, Omar al-Gaoui, general secretary of the  Yemeni Unionist Rally, told AFP the decision the socialists were preparing to  take was "very dangerous."
