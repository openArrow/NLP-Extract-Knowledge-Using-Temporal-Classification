A flare-up of violence in South  Africa's Zulu province of KwaZulu-Natal claimed 21 lives at the weekend, while  six people were killed in Johannesburg, police said.
Most of the murders were common-law crimes rather than political killings,  police said.
But the most serious incident occurred at Ndedwe, a traditional scene of  conflict between ANC and Zulu Inkatha supporters north of Durban, where a  score of men armed with automatic weapons gunned down four people and spread  terror Saturday across a sugar-cane plantation.
In Johannesburg, six people died and six people were wounded in an attack  on a taxi rank, part of an ongoing "taxi war" between rival companies for  custom, police added.
Political violence, which has claimed thousands of lives in South Africa,  has abated since last month's first all-race general elections brought the  African National Congress (ANC) to power.
The Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party won control of its traditional  stronghold in KwaZulu-Natal.
