In 33 years of racing, Emerson  Fittipaldi has never had an engine this good.
The reigning Indianapolis 500 champion gave the Mercedes power plant his  ultimate praise here Thursday after driving his Penske car to the month's  fastest lap in practice for the 78th Indy race.
The Brazilian circled the 2.5-mile (4 km) oval in 39.05 seconds at 230.438  mph (368.700 km/h). Fittipaldi reached a top speed of 245 mph (392 km/h).
"I've never been 245 mph before in my life," Fittipaldi said. "This is the  limit. Oh my. That must be a lot in kilometers. I don't want to even see it in  kilometers. I'll keep it in miles."
Fittipaldi's top speed replaced another Brazilian driver, Raul Boesel,  atop the Indy practice speed list. Boesel's best was 230.403 mph (368.644  km/h).
"We seem to be running in the same time slot more than anybody other than  the Penskes," Boesel said. "We have been consistent and we have a good balance  on the car."
Fittipaldi and his Mercedes-powered Roger Penske teammates, Al Unser Jnr  and Canada's Paul Tracy, are favorites in Saturday's 100,000-dollar pole  battle for the May 29 race. Fittipaldi won his only Indy pole in 1990, one  year after taking his first checkered flag at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
The Mercedes engine, designed by English motormakers Mario Illien and Paul  Morgan, takes advantage of extra boost allowed stock block engines. The rule  was aimed at allowing low-budget teams to be competitive here, but Penske's  multi million-dollar investment in an engine legal only here has made his cars  the ones to beat.
"The reality is there is much less of an advantage than people think,"  Fittipaldi said.
