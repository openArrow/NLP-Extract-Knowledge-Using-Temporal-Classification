Pierce scored her second devastating win of the week when she crushed  Italy's Maria Francesca Bentivoglio 6-0, 6-1 in just 56 minutes.
Her latest win comes hard on the heels of her overwhelming first-round  dismissal of experienced Australian Nicole Provis. In that match the 6ft  Pierce also conceded only one game.
Pierce put her new-found confidence down to the influence of her new coach  Nick Bollettieri.
"He has made me work hard. But now I feel really fit and that gives me a  lot of confidence," she said.
Pierce now plays American Lori McNeil who defeated Kristie Boogert of the  Netherlands in three sets.
In the men's singles fourth-seeded Ukranian Andrei Medvedev dropped a set  but beat Sweden's former world junior champion Nicklas Kulti 6-4, 7-6 (7/4),  4-6, 7-5.
He now plays Canada's Greg Rusedski who chalked up a surprise 7-5, 6-3,  2-6, 6-3 win over Russian Alexander Volkov.
