South Korea put its entire armed forces and police  on "heightened" alert Tuesday on the eve of President Kim Young-Sam's  departure for a week-long state visit to Russia, military authorities said.
"All troops have been ordered to heighten vigilance and intensify  surveillance of North Korea's military movements," a Defense Ministry  spokesman told AFP.
The alert coincided with a UN Security Council statement urging North  Korea to allow full international inspection of its nuclear sites, but  military officials here said the South's alert status was directly linked to  Kim's overseas trip.
"It was not linked to any abnormal military movement in North Korea but to  Kim's trip," the spokesman said.
He noted the status of heightened combat readiness had been maintained  since last November, when the standoff over North Korea's nuclear program  began worsening.
A similar alert was put into effect in late March when Kim travelled to  Japan and China. In response, North Korea raised its military alert status,  heightening tension along the border during Kim's week-long absence.
More than 1.5 million South and North Korea soldiers are stationed close  to the border, which has been heavily fortified since the devastating 1950-53  Korean conflict.
During Kim's trip, South Korean field commanders from generals to platoon  officers will stay within reach of military communications networks 24 hours a  day.
Police said they would also remain prepared for emergencies during Kim's  absence.
