About 50 would-be illegal immigrants drowned  overnight in a shipwreck off the Gabonese coast near Cape Esterias as they  sought to make their way into the country, police said Tuesday.
Paramilitary police and firemen went Tuesday to rescue survivors from the  disaster, who were thought to be of West African origin, but the precise  number and nationalities of the victims was not clear.
Early in February, 67 illegal immigrants, mainly Ghanaians and Nigerians,  died in their crowded cell at a paramilitary police base in Libreville,  sparking an international protest and a Gabonese government enquiry.
People from other West African countries are attracted by the relative  prosperity of Gabon, which until last year had the highest income per head in  the region. The minimum wage is still higher than in other countries.
For clandestine travellers, the sea trip is the most perilous part of the  journey. They travel in pirogues, generally owned by Nigerians, which can  carry up to 80 people.
The voyage from Nigeria to Gabon takes five or six days, with port calls  in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, where the ferrymen engage in more or less  shady trading activities.
It is not uncommon for the boats to be caught in storms and shipwrecks are  frequent in the Gulf of Guinea.
Already weakened by the journey and by the lack of food, according to some  survivors, the hopeful immigrants sometimes find themselves at the mercy of  unscrupulous smugglers.
One oft-used trick is deliberately to ground the pirogue on a bank not far  offshore, where the ferrymen rob their charges of their luggage. Some of the  passengers are themselves smugglers, carrying objects of value.
Over the years, the growth of illegal immigration and smuggling has led to  the founding of illegal ports, tucked away on isolated shores or islands,  particularly in Equatorial Guinea.
