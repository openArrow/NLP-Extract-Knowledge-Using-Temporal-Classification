England's South African tour was in  disarray here on Saturday after its full-strength Test line-up was thrashed  21-6 by Natal at King's Park.
England, whose second string lost their tour opener against Orange Free  State in midweek, were desperate to restore morale, so much so that skipper  Will Carling said he was taking the match as seriously as a Test.
But fly-half Rob Andrew had a dreadful day with the boot, missing seven  out of nine kicks at goal as Super 10 finalists Natal ran away with the match.
The result will give new coach Jack Rowell a major headache before the  two-Test series.
England, playing open and enterprising rugby, were unlucky to reach the  turn 9-3 down.
But Springbok Test fly-half Henry Honiball taught Andrew a lesson, with an  immaculate display of touch kicking and three penalties.
Andre Joubert, the Natal full-back, added nine more points from four  attempts to settle the match.
England spent the last 10 minutes in all-out attack, but were brought down  short of the line on several occasions.
The tourists' worries continued when first-choice full-back David Pears,  who went into the match with a slight hamstring strain, had to be replaced by  Stuart Barnes in the second half.
