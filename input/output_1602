Share prices were sharply higher in London and  Paris in moderate early trading on Wednesday, underpinned by an overnight  rally on Wall Street after the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates,  dealers said.
The US central bank raised the overnight interbank rate half a percentage  point from 3.75 percent to 4.25 percent and its discount rate from 3.0 to 3.5  percent.
Dealers said the new interest rates ended uncertainty about the near-term  direction of US rates and were perceived as potentially the last rises for  several months.
By midmorning, the FT-SE 100 index had risen 20.4 points to 3,143.9 pence  -- a rise of 0.6 percent, after opening 32 points higher. In Paris, the CAC-40  index rose 0.57 percent to 2,207.79 points, after lifting 0.77 percent on  opening.
But remaining hopes of a cut in British interest rates were dashed after a  batch of British statistics showed unemployment fell 36,800 in April,  inflation rose to 2.6 percent, and public sector borrowing fell to show a 4.35  billion pound deficit.
Prices in Britain were accordingly down off early highs, but remained  supported by Wall Street.
Elsewhere, dealers said a Bundesbank cut in its securities repurchasing  agreement (repo) pension by 0.12 points to 5.23 percent had no effect on the  market.
British Gas was up 1.5 pence at 283 on news of the sale of its 53 percent  interest in Bow Valley Energy for around 720 million Canadian dollars and  ahead of its first quarter results on Thursday.
National Power, Britain's largest electricity distributor, rose four pence  to 441 after full-year results showed a 17 percent increase and sharply  increased total dividend payents.
Bass, which announced a six percent rise in half-yearly pre-tax profits at  242 million pounds, rose seven pence to 550.
The day before its annual results, BT lifted four pence to 380.5.
But Eurotunnel fell five pence to 400 on fears of a larger-than-expected  increase in capital.
In Paris, shares were sharply higher on the US Federal Reserve move and  the futures market rose one percent.
Dealers said the Fed's rate hikes "will give us a couple of months'  clearance" and could signal a switch of investor attention back to domestic  issues.
Interest rate sensitive stocks were among the main gainers on expectations  that French interest rates have room to decline further, dealers said.
Axa was up 28 French francs at 1.410, while Sefimeg lifted 3.6 percent,  Cetelem rose 3.5 percent, and Compagnie Bancaire was 2.4 percent higher.
But Immeubles de France fell 3.8 percent, Bertrand Faure lost three  pecent, Lagardere Groupe was down three percent as was Essilor ADP.
