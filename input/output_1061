The United States may soon put Pakistan on the  list of countries it deems to be backing international terrorism, State  Department spokesman Michael McCurry said Monday.
"The activity that we are aware of in support of Kashmiri militants is  something that we monitor, and if that were in the category of repeated  instances of state sponsorship of terrorism, that could lead to a different  determination" on the status of US policy toward Pakistan, the spokesman said.
The Pakistani "government is aware that any state supporting terrorism  might be put on the list," which would result in restrictions on bilateral  diplomatic and trade ties, he said.
But McCurry added that "that is not an active question before the  secretary" of state, Warren Christopher, until such time as Washington  determines "what level of support (may be) being provided to Kashmiri  militants."
Iran and Syria have been on the list for years. Pakistan however long has  been a US ally in the region, particularly since the war in Afghanistan in the  1980's.
