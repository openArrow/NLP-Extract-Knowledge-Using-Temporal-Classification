The Middle East peace talks have failed to live up  to expectations since they began three years ago, Lebanese Foreign Minister  Fares Bweiz said in remarks published here on Monday.
Bweiz told the official Jordanian press agency Petra when he arrived here  late Sunday that "three years after the peace process was launched in Madrid  it has not fulfilled the hopes" of the parties involved.
But he said the co-sponsors of the October 1991 Madrid peace conference,  Russia and the United States, must "continue to play an effective role as a  fair mediator."
Bweiz added Syria, Lebanon and Jordan were committed to co-ordinating  their efforts to reach a peace agreement with Israel.
The three countries criticised the PLO when it struck a secret deal with  Israel in talks in Oslo last year without informing other Arab countries of  the moves.
The secret talks resulted in the accord lauching Palestinian self-rule in  the Gaza Strip and Jericho signed on May 4 in Cairo.
But Arab-Israeli peace talks have remained stalled since the killing of 30  Arabs in a Hebron mosque in February, and despite renewed efforts by US  Secretary of State Warren Christopher to bring Israel and Syria back to the  negotiating table.
Bweiz was in Amman for the 17th session of the Economic and Social  Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) which opened Sunday.
