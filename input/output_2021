Ministers of the European Union and 70 associated  African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) developing nations continued confidential  discussions here on Thursday in a mid-term review of their trade and aid pact  known as the Lome Convention.
The three-day parley in the Swaziland capital is due to adapt the  convention to recent international developments. The emphasis is on making a  more direct link between aid and respect for human rights encompassing  "democratic values, the rule of law and good govern ance," as EU proposals put  it. The EU is looking for explicit language about suspending aid if such  values are infringed.
The ACP countries are urging an effective mechanism for the resolution of  disputes arising from any perceived contravention of the human rights  provisions.
Current ACP chairman George Brizan of Grenada affirmed: "The ACP states  have already committed themselves unequivocally to respect for human rights  and the promotion of democracy, the rule of law and good governance in their  respective countries."
He added: "The ACP group urges support of these processes of change  through instruments of encouragement rather than exclusion or penalties."
