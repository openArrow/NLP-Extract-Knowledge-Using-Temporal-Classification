If Samantha's bid for the money is successful, her bid for life will start  next week in what Winn Stanley described as "a large mansion with three suites  with up to two patients in each suite."
Winn Stanley said that, initially, Samantha would need around-the-clock  care during which she would be hand-fed by two professional carers.
"There is no force-feeding, there are no tubes," insisted Winn Stanley.
Stage two, once the patient has returned to a pattern of fairly normal  eating, is therapy, said Winn Stanley.
"It's intensive," she said. "It's a very supporting environment."
Samantha's problems began 13 years ago when she and her twin sister,  Michaela, made a "slimming pact" when they were sick of being teased at school  for being overweight.
But nearly four weeks ago, Michaela died -- suffering from anorexia  nervosa, the so-called dieter's disease. Michaela weighed just 25 kilos (56  pounds) when she died.
A shocked Samantha appeared on British television this week admitting: "I  don't know how much time I have left because the dieting has done so much to  my body."
Appearing emaciated and cadaver-like, Samantha told another reporter in a  separate interview: "My bones are sticking out so much now that it's too  painful to even lie in the bath."
The girls' mother said the twins each weighed 82 kilos (182 pounds) when  as 14-year-olds they made their pact which would prove so deadly.
Despite massive drops in weight, psychiatric counselling and hospital  treatment, the girls continued their death diet into adulthood.
