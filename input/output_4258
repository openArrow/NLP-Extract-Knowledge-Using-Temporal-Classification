South African police Thursday posted a 100,000  rand (170,000 dollar) reward for information leading to the arrest of a  right-winger wanted in connection with an arms robbery at an air base.
Mathys de Villiers, 29, is alleged to have master-minded the robbery of  155 weapons, including heavy machine guns, assault rifles and laser-equipped  handguns, from an air base at Pretoria over a weekend in early March.
Two other break-in attempts at the base, one in March, one two weeks ago,  failed.
De Villiers "is a member of an extreme right-wing organisation and has had  specialist training in the defence force," police said.
The air force said the weapons were probably intended "for use in terror  attacks by the right wing," but that these were forestalled by a police sweep  against activists.
Police arrested 32 members of the neo-nazi AWB Afrikaner Resistance Group  following a series of bomb attacks, just ahead of the April all-race  elections, in which 21 people were killed and 150 wounded.
A 33rd person was arrested on Wednesday.
The 32 arrested earlier have been released on bail and amnesty for them  might be the subject of discussions scheduled for Monday between President  Nelson Mandela and AWB leader Eugene Terre-Blanche.
The meeting was announced by Mandela on Wednesday after Terre-Blanche said  he had made the amnesty question a precondition to any talks.
Mandela did not comment on the amnesty call, but said the new government  had to show "flexibility" if it wanted to foster reconciliation in South  Africa.
