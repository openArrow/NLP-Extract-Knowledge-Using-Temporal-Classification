Refugees in Croatia are being refused burial rights  in Zagreb cemeteries and may only be cremated, the Helsinki-based Human Rights  Committee said Saturday.
The committee said the ruling, which it condemned as a "gross violation of  human and religious rights," had been made by municipal authorities in Zagreb  last autumn.
The organisation deplored that "those who have lost everything see  themselves deprived of two square metres of Croat land for their last resting  place."
Cemetery authorities confirmed the policy, which they attributed to a  shortage of funeral grants, and said in a statement people that refugees and  displaced persons could be buried at Velika Gorica cemetery in a Zagreb suburb  for a fee of 670 German marks (some 400 dollars).
More than 500,000 refugees have fled to Croatia, most of them from  Bosnia-Herzegovina.
