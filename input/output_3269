Zubizarreta confirmed his departure, saying: "I'm leaving with my head  held high. I gave everything to Barcelona and I'm proud of what I've done for  the club."
But he refused to criticise the Spanish champions' manager Johan Cruyff or  the club, arguing: "The club is bigger than all of us. You won't get a word of  criticism out of me."
