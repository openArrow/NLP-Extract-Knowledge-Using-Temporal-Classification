Norman Schwarzkopf, the retired general who  commanded US forces in the Gulf War, had prostate cancer surgery Wednesday in  a Washington hospital.
"All indications are that the cancer was discovered in its early stages  and the prospects are for a full recovery," said a statement from the Walter  Reed Army Medical Center.
Schwarzkopf's doctor also said that the 59-year-old general was in  excellent physical condition and could recover in a few weeks.
Cancer of the prostate, a gland at the base of the bladder, is one of the  most common forms of cancer afflicting men.
