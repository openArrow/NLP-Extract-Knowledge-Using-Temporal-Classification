A state bank is to open a new branch in  northeastern Iran to cater exclusively for women, as part of moves to  segregate the sexes according to Islamic principles, a newspaper reported  Tuesday.
The "experimental" branch of the Saderat bank, to be opened soon in the  city of Mashhad, will be entirely staffed by women and provides services to  female customers only.
Since the 1979 Islamic revolution, Iran has launched several plans to  segregate men from women in public offices.
