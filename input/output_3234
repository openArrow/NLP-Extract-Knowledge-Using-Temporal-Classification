Former Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega fought  off a reformist challenge Monday to be renamed as secretary general of the  opposition Sandinista party.
Ortega, president from 1979-1990, heads the traditionalist wing of the  leftist Sandanista National Liberation Front.
He was re-elected as secretary general for a three year period, defeating  Henry Ruiz the leader of the reformist wing of the party.
Ortega was defeated for the presidency by Violetta Chamorro in elections  held in 1990.
