The European Space Agency said Monday it had chosen  German astronaut Ulf Merbold for a European-Russian mission, EUROMIR 94, which  will be effected in October.
The agency's European flight chief, Belgium's Walter Peeters, said it had  chosen between Merbold and the Spaniard Pedro Duque after consultation with  its Russian partners.
As Merbold had already worked with the US space authorities, it would be  possible to "make comparisons," he told a press conference at the Berlin  airshow.
Merbold, 53, took part in two US space shuttle missions in 1983 and 1992.  He has worked for the European Space Agency since 1977 and began training at  the Moscow centre for cosmonauts in 1993.
The trio will take part in EUROMIR 94, which is to be effected October 3.  They will include a Russian woman scheduled to stay in space for 90 days. The  longest a woman has stayed in space so far is 30 days.
The mission will allow the European agency to experiment with extended  stays in space, as Merbold will be on board the MIR station 30 days. European  astronauts have stayed aboard it for some 10 days only so far.
