Khmer Rouge nominal leader Khieu Samphan has  agreed to attend peace talks with the Cambodian government in Pyongyang later  this month, an official statement from the rebel group said Friday.
"I would like to tell his majesty the king that I am very happy to  participate in the round table peace talks for national reconciliation and  peace in Cambodia that begin on May 27," Khieu Samphan said in the statement.
The statement -- released by the Royal Palace -- was addressed to King  Norodom Sihanouk, who had appealed to Khieu Samphan on Wednesday to "reply  clearly and precisely" to the king's peace proposals.
Co-premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen had agreed Wednesday to  go to Pyongyang on May 27 for peace talks with the Khmer Rouge, dropping  preconditions for a ceasefire, after an appeal by King Sihanouk.
Prince Ranariddh said the government agreed to drop the ceasefire  precondition for the talks -- also to be attended by National Assembly  chairman Chea Sim -- because the condition had deadlocked the peace process in  Cambodia.
Hun Sen, who has been strongly opposed to making concessions to the Khmer  Rouge, said the talks would be based on a five-point peace plan put forward by  the king.
The plan includes giving certain "acceptable" members of the Khmer Rouge  senior cabinet posts in exchange for giving up their control zones, ceasing  all guerrilla activities and merging rebel fighters with the royal armed  forces.
