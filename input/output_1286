China's largest city, Shanghai, posted record  exports in the first four months of 1994, despite a drop in industrial output  sparked by the rising cost of raw materials and capital shortfalls, Xinhua  said Tuesday.
Shanghai, often considered an economic barometer for the rest of the  country, exported a record 2.46 billion dollars through January-April, up 26.6  percent from the same period last year, the official news agency said.
Although industrial output, which accounts for 60 percent of the eastern  city's gross domestic product (GDP), slipped at the beginning of the year, it  recovered last month to post a 16 percent increase over April 1992.
Overseas investors showed continued interest in Shanghai, with the  municipal authorities approving 1,256 foreign-funded projects with a combined  investment of 2.89 billion dollars in the first four months.
However, a local government official said significant economic problems  remained, citing loss-making state enterprises, price hikes of raw materials  and the unification of China's dual exchange rate at the beginning of the  year.
"These have resulted in a rise in production costs and hurt the  enterprises badly," said the official, who also pointed to other negative  factors such as a shortage of funds, inflation and sluggish markets.
Shanghai's GDP increased 13 percent in 1993 and the municipal authorities  have set a target of 15 percent growth this year.
Meanwhile, customs figures released Tuesday showed that China suffered a  trade deficit of 1.75 billion dollars in the first four months of the year,  but the volume of exports grew faster than that of imports.
The total volume of trade hit 57.84 billion dollars, up 21 percent on the  same period last year, with exports surging 22 percent to 28.04 billion  dollars and imports rising 20.3 percent to 29.79 billion dollars, the China  Daily quoted General Administration of Customs officials as saying.
