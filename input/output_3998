English Premiership club Chelsea paid a club record  2.3 million pounds on Wednesday for Watford striker Paul Furlong.
Furlong, 25, who has also played for Coventry City, will compete with John  Spencer, Mark Stein and Neil Shipperley for a place in the Stamford Bridge  line-up.
The beaten FA Cup finalists' previous most expensive buy was 2.1 million  pound Robert Fleck from Norwich City in August 1992.
