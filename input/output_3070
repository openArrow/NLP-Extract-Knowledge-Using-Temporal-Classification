Downer, a young looking 42, was educated at the exclusive Geelong Grammar  school near Melbourne where the Prince of Wales was also a student.
Later he spent 11 years in Britain. Downer earned an honours degree in  economics at Newcastle University and developed a plummy English accent which  was a distinct handicap in the rough and tumble of Australian politics until  he started to modify it recently.
Married and with three daughters and a son, Downer worked as a bank  economist and as speechwriter for Australia's last conservative prime  minister, Malcolm Fraser, who was in office from 1975 to 1983.
Downer served as a diplomat between 1976 and 1982 as a member of the  Australian Mission to the European Community in Brussels and at the Australian  embassy in Belgium.
He has held a range of shadow portfolios, including arts, environment,  small business, trade, defence and most recently the treasury.
