North Korea has resumed removal of fuel  rods at a nuclear site after talks failed on efforts to have the procedure  monitored by international experts, the International Atomic Energy Agency  said Friday.
In a letter to UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, IAEA director  general Hans Blix said the action could prevent inspectors from determining  whether nuclear fuel was being diverted for weapons.
