Warm and windy conditions thwarted  Emerson Fiittpaldi's bid to take the Indianapolis 500 pole position from  teammate Al Unser Jnr, leaving him a front-row consolation spot beside fellow  Brazilian Raul Boesel.
Fittipaldi's four-lap qualifying run here Sunday was 227.303 mph (363.684  km/h), well off the 228.011 mph (364.817 km/h) standard set by Unser in  Saturday's rain-shortened session over the 2.5-mile (4km) oval.
"We were lucky the weather was hot, humid and windy," Unser said. "If the  weather had been like Saturday, Emerson would have outrun us."
Both racers use the new Mercedes-Benz engine that has dominated speeds in  its first appearance here in 71 years. The German-backed motor takes advantage  of an Indy-only rule allowing extra boost over conventional designs.
Retiring Mario Andretti qualified for his 29th Indy race Sunday, joining  Fittipaldi and seven others in the field for the May 29 race. The group  included Italy's Teo Fabi, Sweden's Stefan Johansson, Canada's Paul Tracy and  Mexico's Adrian Fernandez.
Fittipaldi will start from the outside of row one, the same spot he won  from here in 1989. The former Formula One and Indy series champion bumped  Canadian rookie Jacques Villenueve into the second row for the May 29 race.
"I was worried to even make the front row. I was concerned about beating  Villeneuve," Fittipaldi said. "It was much harder than Saturday. The wind was  blowing harder. After the first lap, I knew I could not do it. There was more  push and I had to back off on the second and third laps."
Andretti felt the wind as well but qualified ninth with an average of  223.503 mph (357.604 km/h).
