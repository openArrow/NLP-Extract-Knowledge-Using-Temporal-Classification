UN envoy Yasushi Akashi has invited the warring  parties in Bosnia-Hercegovina to negotiate a comprehensive cessation of  hostilities at a meeting in Geneva next week, the UN Protection Force  announced Saturday.
The co-chairmen of the peace conference in the former Yugoslavia, Lord  Owen of the European Union and Thorvald Stoltenberg of the United Nations, as  well as US special envoy Charles Redman and his Russian counterpart Vitaly  Churkin, were also invited, an UNPROFOR statement said.
Akashi will be accompanied at the Geneva meeting, to be held Thursday and  Friday, by UNPROFOR commander for ex-Yugoslavia Lieutenant-General Bertrand de  Lapresle, and the UNPROFOR commander in Bosnia-Hercegovina, Lieutenant-General  Sir Michael Rose, the statement added.
Akashi, in letters sent to Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Bosnian  Serb leader Radovan Karadzic on Friday, "drew attention to the presidential  statement adopted by the UN Security Council on 25 May 1994 in which the  Council reaffirmed the urgent need for a comprehensive cessation of  hostilities throughout the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and  Hercegovina."
Next week's meeting aims to build on Akashi's May 21 initiative "putting  forward a framework for an immediate cessation of hostilities between the  parties, including provision for the disengagement of forces and the  interpositioning of UNPROFOR troops between the forces."
The announcement comes after France hosted two-day talks between the  so-called contact group on Bosnia-Hercegovina -- the European Union, Russia  and the United States -- and Bosnian Croats, Moslems and Serbs Wednesday and  Thursday in the Alpine hideaway of Talloires, not far from Geneva.
The session reached no apparent agreement, but another round was scheduled  in the French resort town on June 6 and 7.
The contact group negotiators tried in vain to get the factions to agree  to a four-month ceasefire and to accept a European plan for partition that  would give 51 percent of territory to a Croat-Moslem federation and 49 percent  to the Serbs.
