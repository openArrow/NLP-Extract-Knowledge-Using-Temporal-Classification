Earlier Arantxa Sanchez got up unhurt from a spectacular fall and moved  closer to recapturing the title she first won as a 17-year-old in 1989 by  beating Germany's Anke Huber.
"I was really worried when I rolled over and my arm was pinned behind  me," said the 22-year-old Spaniard, adding: "But when I was able to pick up my  racket I knew everything would be all right."
The centre-court spill came in the seventh game of the second-set as  Sanchez charged through 6-3, 6-2.
From the start the Barcelona battler went about her business with  ferocious efficiency and never allowed the 24-year-old German to settle.
Sanchez, who is one of only two players to beat world number-one Steffi  Graf in the last twelve months, was clearly delighted with her game on her  favourite surface.
She has conceded only 17 games since launching her eighth campaign in the  French capital last Monday, but she is counting no chickens.
"I take it one match at a time," she said. "Anything can happen. But I am  pleased with the way I am playing and I am confident."
Sanchez, who has had three tournament wins in 1994 and who was runner-up  to Graf at the Australian Open and at Delray Beach, now faces Julie Halard.
The 23-year-old French girl, who has risen to 24th in the world rankings  after an excellent season, scored a superb 7-6 (7/2), 7-5 win over  seventh-seed Natalia Zvereva.
Cheered on by the partisan fans packed into the Stadium's new 'A'  showcourt, Halard refused to be intimidated by either her Belarus opponent or  the occasion.
The winner of this year's Taranto tournament and runner-up at the Paris  Indoor Open went for her shots and often left Zvereva, the 1988 finalist,  gasping.
