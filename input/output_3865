The Commission of the European Union has decided  to investigate a plan by the French government to inject 20 billion francs  (3.5 billion dollars) into the Air France airline, an EU spokesman said on  Wednesday.
The enquiry is a normal procedure under European treaties to ensure that  state aid does not interfere unfairly with competition between companies in  different countries of the union.
Air France is in severe financial difficulties. The commission recently  instructed France to give foreign airlines access to Orly airport south of  Paris, effectively opening the French domestic market to competition.
Air France, and its domestic subsidiary Air Inter, saw this as adding to  their commercial problems.
The commission said that it wanted to be sure that aid for the  restructuring of Air France would have the expected effect on the company and  on the whole group and that the size of the recapitalisation was not  disproportinate in relation to the problem, the spokesman said.
At the beginning of March Air France had put forward a recapitalisation  plan requiring the state to provide 20 billion francs. Under the plan the  company would shed 5,000 jobs without redundancies. The new capital would be  provided in three portions over three years.
Air France, which made a loss of 8.48 billion francs (1.5 billion dollars)  in 1993, has said that it plans to freeze pay for three years, to reduce the  number of airliners it operates and to reduce its purchasing programme.
The French government put this plan before the commission in March. The  commission, following the standard procedure, has now decided to open an  enquiry to be sure that the aid is compatible with EU law.
The commission wanted to be sure that the aid would be the last to be  received by the company and would not be used to acquire shares in other EU  airlines, the commission said.
The aid must not disrupt the market on routes on which companies in the  Air France group competed with other European airliners, it said.
The commission hoped to reach a conclusion before the summer holidays  because it was conscious of the urgency of the case.
The aid could not be paid until the investigation had been competed, the  spokesman said.
The commission is already probing Air France, under an enquiry begun in  November, in connection with the issue of shares to raise 1.5 billion francs  (265 million dollars) which were underwritten by the French state-controlled  deposit organisation the Caisse des Depots et Consignations Francaise.
In Paris on Wednesday the government approved a bill which would enable  the state to issue shares in Air France to employees who agreed that their pay  be frozen for three years.
