The president of the French Schneider engineering  group Didier Pineau-Valencienne was charged and jailed for fraud here Friday,  judicial sources said.
Earlier in Paris, Schneider had obtained the suspension of its shares,  saying that Pineau-Valencienne was accused of forgery, using false documents,  fraud, false accounting and breach of confidence.
The company denied the allegations.
The investigating magistrate had issued an arrest warrant which under  Belgian law is equivalent to temporary detention. The detention order is  reviewed after five days and then monthly.
In Paris sources close to the company said that Pineau-Valencienne had  gone to Brussels of his own volition on Thursday to answers questions from the  financial investigators.
He had answered their questions for nine hours until 7:00 p.m. local time  and had then given evidence to the investigating magistrate from 11:00 p.m.   until 5:30 a.m. on Friday.
He had been charged and taken into custody at dawn and would be held for  five days, sources close to the case said.
Earlier in Paris, Schneider had said that management and staff were  "profoundly indignant and stupefied" by the accusations and gave their  president their full support.
The charges arose out of a complaint by minority shareholders in two of  the company's financial subsidiaries in Belgium, Cofimines and Cofibel.
Schneider said that Pineau-Valencienne was accused of having managed the  financial subsidiaries to the detriment of minority shareholders. It rejected  the charges.
The group had "always acted out of respect for the interests of all  shareholders in these companies, including when bids for these companies were  made in 1992".
The suspension in trading of shares was lifted in the early afternoon  after which the price of shares fell by 6.12 percent to 388 francs.
