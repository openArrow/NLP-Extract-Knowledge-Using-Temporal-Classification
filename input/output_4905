Thai and United Nations officials Saturday  continued to scour the border with Cambodia for two missing Belgians, one of  them a UN employee, but a Thai officer said they still had no clue to their  whereabouts.
Heavy rain continued to hamper the search, said a member of the military's  Suranari task force reached by telephone from Bangkok.
The search for Michel Baran, 31, a minerals expert for the Bangkok-based  UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), and his  girlfriend, Nathalie Roobaert, 21, has been underway since Tuesday, when their  car was found abandoned near Preah Vihear temple.
Preah Vihear is a popular tourist site and the couple is thought to have  visited the 1,000-year-old shrine just across the border in extreme northeast  Cambodia, opposite Thailand's Sisaket province, some 570 kilometers (350  miles) east of Bangkok.
