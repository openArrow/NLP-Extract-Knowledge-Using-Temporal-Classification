higher then lower. The price of gold climbed to 387.75 dollars per  ounce -- a closing high since the end of March.
With a slight delay, the London market followed New York, where prices  rose sharply last Friday. Gold also lifted as commodities across the board  soared.
The continued weakness of the dollar provoked investors into speculation  in the precious metals market, where prices remained at a high level for a  good part of the week, reaching 338.15 dollars per ounce on Wednesday.
Gold finished the week lower as commodity prices ebbed generally.
Elsewhere, the quarterly report from the World Gold Council showed  positive results for the first quarter with strong demand from Asia and higher  prices compared to the same period a year earlier.
SILVER: sharply higher then lower. Exactly two months after US investment  funds raided the market, silver was again pushed higher on a new wave of  speculation, with prices rising to 5.79 dollars per ounce.
But, like the other commodities, silver then fell back, despite analysts'  estimates that a deficit in world production should boost prices.
PLATINUM: higher then lower. Like the other precious metals, platinum rose  sharply higher at the beginning of the week to levels not seen since shortly  before the South African elections, at around 407.5 dollars per ounce.
Prices then gradually diminished, falling to below the 400 dollar mark on  Friday after the wave of speculation had passed. Even in Tokyo, the trading  capital of the world, the tension ebbed away on feeble trading levels.
