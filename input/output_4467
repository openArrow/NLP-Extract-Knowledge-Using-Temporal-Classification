Nobel literature laureate Alexander  Solzhenitsyn arrived back in his native Russia early Friday after 20 years in  exile, a correspondent said.
The author of "The Gulag Archipegalo" and "A Day In The Life Of Ivan  Denisovich" flew into this far eastern Russian city from Anchorage, Alaska, on  a stopover on his way to Vladivostock.
Solzhenitsyn, who has lived the life of a recluse in Vermont, was welcomed  home by Magadan's mayor Nikolai Kartenko, flanked by girls bearing flowers and  traditional bread and salt.
After alighting from the aircraft, he twice touched the ground in what he  said was a tribute to the "hundreds of thousands, even millions" of people who  died in the labour camps for which Magadan served as a processing centre.
Solzhenitsyn spoke briefly with former labour camp prisoners who still  live in Magadan.
He smiled and accepted the gifts they brought him which included a  recording of poetry by a former dissident poet, a picture and other objects.
After a short stop of less than 30 minutes, Solzhenitsyn continued his  flight to Vladivostok.
The former camp inmates said they were sorry Solzhenitsyn had not stayed a  few hours at Magadan so he could have visited the Gulag museum or laid a  wreath at the memorial to the millions of political prisoners jailed in the  Soviet era.
