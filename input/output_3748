The caning of a US teenager in Singapore has  triggered calls from some US legislators for corporal punishment for young  vandals in the United States.
"My goal is to humble these punks early on so we don't seek them later in  court as murderers," California assemblyman Mickey Conroy said Tuesday when he  introduced a bill calling for punishment with a wooden paddle.
Conroy's bill calls for having juveniles convicted of graffiti vandalism  paddled in court by their parents. If the beating is not deemed hard enough,  the judge could order a bailiff to take over.
Two other similar measures -- one in Missouri and another in California --  have also been proposed since Michael Fay, 18, was caned this month after  being convicted in Singapore of spray-painting cars and committing other acts  of vandalism.
The punishment sparked a protest from the White House and some US human  rights groups, but many Americans polled thought it was a good idea and  suggested it might be a way to stem the rising crime rate domestically.
The California assembly's speaker, Willie Brown, opposed the paddling  proposal, saying it was "not appropriate in this democracy."
