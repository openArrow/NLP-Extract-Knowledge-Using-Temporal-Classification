General Motors (GM) laid a complaint  of disloyal management against its former vice president for Europe Hans  Hueskes in Zurich in December, GM said on Wednesday.
GM had laid the complaint "following an internal enquiry involving  telephone tapping, in conformity with Swiss law, and after consultation with  Swiss lawyers", the company said.
It said that it was making the statement in the light of press reports  that the complaint was linked to a long-running dispute between GM and  Volkswagen (VW).
GM has alleged that its former vice president Jose Ignacio Lopez de  Arriortua had committed industrial espionage when he left to take a senior  post at Volkswagen in March 1993.
General Motors had not made the complaint against Hueskes public until  now. It did not detail the nature of its allegations against Hueskes who holds  German nationality.
No-one was available to comment at Opel, which is the German subsidiary of  US-based GM.
Controversy has arisen in Germany over recent revelations that GM had used  private detectives in its investigation of the allegations against Lopez, and  that VW had in turn kept an eye on the detectives.
Lopez and VW have consistently rejected all of the allegations.
