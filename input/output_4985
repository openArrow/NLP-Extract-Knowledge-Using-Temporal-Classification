While America must ensure another D-Day will  never be necessary US military might cannot be used to solve all the world's  problems, said President Bill Clinton Saturday.
"In this era we cannot dispatch our troops to solve every problem," said  Clinton during his weekly radio address.
He warned that although the Cold War had ended, the world still faced  serious problems.
"All of us ... still face serious threats from the spread of nuclear  weapon technology and the spread of other weapons of mass destruction around  the world," said Clinton.
"But we are prepared to defend ourselves and our fundamental interests  when they are threatened," he added.
"We'll do so on our own whenever necessary, and we'll act with others  whenever that's possible and prudent," he explained.
Clinton, who leaves for Europe next week for the 50th anniversary of  D-Day, praised the bravery of the Allied troops who swept up the beaches on  June 6, 1944 to herald the start of the liberation of Europe.
"It was the turning point of World War 11 and in many respects a turning  point of the 20th century
"It was the beginning of the end of Nazi tyranny and a down payment on all  the years of freedom the rest of us have enjoyed ever since," said Clinton.
