Dutch Interior Minister Ed van Thijn resigned  Friday, hours after the resignation of his cabinet colleague Justice Minister  Ernst Hirsch Ballin, the government press office said.
Both have been accused of involvement in a months-long police scandal.
Right and left wing deputies had joined Wednesday in passing a motion of  no confidence in both men.
They were accused of failing to set up safety measures after disbanding an  inter-regional police team in 1993, and Ballin was also blamed for the  disappearance of 36 tonnes of soft drugs from a 40-tonne consignment imported  as "bait" for underworld figures.
