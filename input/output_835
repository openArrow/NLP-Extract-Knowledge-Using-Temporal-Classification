Philippine coconut exports plunged 55.5 percent to  220,900 tonnes in the first quarter due to a typhoon which reduced supplies,  the local industry association said here Monday.
Despite improved prices, coconut export earnings also fell 44.3 percent to  86.6 million dollars, from last year's 155.4 million dollars, the United  Coconut Association of the Philippines said.
A typhoon devastated coconut plantations in the eastern Bicol region, a  primary supplier, late last year.
