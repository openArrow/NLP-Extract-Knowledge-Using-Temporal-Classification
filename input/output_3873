The 1997 Ryder Cup is to be staged at  Valderrama, the club at the centre of inducement allegations by Severiano  Ballesteros.
The Costa del Sol course was, as expected, chosen as the first club  outside Britain to host the match against America by Europe's Ryder Cup  committee here on Wednesday.
Ballesteros, the prospective Ryder Cup captain, had wanted it to go to  Novo Sancti Petri, near Cadiz, but the decision of a committee from which he  resigned three weeks ago will have come as no surprise to anyone.
Valderrama, home of the Volvo Masters since 1988, was favourite ever since  it became the first club to throw its hat into the ring in April 1992.
Ballesteros came up with a multitude of reasons why he did not think it  was suitable, even saying it was "the most elitist club in the world".
The Spanish ace had lobbied for a public course, arguing that only that  way would the Ryder Cup help the development of golf among the Spansih people.
Ballesteros later alleged Valderrama had last year offered him the  equivalent of a million dollars in land deals and green fee concessions to  support their bid.
But his former colleagues on the Ryder Cup Committee, men he has accused  of making key decisions behind his back, were convinced that of the seven  candidates, Valderrama was the right choice.
The others were Novo Sancti Petri, Seville, La Moraleja (Madrid), El Saler  (Valencia), Montecastillo (Jerez) and La Manga (Murcia).
