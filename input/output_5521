Around 2,000 supporters of the Moslem  fundamentalist group HAMAS marched through the autonomous enclave of Jericho  on Monday, in the first such demonstration since Palestinian self-rule.
Palestinian sources said the marchers, who converged on the town from  around the Israeli-occupied West Bank, went on to hold a public meeting in a  mosque.
Brandishing the Koran, the Moslem holy book, and waving flags, they called  for the "liberation of the whole of Palestine." However, they steered clear in  their slogans of attacking the Israeli-PLO autonomy deal, which HAMAS rejects.
Dozens of Palestinian policemen stood by, but there were no incidents, the  sources said. It was the first HAMAS demonstration here since the police took  over Jericho in mid-May.
The Israeli army closed off access to the enclave for Israeli civilians to  avoid incidents, military sources said.
