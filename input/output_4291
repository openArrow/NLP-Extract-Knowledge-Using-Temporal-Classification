NATO Thursday officially denied that Secretary  General Manfred Woerner, who missed two North Atlantic Treaty Organisation  meetings earlier this week through illness, was to resign his post.
A spokesman told reporters "the secretary general has not resigned and has  no intention of resigning."
Woerner, 59, whose mandate runs out in 1996, has been operated on for  stomach cancer three times since April 1992, and in early January he said he  had beaten the illness.
However, on January 14 he was operated on for a severe intestinal blockage  and in early May he postponed indefinitely a visit to the United States.
At the start of the week, Woerner wrote to NATO defence ministers  explaining he would not be able to chair meetings Tuesday and Wednesday, for  medical reasons.
"It was my firm intention to leave the hospital in time to chair the  meetings. Even my doctors were hopeful that this would be possible.
"However they now advise me that the previous untimely interruptions of my  convalescence had taken their toll and that another premature return might  well damage the chances of a full recovery," he said in a letter, published by  NATO Thursday.
However, while Woerner's post is not due to come up for another two years,  a senior European Commission official suggested that the question of a  possible successor to Woerner could be linked to the other international posts  coming up in Europe in the next couple of years.
"Without being morbid, one can imagine an agreement on a global package  including Woerner's post, the president of the European Commission, the  secretary general of the Western European Union and the secretary general of  the EU's council of ministers," the official said, requesting anonymity.
