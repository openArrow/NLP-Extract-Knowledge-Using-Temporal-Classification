Blue-chip stocks rallied along with bonds Tuesday  as financial markets responded favorably to the Federal Reserve action  boosting two key interest rates.
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 49.11 points at 3,720.61, its  highest level since March 28.
On the broader market, advancers beat decliners by 1,344 to 827, with 628  unchanged. Almost 311 million shares were traded, including 68 million during  the final hour of trading.
The Fed action, which was widely anticipated, could mean interest rates  will remain stable for some time, analysts said.
The US central bank raised the overnight interbank rate half a percentage  point from 3.75 percent to 4.25 percent and its discount rate from 3.0 to 3.5  percent.
Stocks also benefited from a dip in long-term interest rates on the bond  market. Interest rates on the main 30-year Treasury bond averaged 7.27  percent, down from 7.44 percent Monday.
Citicorp, the parent bank of Citibank, gained 1-3/4 to 38-7/8, Bankamerica  1-7/8 to 48-3/8 and Chase Manhattan 3/4 to 36-3/8.
Mining stocks fell, with Newmont Mining down 1/2 to 39-1/4 and Homestake  Mining 1/2 to 18-3/4.
