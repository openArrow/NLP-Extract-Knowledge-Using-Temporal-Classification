Dicky the dog escaped conviction in a  paternity suit Saturday after a French court ruled there was insufficient  evidence to suggest he had fathered two young pups.
The case was brought by the owner of Dolly, a young bitch in whom Dicky,  from the Breton village of Guilligomarc'h, had developed a keen interest.
Dolly's owner had demanded damages from Dicky's owner after the alleged  relationship produced the two pups in 1992.
The court at Qiumper, western France, found the suit could not be proven  and ruled Dolly's owner should pay 800 francs (140 dollars) to Dicky's owner  to end two years of squabbling over the affair.
But Dicky did not escape punishment altogether -- his master now keeps him  on a tight lead.
