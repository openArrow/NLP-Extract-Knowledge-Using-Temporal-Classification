Right-wing hardliner Ariel Sharon announced  Friday he would run for prime minister in Israel's 1996 elections, provoking  outrage from his party leader Benjamin Netanyahu.
"I intend to submit my candidacy to lead the nationalist camp and save the  state of Israel, Eretz (Greater) Israel and, to a large decree, the Jewish  people," the Likud MP told Israeli radio.
Sharon, defence minister during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon, said the  right-wing opposition should hold primaries to select its candidate for the  contest against the incumbent Labour Party.
Netanyahu, the Likud leader, reacted angrily and called for Sharon to quit  the party.
"Sharon recognizes none of the rules of democracy. He plotted against  Mehachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir (both former Likud premiers) and now he is  plotting against me," he charged.
"It's high time he left the Likud because all he's doing is sowing  division. Plotting is a chronic illness of his."
The 1996 contest will be the first time that the Israeli electorate elects  the prime minister directly, rather than through party lists to elect members  of parliament.
Raphael Eytan, head of the far-right Tzomet, has also said he would run.
