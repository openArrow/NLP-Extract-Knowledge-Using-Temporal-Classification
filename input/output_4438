A man who sued a bystander for 1.7  million dollars for shooting him while coming to the aid of a police officer  must pay the officer 1.75 million dollars, a jury ruled.
Jesus Puentes, now serving a life sentence for assault, sued Lee Lively  for shooting him twice in the legs.
Lively, a utility repairman, said he intervened in the 1990 incident when  he saw Puentes sitting on Officer Randy Whisenhunt's chest and punching him in  the face. Whisenhunt had stopped Puentes on suspicion of drunken driving.
"I was trying to save his life, and it didn't seem like you ought to be  sued over something like that," said Lively.
A Tarrant County jury~8]Ldd Wednesday that Puentes would not receive any  money -- but would be required to pay the police officer 1.75 million dollars  instead.
The result was hailed as a denunciation of a New York case in which a  subway mugger shot by police successfully sued for 4.3 million dollars.
Juror Elsie Bowles said: "We just wanted to make a statement. We're tired  of the frivolous lawsuits that are plaguing our court system.
