North Korea was obliged to begin extracting fuel  rods from its Yongbyon reactor for safety reasons and because of Washington's  refusal to resume talks on the nuclear issue, the North Korean ambassador to  China said Friday.
Washington had failed to honour pledges to provide North Korea with a  light water reactor and to hold a third round of talks with Pyongyang  following their last meeting in Geneva in July, Ambassador Chu Chang-Jun said.
As a result "replacement of the fuel rods could not be delayed any longer  because of safety considerations," Chu told a press conference.
Chu stressed that Pyongyang had, on four occasions, informed the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in advance of its intention to  replace the rods.
It was therefore unfair for the agency to criticise North Korea for going  ahead, he said.
The IAEA said Thursday that its inspectors currently in North Korea had  confirmed that replacement had begun in "serious violation" of IAEA inspection  terms, and said it would report the action to the UN Security Council.
The agency called on North Korea to stop immediately any further  withdrawal of the rods, saying that as of Thursday it would still be possible  to implement required safety measures so as to verify whether any fuel has  been diverted.
However, Chu indicated that such verification would be dependent on a  resumption of talks between Washington and Pyongyang.
"We will keep the fuel rods in a safe place and seal them for the  inspectors so they can verify that nuclear materials have not been diverted  for non-peaceful purposes," he said.
"When the next round of talks between North Korea and the United States is  held and a technical solution is realised, then the agency can take  measurements at any time."
Washington suspects the reactor, 90 kilometers (54 miles) north of  Pyongyang, is a nuclear bomb factory, and wants the IAEA to check whether  North Korea has been diverting weapons-grade plutonium to manufacture a  device.
In a further indication that Pyongyang had no intention of immediately  halting the replacement procedure, Chu said the process "is under way and will  last about two months."
