The European Union's administrator for Mostar, the  southern Bosnian city divided between Moslems and Croats, began a two-day  visit there Wednesday.
German politician Hans Koschnik made a tour of the Moslem eastern half of  Mostar where he met local leaders and assessed the scale of damage caused by  ten months of bombardments by Croat forces.
He then passed to the west side across an improvised bridge over the  Neretva river. The town's historic Old Bridge was destroyed last November by  Croat artillery fire.
A priority task of the future EU administration will be to re-establish  the electrical network and getting drinking water running again in eastern  Mostar, Koschnik told reporters.
He was later to meet leaders of a self-styled Croat republic in Bosnia,  the Croat agency HABENA said.
A former mayor of Bremen in Germany, Koschnik will assume the  administration of Mostar for a two-year transition period, as agreed in the  Moslem-Croat federation accord signed in Washington in early March.
Koschnik, quoted by Croat radio, said his post would only become effective  when the practical backup had been put in place by the EU, Moslems and Croats.
A meeting to arrange that is to be held soon in Greece, Ivan Bender,  president of the Bosnian Croat parliament, the radio said.
On Thursday, Koschnik is to tour the future administration's prospective  headquarters -- a former hotel and school building. The authority is expected  to number several hundred people.
