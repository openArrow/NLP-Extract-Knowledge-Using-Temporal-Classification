A British soldier was killed in Northern Ireland  overnight by a bomb blast near an army roadblock in an attack claimed by the  Irish Republican Army (IRA), police said Sunday.
The bomb exploded in the village of Keady, near the border with the Irish  Republic.
The soldier died shortly after being taken to hospital. Another soldier  was slightly wounded in the attack.
The IRA claimed responsibility in calls to local media.
The soldier was the 26th person to die in sectarian violence this year in  Northern Ireland.
In another incident, in west Belfast a mixed patrol of British troops and  police fired several plastic bullets at a group of youths throwing stones and  bottles at them.
Four soldiers were slightly hurt. Police did not report any civilian  casualties.
Police also reported that loyalist gunmen began shooting Sunday as about  500 republican nationalists demonstrated in central Belfast but the incident  did not cause any injuries.
Authorities said that the demonstrators, marching to commemorate the 1981  death in prison of IRA hunger strikers, were heading towards the City Hall  when the shooting began as they were passing near the Protestant neighborhood  of Shankill.
The Ulster Freedom Fighters later claimed in a communique that two of its  members were responsible for the shooting.
