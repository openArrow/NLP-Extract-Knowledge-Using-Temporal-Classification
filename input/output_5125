A gang of 20 gunmen mowed down five  people in a sugarcane plantation in Natal Saturday, killing four of them and  wounding the fifth, SABC radio reported Sunday.
The state-owned radio gave no details of the attack, which it said took  place at Ndedwe, north of Durban.
Ndwedwe was the scene of bloody rivalry before South Africa's election  late last month between supporters of the African National Congress and the  Inkatha Freedom Party.
