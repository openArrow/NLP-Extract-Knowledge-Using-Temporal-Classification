Sydney-listed Accor Asia Pacific Corp. is  embarking on several hotel ventures in China with the establishment of a  regional office in Beijing next week, a senior executive said Thursday.
"We have ambitious plans in China," said Roy Olsson, chief executive of  Accor China.
"Realistically speaking, we have at least 30 hotels planned in China for  the next five years," he said, adding that the group would move its northeast  Asia regional office from Hong Kong to Beijing next week.
The group, formed last year between French-based Accor SA and Quality  Pacific Corp. of Australia, manages two hotels in Shanghai, a Sofitel and a  Novotel, and one in Beijing.
Olsson said the planned hotel projects, starting with northeastern China,  where there is a shortage of medium rate city hotels, depended largely in the   Chinese partners -- "things can move faster or slower."
Under the plans, most of the hotels will be redeveloped from existing  hotels in order to meet the urgent demand for better hotels in the northeast,  where Accor sees "a golden opportunity" because of increasing foreign  investment in the industrial cities there.
Olsson said that by doing so "it reduces the time and preparation for new  hotels being set up," adding that the existing hotels were in prime sites.
He said the group is preparing to raise 200 million US dollars in  international markets, though he could not give a date.
Accor has issued 70 million ordinary shares in Sydney to raise 61.6  million Australian dollars (44.4 million US), which is earmarked for financing  its expansion into China. It is also negotiating for several hotels in  Thailand, Vietnam, Burma, and Laos.
