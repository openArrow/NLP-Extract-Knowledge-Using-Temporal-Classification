The US decision to maintain China's preferential  trade status will boost negotiations and bringing Beijing into the  soon-te-be-created World Trade Organization (WTO), the EU commission said  Friday.
A commission spokesman said that while Washington's decision should not  ease efforts to improve China's human rights record, "one of the best ways to  improve this is to reintegrate the country into the world trade system, not to  isolate it."
The European Commission's aim now is to conclude negotiations by the end  of the year on China's entry into the WTO, which will replace the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on January 1, the spokesman said.
