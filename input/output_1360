Indonesia has proposed mid-November  for a summit of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders, officials said in  the Bali capital Tuesday.
The offer came on the eve of a second round of talks to prepare the  informal leaders' summit.
"We should hold the meeting around the 15th at the palace in Bogor," said  Indonesian spokesman Bintoro Tjokoramidjojo. Bogor was the residence of the  Dutch colonial governors from 1870 to 1942.
Bintoro said there will be a break of two or three days between an APEC  ministerial meeting and the leaders' gathering. Indonesia has proposed  November 11-12 for the ministerial summit in Jakarta.
Senior officials from APEC's 17 member-countries are to start a three-day  meeting here Wednesday, the second this year, to prepare for the ministerial  and leader's summit.
A third round is expected to be hold in Yogyakarta, central Java, in  September.
The first APEC summit was held in the United States last year and Bintoro  said there would be "exactly the same format" this year. Chile will be taking  part in the talks for the first time this year.
