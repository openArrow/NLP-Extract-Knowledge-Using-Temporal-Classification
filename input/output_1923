US forces launched a three-day, semi-annual  evacuation drill here Thursday for dependents and American civilians residing  in South Korea, US authorities said.
The US Eighth Army described the drill as "a routine check" of their  manpower, paperwork and evacuation preparedness and said it had nothing to do  with tension over North Korea's nuclear program.
"It is a semi-annual drill, not directly related to the nuclear deadlock,"  said a spokesman for the 36,000 US soldiers here.
He declined to give further details on the drill called "non-combatant  evacuation operations."
US and South Korean troops have maintained tight vigilance at bases here  because of the running standoff between Washington and Pyongyang over  suspicions surrounding the North's nuclear progam.
