Japan's Crown Prince Naruhito and Princess Masako  will visit several Middle Eastern countries from late October through early  November, the Sankei newspaper reported Friday.
The daily said the imperial couple would choose to visit three or four  countries from among Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman,  Qatar and Bahrain.
The trip would be the royal couple's first trip abroad together since  their marriage in June last year, the daily said.
The crown prince's visit to the Middle East was initially planned for  February 1991 but postponed due to the outbreak of the Gulf War, it added.
His visit to the region was then officially set for two weeks from January  22 last year, but again postponed due to tension in the Gulf.
An Imperial Household Agency spokesman declined to confirm the report, but  added that "it is true the visit has been postponed. So the government intends  to do something about it."
