Williams driver Damon Hill, McLaren's Mika Hakkinen and Martin Brundle,  and Tyrrell's Ukyo Katayama have all reported the cars were "less stable"  through corners.
The cars were substantially slower in testing, up to three seconds a lap  at Silverstone and Jerez in southern Spain.
But from a spectator's point of view the cars will look pretty much the  same.
Jordan chief designer Gary Anderson said the cars could be 20kph slower -  210 instead of 230 kph - in the last corner at Barcelona.
"But I don't think that will really be noticeable to spectators.
"The main thing is that anything which reduces the speed of the cars in  the corners has to make racing safer," Anderson said.
At the request of the new drivers' association, the Barcelona circuit has  been modified in the past few days with larger run-off areas, gravel traps and  other safety measures, mainly in the fast Repsol and Nissan corners.
Concrete blocks marking the pit entrance have been replaced by tyres.
Three of the teams still have to nominate second drivers for the race  following the spate of accidents.
Williams are expected to run Scottish test driver David Coulthard, 23, at  least for this race, in place of Senna.
Hill will anxious for a good result after his first-corner accident with  Hakkinen at Monaco, but Coulthard will be under orders to take it cautiously  in his first Grand Prix.
"I can remember my own feelings the first time I drove in a Grand Prix for  Williams," said Hill, the team's test driver before Coulthard.
"It was one of disbelief that I was actually doing it and not watching it  on television."
Ferrari drivers Gerhard Berger and Jean Alesi had learnt to cope with  their car's inherent handling problems but the flaw has been complicated by  the new rules.
