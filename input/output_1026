The dollar fell here on Monday, shedding gains in  response to publication of figures for US industrial production in April which  were in line with expectations.
The dollar closed here at 1.6730 marks, having risen during early trading  to 1.6775 marks. It closed at 104.85 yen having reached 105.20 yen on Asian  markets during the night.
US industrial output rose by 0.3 percent in April and the rate of use of  industrial capacity was unchanged at 83.6 percent. These figures had been  expected and the dollar, in the absence of any driving factor, fell, Canadian  Imperial Bank of Commerce analyst Nick Parsons said.
Dealers continued to expect the open markets committee of the US federal  reserve to increase interest rates by a quarter or a half a point on Tuesday.
The drachma, which has been under severe pressure during the last few  days, held steady at 148.10 to the mark from 148.08 at the close in Athens and  148.32 in London on Friday.
But opinions about this varied. Schroder bank analyst Evricos Sarventis  said that the authorities had succeeded in fighting speculation by  liberalising capital flows and increasing interesat rates. He did not expect  to see a major devaluation of the drachma in the near future.
But Parsons said that the market was convinced that it would be devalued  and only the date was in question. Dealers in London believed that the Greek  authorities would try to avoid a devaluation before Greece relinquished the  presidency of the European Union council of ministers on June 30, and that the  drachma would be devalued at the beginning of July.
The mark fell to 3.4297 French francs from 3.4315 at the close on Friday  but rose to 961.5 lire from 958.8 lire.
Sterling was supported by an increase of 0.3 percent in British factory  gate prices in April which took the increase in the 12 months to the end of  April to 2.2 percent. This was the lowest 12-monthly figure since December  1986.
Sterling was at 1.5030 dollars against 1.4990 on Friday, at 2.5145 marks  against 2.5003, at 157.59 yen against 157.17, at 2.1433 Swiss francs against  2.1376 and at 8.6253 French francs against 8.5687.
The dollar was at 1.6730 marks against 1.6680, was unchanged at 104.85 yen  and 1.4260 Swiss francs, and was at 5.7388 French francs against 5.7162.
The price of gold was steady at 380.25 dollars anounce from 380.75 dollars.
