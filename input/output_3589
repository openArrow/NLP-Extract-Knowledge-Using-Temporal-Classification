Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk accused Russian  President Boris Yeltsin Tuesday of violating international law by intervening  in the political crisis between Ukraine and its separatist republic of Crimea.
"The Russian president may warn his own institutions but not the president  of another state," Kravchuk told a group of World War II veterans he was  meeting with.
Yeltsin last Friday called on Ukraine not to use force in responding to  Crimea's decision to restore a 1992 constitution which grants the  predominantly Russian-populated republic on the Black Sea greater autonomy  from Kiev.
Yeltsin also said that neither Ukraine nor Russia should intervene in  Crimea.
Kravchuk also wondered out loud before his audience Tuesday whether recent  comments by Sergei Filatov, Yeltsin's chief of staff, represented "the  position of the Russian state."
Filatov implicitly criticized Kravchuk on Monday by denouncing "those  irresponsible politicians seeking to take advantage of the situation (in  Crimea) in order to delay presidential elections" scheduled June 26 in Ukraine.
Kravchuk stressed that the Crimean issue must not become a source of  discord between Ukraine and Russia.
He said that as long as Crimean leaders did not recognize that the  autonomous republic was "an integral part of Ukraine" there was no room for  compromise on the issue.
The Ukrainian parliament has declared the Crimean independence move  "illegal" and has given the local legislature up until Monday to reverse its  decision.
