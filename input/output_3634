Israel on Tuesday closed off the  autonomous enclave of Jericho after Palestinian police briefly detained five  armed settlers, an army spokesman said.
The area was being closed to all non-residents for 24 hours "to allow  Palestinian police chiefs to get organised and inform all their men of the  extent of their powers," he said.
General Ilan Biran, military commander for the West Bank, had issued the  order "to avoid any more friction or misunderstandings with Israeli citizens."
Palestinian police arrested three Israelis from the nearby Namaa  settlement and confiscated their guns as they shopped in the town's market on  Tuesday morning.
They were later released and had their weapons returned after Israeli  officers intervened, the spokesman said.
However, the police arrested two more armed settlers in a similar incident  later in the day.
Ilana Levy, an official from the settlement, said of the first incident:  "They were quietly buying vegetables in the Jericho market, as we have done  for the last 20 years, when Palestinian policemen arrested them and  confiscated their weapons."
"This incident will cause a lot of trouble. It would be a scandal if we  could not freely enter Jericho, where everybody knows us and where we have  never had any problems."
The May 4 Israel-PLO agreement allows Israeli and Palestinian civilians to  carry weapons for self-defense, provided they possess permits.
Palestinian police on Monday fired on an Israeli car which drove through a  joint checkpoint in the other self-rule region, the Gaza Strip, without  stopping.
Israeli radio said officials were considering translating from English to  Arabic the May 4 agreement to allow the Palestinian policemen to read it.
