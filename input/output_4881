Indian troops were called out Saturday to  restore peace after rioting left at least 13 people dead and hundreds injured  in the north-eastern frontier state of Assam.
The Assam government called in the army to the riot-hit district of  Kokrajhar after sending police and paramilitary reinforcements, Chief Minister  Hiteshwar Saikia told the Press Trust of India.
Fighting between Bodo tribespeople and Assamese natives broke out Friday  night in the Bodo-dominated countryside surrounding Kokrajhar, the news agency  said.
Bodo arsonists went on the rampage in 10 villages, setting non-Bodo homes  and property on fire.
"Some of the villages were burning throughout the night and smoke is still  billowing out," PTI quoted official sources in Guwahati, Assam's principal  city, as saying.
At least 13 people were killed and hundreds were injured, it said, adding  that the toll was expected to increase.
Most victims were reported to be non-tribal natives of Assam, an oil- and  mineral-rich state of 22 million bordering Bangladesh hit by periodic  outbreaks of ethnic trouble.
Saikia announced a compensation of 100,000 rupees (3,330 dollars) for  families of each of the dead and promised to rehabilitate all survivors. He  ordered district authorities to set up relief camps to shelter residents whose  homes had been destroyed.
The latest rioting was a sequel to Bodo demands that non-tribal settlers  leave Bodo-dominated villages in Kokrajhar, where 50 people were killed in  ethnic violence last October, PTI said.
A militant section of the Bodos have been campaigning for their own tribal  homeland to be carved out of Assam, which is also the site of an insurgency  led by Assamese extremists fighting for secession from India.
