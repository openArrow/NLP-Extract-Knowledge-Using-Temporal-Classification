Germany is ready to support a United Nations aid  operation in Rwanda by providing a military transport plane, but will not send  troops, government spokesman Dieter Vogel said Thursday.
Ministers expressed a readiness to send a Transall, but security  conditions at Kigali airport had first to be clarified, he said after a  cabinet meeting.
The question of whether such a contribution posed a constitutional problem  also had to be checked, Vogel said referring to cases currently before the  constitutional court in Karlsruhe.
The court is due next month to give a ruling on the constitutionality of  the various missions abroad in which the German armed forces have participated  over the past year.
Vogel said the UN had also asked the German government to provide  logistical support in the form of a military medical unit, but opined there  was no chance that Bonn would send soldiers "given the overall situation."
The Munich Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported Thursday that the foreign  ministry favoured sending armed forces doctors and nurses while the defence  ministry was strictly opposed.
