Northern League leader Umberto Bossi and  former socialist prime minister Bettino Craxi will be tried for corruption in  July in connection with the Enimont scandal, judicial officials said Tuesday.
The trial of Bossi, whose movement is part of Prime Minister Silvio  Berlusconi's governing coalition, Craxi and 30 other leading figures from  Italy's political and commercial establishment will begin July 5, the  officials said.
Enimont was the name of a failed merger at the end of the 1980s between  state energy concern ENI and the private Ferruzzi-Montedison conglomerate.
An estimated 100 million dollars in bribes to political parties were paid  out during its abortive formation.
Bossi is to be charged over 120,000 dollars allegedly paid to the Northern  League, the officials said.
The League presented itself in March elections as the party untainted by  the series of corruption scandals which have discredited Italy's post-war  political establishment.
For Craxi, the trial is the latest of several in which he is due to appear  as the former head of the Socialist Party, one of the movements which is said  to have benefited most from corruption.
