Hong Kong's banks Friday raised interest rates  by 0.5 of a percentage point on overnight and savings deposits and rates on  term deposits by 0.75 of a percentage point.
The Hong Kong Association of Banks at its weekly meeting made no decision  about lifting the prime rate, which stands at 6.75 percent.
It last raised the prime rate -- by 25 basis points -- on March 25,  marking the first increase since July 1992 despite sustained high inflation.
A rise in the prime rate was expected following a decision Tuesday by the  US Federal Reserve Board to lift its key discount rate by 50 basis points to  3.5 percent and its federal funds rate by the same amount to 4.25 percent.
