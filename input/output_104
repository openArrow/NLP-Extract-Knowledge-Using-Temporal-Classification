Philippine Vice President Joseph Estrada Friday  asked local organizers of a controversial East Timor conference to hold it  abroad so the Philippines could avoid a diplomatic rift with Indonesia.
"Let us not invite unnecessary irritants to this relationship. Moving the  conference out of the country is for the larger national interest," said a  statement issued by Estrada's office.
Estrada recently returned from Johannesburg where he had attended the  inauguration of the new South African government.
While in South Africa he met Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas to  distance Manila from the May 31-June 2 meeting, organized by activist groups  here, European jurists and exiled Fretilin rebels.
"While we respect the human rights issue, the holding of the conference is  untimely because of the ongoing peace talks in Indonesia," Estrada said,  referring to Jakarta's sponsorship of peace negotiations between the  Philippine government and Moslem guerrillas.
But the local organizers said the conference, intended to expose Jakarta's  human rights record in the former Portuguese colony of East Timor, would go  ahead despite the abrupt and unexplained withdrawal of French First Lady  Danielle Mitterrand, who was to have delivered the keynote address.
President Fidel Ramos said Wednesday that bilateral ties were strong  enough to withstand such "irritants," but stressed that it would be  unconstitutional for Manila to try to stop the holding of the conference.
