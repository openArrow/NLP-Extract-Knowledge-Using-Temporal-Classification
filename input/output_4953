The 48-year-old, who has lived in France since 1978, coached Ivory Coast  to  third place in the African Nations Cup in Tunisia in January when the home  side crashed out in the first round.
He was capped 67 times by Poland and played in the 1974 and 1978 World  Cups.
He was player and then coach at Metz from 1978 to 1984 and then managed St  Etienne, Strasbourg, Racing Paris, Montpellier and Lille before taking over  Ivory Coast last December.
