Authorities in the United States  and Britain broke up an international counterfeit ring after the arrest of a  British national in West Virginia, officials said Wednesday.
Mike Young, special agent in charge of the Treasury Department's Secret  Service in West Virginia, said four people were arrested in London and one in  Miami, Florida, following the arrest of 43-year-old Timothy Olsen-Vetland in  March.
About 19 million dollars in fake bills from Britain, Ireland, Spain,  Nigeria and Romania were seized in London, Young said. Printing plates for US  bills also were seized.
According to court documents, an undercover federal agent posing as a  banker arranged for shipment of the bills to Huntington. Olsen-Vetland was  arrested March 7 with 10,200 dollars in fake 100-dollar bills.
The suspect is to be accompanied back to London by Scotland Yard  inspectors, authorities said.
