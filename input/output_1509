Japan's Casio Computer Co. Ltd. said Wednesday its  group profit before tax dived 30.4 percent from a year earlier to 8.5 billion  yen (83 million dollars) in the year to March but forecast a rebound.
The leading manufacturer of digital watches and calculators said worldwide  sales dropped 11.1 percent to 384 billion yen. Sales abroad plunged 27.7  percent to 197 billion yen as a result of the stronger yen, slashing the  overseas share of total revenue from almost two thirds to barely a half.
Calculator sales dropped 2.3 percent to 139 billion yen, watch sales fell  8.9 percent at 85 billion yen and sales of electronic musical instruments  tumbled 36 percent to 33 billion yen. Sales of systems equipment and other  products dived 12.3 percent to 127 billion yen, the company said.
Casio forecast an improved consolidated profit of 14.5 billion yen in the  current year with sales recovering to 420 billion yen.
The company said it would boost overseas procurement to counter the impact  of the stronger yen as part of continued efforts to restructure its activities.
"We especially want to promote activities in the promising markets of  telcommunications, digital video equipment and electronic devices," Casio said.
