A high-level two-man mission from the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived in Pyongyang Tuesday to discuss with North  Korean officials the controversial replacement of fuel rods at a nuclear  reactor.
IAEA spokesman Hans-Frierich Meyer said the two envoys would probably meet  with North Korean officials Wednesday but he refused to disclose the indentity  of those taking part in the talks.
The envoys are to work out inspection procedures with three IAEA  inspectors who have been in North Korea since May 17.
"We are going for technical talks and expect to be there for three or four  days," said earlier one of the mission members, Demetrius Perricos.
The growing row over Pyongyang's refusal to allow full inspections of two  of its nuclear complexes, suspected by Washington of shielding a secret  weapons programme, has heightened tension on the Korean peninsula.
The IAEA said last Thursday that North Korea had begun extracting spent  fuel rods from its five-megawatt Yongbyon reactor, 90 kilometers (54 miles)  north of Pyongyang, in a "serious violation" of IAEA inspection terms and that  it would inform the UN Security Council.
On Friday, the agency rejected a North Korean proposal to keep fuel rods  from the controversial nuclear reactor in a "safe place under seal" ahead of a  resumption of talks on the issue, saying it would inhibit verification that no  nuclear material had been diverted for military use.
The IAEA wants to measure the fuel rods to determine how long they have  been in the reactor and thereby calculate whether any plutonium could have  been diverted for military purposes.
On Friday, US Defense Secretary William Perry said North Korea had not  diverted any nuclear fuel since the rod operation had begun.
IAEA sources here said the spent rods extracted were too radioactive to be  moved for the time being.
