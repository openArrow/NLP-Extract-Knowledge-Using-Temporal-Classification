The French Open Tennis Championships continued to  take a heavy toll as the favourites opened their 1994 campaigns at the Roland  Garros Stadium here on Tuesday -- a day which began with heavy rain and ended  in sunshine.
Blustery winds blew Stefan Edberg's serve off-track and the popular Swede  headed for the nearest exit after crashing in five-sets to compatriot Henrik  Holm.
It wasn't something the 28-year-old Edberg does often. His last defeat  against a fellow-Swede came when he was beaten by Magnus Larsson at the Monte  Carlo Open... in 1991. In his four-hour match against Holm, Edberg hit 18  double-faults and his latest defeat put another nail in his hopes of winning  the only major title that has always escaped him.
"Time is running out now," he admitted sadly as he left the Stadium  determined to find a grass-court tournament to play next week and enhance his  preparation for Wimbledon.
The other casualty in the men's ranks was the 1992 finalist Petr Korda.
The 26-year-old Czech, seeded 12, went slowly off the boil and slumped to  a five-sets defeat to promising Italian Andrea Gaudenzi. He won won only four  games in the last two sets.
The day's other favourites to fall by the wayside were all women --  fifth-seed Jana Novotna, the number-six Kimiko Date, eighth-seed Gabriela  Sabatini and fourteenth-seed Zina Garrison-Jackson joined Monday's casualties  Martina Navratilova and Magdalena Maleeva on the sidelines.
The defeats left France's twelfth-seed Mary Pierce with a clear run  towards a potential semi-final against defending champion Steffi Graf, and  Spain's number-three seed Conchita Martinez with a similar situation in the  bottom-half of the draw. Martinez is scheduled to play Arantxa Sanchez in the  semi-finals.
Gabriela Sabatini failed to pass the first hurdle for the first time in  ten campaigns at the world's most gruelling tournament.
