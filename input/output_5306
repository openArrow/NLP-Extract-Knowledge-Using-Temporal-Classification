"My sunny disposition is going everywhere with me these days." --  Twice-champion JIM COURIER on his new relaxed attitude to life off court.
"I know what to do against myself." -- Defending champion STEFFI GRAF  after defeating Romania's Irina Spirlea -- being hailed as the new Graf --  6-0, 6-1.
"I can't do better than win." -- Sweden's MAGNUS LARSSON, asked if he  could "do better" after putting out seeded American Todd Martin to reach the  last sixteen of the men's singles.
"It is a little bit scary." -- Fifth-seeded GORAN IVANISEVIC, asked how it  felt to be the only seeded player left in the bottom-half of the men's draw.
"I think the people here likes me. And the clay I like very much. I feel  like at home here. This is special ..." -- Spain's 1989 champion ARANTXA  SANCHEZ asked why she likes the French Open the best of the major tournaments.
