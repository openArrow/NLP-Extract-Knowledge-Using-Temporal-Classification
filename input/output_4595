The 6ft 2in Czech player went down to talented Argentinian Ines  Gorrochategui 6-7 (8-10), 6-7 (1/7) in an exciting third-round battle on an  outside court.
The South American, who will be 21 next month and who is already being  hailed as the new Sabatini, is currently ranked 36th in the world.
Making her third visit to Paris, Gorrochategui had never previously got  further than the second-round.
A finalist at Auckland earlier this year and a quarter-finalist in Berlin,  Gorrochategui now plays Karin Scwendt of Germany or 21st-ranked Croatian  teenager Iva Majoli for a place in the quarter-finals.
In the men's singles it was just like the old days for Jim Courier.
The American, looking relaxed and concentrated, powered towards a probable  quarter-final showdown with world number-one Pete Sampras when he beat  Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman 6-3, 6-1, 6-1.
Bidding for a third win here after his victories in 1991 and 1992, Courier  needed just 1hour 48min to reach a fourth-round tie against the winner of the  all-French clash between Fabrice Santoro and Olivier Delaitre.
It was a classic piece of grinding by Courier that took him past the Swede.
A 4th game break gave him a closely-fought first set 6-3 and he  immediately turned the screw with a break at the start of the third.
The finest of drop shots and a bullet return of serve set up a second  break to put Courier 4-1 ahead. And another fierce return brought him a third  break and the set.
By the second game of the third, the Swede's confidence was in tatters. He  splayed an overhead smash at the net wide and then made two unforced backhand  errors to gift Courier his break.
From there it was one-way traffic and Courier typically wrapped things up  with a powerful mid-court volley.
