Hope for Morocco's children lies in a  ground-breaking conference being staged in Casablanca to draw up a national  plan for implementing the UN convention on children's rights signed by Rabat  last June.
Organisers said the conference, to be attended by the director-general of  the United Nations Children's Fund, James Grant, and other foriegn  specialists, is also the first of its kind to be held in Africa or the Arab  world.
They said the three-day meeting would express Morocco's intention to find  the means necessary to integrate the international convention into a national  strategy for improving the health, education and family life of the child.
The conference starting Wednesday is being staged amid regular  denunciations by the press and opposition parties of abuse of children in  Morocco.
The opposition daily Liberation estimated that half of children aged  between 10 and 14 and living in rural areas have no education, and that 27  percent of infants die before they are one year old.
Liberation also said children had no suitable legal protection, drawing  attention to the recent case of five youngesters left paralysed after inhaling  toxic glue fumes at their place of work.
