One elephant died and another was in a  critical condition from injuries sustained when they were recaptured following  their escape from an enclosure at a private reserve north of Natal province,  Business Day reported Friday.
The daily said the two female victims and eight other members of their  family had escaped Tuesday from a special enclosure at the Phinda reserve  where they were being held temporarily following their transfer only 24 hours  earlier from Kruger's National Park.
They were recaptured Wednesday by rescue teams that used tranquilizers but  one of the elephants died the following day and another one was in a critical  condition, the daily said.
The herd was part of a group of 158 elephants that faced a certain death  at Kruger's National Park where officials annually kill about 350 elephants in  order to maintain a balance in the park's "eco-system" and its elephant  population, which varies between 7,000 and 8,000.
An international animal protection group had spared them that fate earlier  this month by organizing the transfer of the 158 elephants to eight reserves  throughout South Africa.
But prior to releasing the animals in their new habitat, they were to be  placed in special enclosures for 24 hours in order to get used to the change  in environment.
Another group of elephants transferred to a reserve in Transvaal province  also reportedly escaped from its enclosure.
