Mozambique's President Joaquim Chissano on Monday  continued a round of provincial visits widely seen as the first, unofficial  phase of his campaign ahead of October elections.
Chissano was awaited in northern Nampula, the nation's most populous  province and crucial for an electoral victory.
He is also to visit Cabo Delgado on Mozambique's northern border with  Tanzania during the next 11 days before returning to Maputo.
Cabo Delgado is seen as the home of Chissano's ruling Mozambique  Liberation Front (FRELIMO) party, whose struggle against Portuguese colonials  began and found its rear base in the region in the 1960s and 1970s.
Chissano visited Gaza province in April, Sofala and Tete in early May and  has claimed these are ordinary trips by a head of state, but the statements he  makes at the public rallies during these trips seem geared towards elections.
"I feel as if I had already been re-elected," he said during a trip to  Gaza last month.
Meanwhile, a government delegation which negotiated a 1992 peace accord to  end civil war with former rebels of the Mozambique National Resistance  (RENAMO), Monday headed for Rome for discussions with the main mediators, a  Roman Catholic community, and with the new Italian government.
Mozambique's peace process is meant to end with general elections in  October, but has been delayed as demobilisation of the rival armies stalled.
It now seems unlikely that a joint new national army can be fully trained  ahead of elections.
The United Nations peacekeeping operation here, UNOMOZ, is due to  terminate its operation in November this year.
RENAMO recently announced that its leader Afonso Dhlakama will on June 3  meet the UN Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in New York, while  government sources say they are under renewed western pressure to reach a  pre-election compromise on power with RENAMO, after the South African model.
