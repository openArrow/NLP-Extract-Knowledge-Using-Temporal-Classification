The Supreme Court has rejected an emergency  petition to block a US soldier's transfer to a South Korean prison to serve a  15-year sentence for slaying a prostitute.
Private Kenneth Markle III was scheduled to be transfered Monday from an  Army detention center in South Korea to the prison.
His father, Kenneth Markle Jr., filed the petition Friday to block the  transfer until a federal appeals court could hear his suit challenging the  government's role in the younger Markle's conviction.
But in a ruling made public Monday, Supreme Court Chief Justice William  Rehnquist rejected the petition the same day it was filed.
"I knew it was very much a long shot going in," said Stephen Jory,  Markle's attorney. "We're disappointed but not surprised."
Markle says his son was denied a fair trial because the Pentagon was  anxious to ease tensions with South Korea, where the murder prompted protests  by women's rights activists and students opposed to the US military presence  there.
The justice department says constitutional protections to not apply to  proceedings in foreign courts.
The younger Markle was convicted last year of beating a Korean prostitute  to death in 1992.
He told US army investigators he hit Yun Kum-i, 26, several times with a  bottle after she attacked him in her room near the US 2nd Infantry Division  headquarters outside Seoul.
