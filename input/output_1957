Russia's pilots Thursday suspended a strike until  next month, saying they would resume negotiations with the government later in  the day on improving air security and boosting pensions, ITAR-TASS reported.
"We have suspended the strike until June 2 in order to try one more time  to find a compromise" with the government, said pilots' union official Alfred  Malynovski.
The Russian transport ministry, which condemned the strike, started  Wednesday, as illegal, confirmed that 49 of Russia's 150 airports were  affected by the work stoppage on Wednesday, though it said only three percent  of flights suffered delays.
On top of better air security and a review of retirement pay, the pilots  want the government to create an "employment fund" to avoid the dismissal of  what the union said were plans to lay off 8,000 of the country's 62,500  civilian pilots.
A recent report by a commission covering security in the Commonwealth of  Independent States found the risk of fatal accidents in the former Soviet  Union was 10 times higher than elsewhere.
The drop in safety standards has become more marked with the break-up of  former Soviet carrier Aeroflot into 150 smaller companies all fighting to make  ends meet.
Transport Minister Vitaly Yefimov had minimized the falling safety  standards Tuesday but acknowledged the death rate per million passengers had  gone up from 3.5 to 5.5 since 1992.
Whereas pilots used to belong to a relatively privileged profession, their  work conditions have recently deteriorated.
One striking pilot earning 600,000 rubles a month (320 dollars) explained  he was still working at 65 in order to avoid receiving a mere 100.000 rubles  (53 dollars) in retirement pay.
