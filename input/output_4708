Beggars are eyesores, discourage  shoppers, drive away tourists and have no right to be on the streets, British  Prime Minister John Major said in an interview published here Friday.
Major said beggars were "very offensive to many people," and that  law-abiding citizens should be more vigorous in reporting them to the police.
British law, he told the Bristol Evening News, includes prison sentences  for public begging and the law "is there to be used."
"We have rigorous penalties against it and I think we should not shrink  from using these penalties," he said.
The maximum penalty for begging, he said, is a 1,000 pound (1,500 dollar)  fine and three years in jail.
Major claimed the public benefit system eliminated the need for people to  resort to begging.
"It is not acceptable to be out on the street," he was quoted as saying.  "There is no justification for it these days."
Major's views on the subject were expect to draw fire from Britain's  homeless lobby, which contends people are forced to beg on the streets because  they are destitute.
Last month, Major told the German magazine Der Spiegel that many of  London's homeless "chose to live" that way, saying, "There are empty places in  accommodation units across London and in other areas where people could go if  they wished."
A spokesman in Major's office in London declined to comment on the Bristol  interview, saying she had not seen it.
