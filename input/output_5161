Erich Honecker, who ruled communist East Germany  for 18 years and built the Berlin Wall, died Sunday of liver cancer, family  members said. He was 81 years old.
Honecker, who arrived in Chile in January 1993, died at his home in exile  in Santiago.
He led the German Democratic Republic from 1971 to 1989, but resigned in  October 1989 shortly before the Berlin Wall collpased and fled to Moscow in  March 1991.
Expelled in July 1992, he was tried in Berlin for the deaths of Germans  killed trying to escape to West Germany, but was freed the following year and  allowed to go into exile after being diagnosed with liver cancer.
In Berlin, Honecker's lawyer, Wolfgang Ziegler, confirmed his death.
