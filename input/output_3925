The Greek government Wednesday announced a ban on  private car traffic in Athens Thursday and ordered a 30-percent cut in  industry fuel consumption as Athens choked in early summer heat and pollution.
Wednesday, 90 people were taken to hospital with breathing or heart  troubles, emergency services said after the level of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in  the city's air rose to 490 milligrammes per cubic metre.
The warning level for nitrogen dioxide is at 500 milligramme per cubic  metre. Temperatures Wednesday soared to 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 degrees  Fahrenheit).
With weather forecasts predicting still air and more heat Thursday, city  authorities said they feared a worse than average toxic cloud would form over  the capital unless emergency measures were taken.
The government appealed to people to avoid coming into the city centre  Thursday and advised shop-owners to close early.
Greek Enivronment Minister Costas Laliotis is expected to announce new  measures Friday to fight pollution, with the plans including staggered working  hours for state businesses, ministries and public banks, as well as new  controls on exhaust fumes.
