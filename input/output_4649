English double winners Manchester United have  agreed terms with Blackburn Rovers defender David May.
Oldham-born May will move to Old Trafford when his contract at Ewood Park  expires next month, boosting his new club's European Cup challenge.
A United spokesman said on Friday the fee would be payable either by  agreement or as decided by a tribunal. It could be as much as two million  pounds.
May, 24 next month and a lifelong United fan, can play full-back or in  central defence.
Reds' boss Alex Ferguson may see him as the long-term successor to  33-year-old skipper Steve Bruce.
The news will be a massive blow to Rovers, who, backed by chairman Jack  Walker's millions, chased United nearly all the way to their championship this  season.
Ferguson has been keen to extend his English-born staff before next  season's renewed attempt to lift the European Cup in which the club can play  only three foreigners.
That rule led to them making an early exit last season to Galatasaray of  Turkey.
Oldham Athletic's former Scottish international striker Graeme Sharp has  agreed a new two-year contract.
Newcastle United and Aston Villa are the first winners of the English  Football Association's Fair Play League, and will share a 30,000 pounds prize  to go to charities of their choice.
The FA also made a special award to Liverpool for the good behavior of  their supporters. The 20,000 pounds prize will help improve Anfield spectator  facilities.
