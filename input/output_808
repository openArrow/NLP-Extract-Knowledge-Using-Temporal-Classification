A small group which picketed the home of a  one-time South African white supremacist said Monday it did not regret its  action despite criticism from MPs here.
The former head of the South African chapter of the Church of the Creator,  Jan Smith, has been here for 10 days. He has previously written that the  heritage of the white race is "threatened by our deadly race enemies -- Jews,  kaffirs and the mud races."
Immigration Minister Roger Maxwell has called for reports on how Smith was  allowed to emigrate here.
But Dick Cuthbert of the Stop White South Africans Today (SWAT) group said  they had been "confidentially advised" that Smith will be allowed to stay in  New Zealand.
Cuthbert led about 30 protesters to Smith's home and chanted and banged on  the family's front door during the hour-long protest.
Cuthbert said further protests would depend on how people felt, the  government's decision on Smith's future, and whether Smith would comment on  his background.
"He might come out and apologise," Cuthbert said. "We will want to hear  what he says."
Any future protest would be "absolutely peaceful," he said.
However, Maxwell, opposition Alliance leader Jim Anderton and ruling  National Party MPs Ian Revell and Max Bradford have criticised the protesters'  actions.
Anderton said it was "the sort of tactic that you would have expected from  white racists in South Africa against blacks who have come into the area."
