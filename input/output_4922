A South African general who  resigned in March as head of military intelligence proposed (Eds: correct) the  1985 murder of anti-apartheid activist Matthew Goniwe, a judge announced  Saturday after a two-year inquiry.
Goniwe was killed with three other black militants on June 27 of that  year. Their bodies were mutilated and burnt.
General Joffel van der Westhuizen resigned as head of military  intelligence on March 31 at the age of 51, citing ill health.
Judge Neville Zietman said the general, then regional military commander  in Port Elizabeth, proposed that Goniwe and two other black militants be  "permanently removed from society," and rejected an army interpretation that  this meant Van der Westhuizen was simply recommending that they be jailed.
He added however that there was no proof "directly linking" the general to  the murder, saying that "suspicion does not constitute prima facie proof."
