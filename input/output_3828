Japan's Kumagai Gumi Co. Ltd. said Wednesday its  pre-tax earnings plunged 20 percent to 23.6 billion yen (230 million dollars)  in the year to March and forecast an even sharper plunge this year.
The leading construction company, which has a strong presence overseas,  especially in the United States and Australia, said revenues plunged 21.9  percent to 842 billion yen in the same period.
Kumagai Gumi said the current year would be a "trying ordeal" with  earnings expected to tumble to 15 billion yen on lower revenue of 840 billion  yen.
"In the construction industry, housing construction and public works are  expected to remain firm. But civil engineering projects in the private sector  are expected to remain stagnant, partly due to the depressed level of capital  investment," the company said in a statement.
"The introduction of a general bidding system and the participation of  foreign firms will further intensify the competition for orders. The year  ahead is expected to be a trying ordeal," it warned.
In the latest year, Kumagai Gumi said sales were adversely affected by a  slump in revenue from private-sector construction projects and lower revenue  from civil-engineering projects in both the public and private sectors.
Overseas revenue plunged 63.4 percent to 22 billion yen, accounting for  only 2.6 percent of total turnover, down from 5.5 percent a year before.
Construction revenue tumbled 31 percent to 479 billion yen with revenue  from private-sector projects plunging 38.4 percent to 384 billion yen. But  revenue from public-sector projcets grew 34.1 percent to 95 billion yen.
Civil engineering revenue dropped 7.9 percent to 321 billion yen, falling  5.2 percent to 208 billion yen in the private sector and 12.4 percent to 113  billion yen in the public sector, the company said.
