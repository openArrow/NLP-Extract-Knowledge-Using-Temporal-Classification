Marking Matthaus' improvement, Bayern Munich paid Borussia  Moenchengladbach just over a million dollars, then a West German domestic  record, for him in 1984. But Munich received 3.75m dollars when Matthaus moved  to Inter Milan just four years later.
Matthaus' first three internationals were spread over two years from 1980,  and they were all from the substitutes bench. He appeared in two group matches  in the 1982 World Cup finals, and in three games in the 1984 European Nations  Championship.
Apart from his exploits in the 1986 World Cup, he started with a  "Blitzkrieg" against Yugoslavia in Germany's opening match of the 1990 finals.
Playing in Inter Milan's San Siro stadium, he struck two searing  long-range shots in their 4-1 win over the now FIFA-suspended country. He even  had enough stamina to mark Dragan Stojkovic out of the game, too.
He also scored the only goal of the game against Czechoslovakia from the  spot in the quarter-finals, before eventual victories over both England and  Argentina in semi-final and final.
Who's to say Matthaus won't lead Germany to a record fourth victory and a  record seven final appearances?
