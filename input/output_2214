The experienced Mikhailov, who captains the side, could be the key to  Bulgaria's chances. He performed repeated heroics in qualifying and was  Bulgaria's outstanding performer in the 1986 finals -- when draws with Italy  and South Korea put them into the second round.
Behind the front two, Sporting Lisbon's Krassimir Balakov and Hamburg's  Yordan Letchkov are the best-known of the midfield players while Real Betis  centre back Trifon Ivanov is the defensive anchor.
The fact that most of his players are based abroad has given Penev a major  headache in preparing his squad, as the Bulgarian federation lacks the cash  for him to make regular trips to see his stars in action.
The dour image of eastern European football -- belied by the reality of  the Bulgarians style -- has also made it difficult to arrange warm-up matches  against adequate competition.
In April a half-strength side drew 1-1 with Oman and 2-2 with Kuwait. Two  friendlies with the United Arab Emirates are scheduled for the end of May.
Penev's men then meet Mexican club Guadalajara in early June in their  final run out before they begin being their group D campaign with an  intriguing clash against Nigeria in Dallas on June 21.
The Africans mirror Bulgaria's forward power and defensive frailty, so  their clash promises to be one of the most entertaining of the opening round.
A point against Nigeria and a victory over Greece in Chicago on June 26  would probably be enough to put Bulgaria in the second round before their  final group match against Argentina in Dallas.
