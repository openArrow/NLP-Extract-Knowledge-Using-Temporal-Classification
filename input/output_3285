At least 10 pro-democracy activists were arrested in  Lagos Monday during voting for a constitutional conference proposed by the  military regime, a human rights group said.
The detainees included Tokunbo Afikuyomi, a special assistant to foreign  minister Baba Gana Kingibe, Bola Tinubu, a former senator, and Olusegun  Maiyegun, a former president of the Lagos University students' union, the  Committee for the Defence of Human Rights said.
It added that on Sunday in Port Harcourt, the capital of southeastern  Rivers state, a minority rights advocate, Ken Saro-wiwa, was also arrested.
Press reports said he was arrested in connection with four murders.
A former president of an association of Nigerian authors, he was to have  taken part in Monday's election as a representative of the Ogoni people, a  minority group in the state.
They have over the years complained of marginalisation and fraud by oil  companies operating there.
In another statement, Beko Ransome-Kuti, the national chairman of the  Campaign for Democracy, an umbrella grouping of about 40 pro-democracy and  human rights organisations, commended Nigerians for what he called their  boycott of the election.
The boycott, he said, was the "unanimous verdict" of all Nigerians that a  successful election would remain a "mirage" until the results of last year's  vote, annulled by the military, are released.
Now that Nigerians have boycotted Monday's election, he urged the regime  of General Sani Abacha to resign by May 31 to avert "a national catastrophe."
