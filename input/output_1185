The failures, with liabilities of at least 10 million yen (96,000  dollars), exceeded 1,000 cases for the 15th month in a row, Teikoku Bank Ltd.  said.
Combined liabilities meanwhile grew 6.9 percent to 360.74 billion yen, the  company said.
Bankruptcies caused by the economic slowdown and the consequent slump in  sales rose 7.1 percent from a year earlier to 755 cases, accounting for 64.2  percent of the total, the first highest on record, it said.
