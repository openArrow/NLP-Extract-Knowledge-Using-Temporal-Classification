The Azerbaijani enclave of Nagorno Karabakh was  torn by further fighting Thursday as unconfirmed reports of a possible new  ceasefire circulated.
Russian foreign ministry sources said a ceasefire accord was agreed  Wednesday between the Azeri and Armenian defence ministers as well as  pro-Armenian separatist forces fighting to prise the enclave from Azeri  administration.
The area has a largely Armenian population but falls within Azerbajian.
The accord was due to have come into effect overnight but a spokesman for  the Armenian rebels in the province told AFP there had been merely a  photocopied exchange of propositions Wednesday on a possible laying down of  arms.
Armenia's defence minister meanwhile told AFP that Yerevan was in no way  party to a decision.
Karabakh troops accused Azerbaijan of launching an attack Thursday on the  back of intensive artillery bombardments around Agdam, just beyond the eastern  edge of the disputed enclave and now under Armenian control.
ITAR-TASS quoted the Azeri minister of defence as saying Baku's forces had  for more than 24 hours been engaged in clashes with the aim of retaking two  villages in northern Karabakh.
A spokesman for the Russian foreign ministry called on the warring parties  to "respect scrupulously" the reported ceasefire agreement but also questioned  the willingness of their political masters to seek a peaceful solution.
Many earlier ceasefire accords have been broken in the conflict which has  claimed more than 20,000 lives since fighting broke out in February 1988.
Peace talks chaired by the inter-parliamentary assembly of the  Commonwealth of Independent States failed last week in Kirghizstan.
