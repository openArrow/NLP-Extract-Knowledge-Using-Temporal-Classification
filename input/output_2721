North Korea has agreed to the visit of a new  high-level mission of the International Atomic Energy agency (IAEA) to discuss  the removal of fuel rods from its Yongbyon nuclear complex, the IAEA announced  Saturday.
The mission which is composed of senior safeguards officials will leave  Vienna Sunday and arrive in North Korea Tuesday.
North Korea "expressed readiness to receive an Agency consultation team,"  the statement added, referring to a North Korean telex received here Saturday.
"The team will aim to clarify means of implementing the requisite  safeguards measures in the Experimental Power Reactor."
The IAEA said late Thursday that North Korea had begun extracting fuel  rods from its five-megawatt Yongbyon reactor in a "serious violation" of IAEA  inspection terms and said it would inform the UN Security Council.
On Friday the agency rejected a North Korean proposal to keep fuel rods  from the controversial nuclear reactor in a "safe place under seal" ahead of  resumed talks on the issue.
"That won't work. We will no longer be able to verify with certainty if  any of the nuclear material has been diverted," an agency official said.
