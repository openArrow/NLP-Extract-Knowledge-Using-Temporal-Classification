The German government has cancelled an early  June bond issue because it has sufficient funds, the Bundesbank said Tuesday.
According to its calendar, the government was to have issued a bond "in  the first 10 days of June."
In its latest monthly report, the Bundesbank pointed to the government's  healthy level of funds, which in April showed a surplus of 12 billion marks,  compared to 4.5 billion marks in the same month in 1993.
