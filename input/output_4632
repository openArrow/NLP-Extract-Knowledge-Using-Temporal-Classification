A South African woman woke up  as hospital staff were getting her body ready for the morgue three hours after  declaring her dead, the domestic SAPA news agency reported Friday.
Maria Botha, 66, who was in a coma when she arrived at the hospital  Thursday, was fitted with a pacemaker.
She was deemed to have died in the intensive care unit when "her pupils no  no longer reacted, she was cold and blue and the machine monitoring her  heartbeats showed a steady line," her daughter Alma Nel said.
A priest recited a funerary prayer and Botha's family left the Greenacres  hospital in Port Elizabeth to make burial arrangements.
Three hours later, hospital staff told Nel her mother was alive after all.  "When I went back, she gave a weak smile and said she was feeling dizzy," Nel  said.
