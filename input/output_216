Danish Interior and Immigration Minister Birte  Weiss said Friday she asked Albania, Hungary and Slovenia for authorisation to  set up Danish-run camps for refugees from former Yugoslavia on their  territories.
In a note to parliament, Weiss said there was no agreement so far to the  requests, made in April, but that the government was continuing to seek an  accord with the three countries.
Denmark runs a refugee camp in Bosnia-Hercegovina amd another in Croatia  but the Croatian authorities last month refused to allow Denmark to set up  another one there.
Denmark has also offered shelter for some 18,000 refugees from  ex-Yugoslavia but believes haven should be provided as close as possible to  home to facilitate return and to cut government spending.
