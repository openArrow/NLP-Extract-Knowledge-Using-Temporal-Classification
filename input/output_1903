Indonesia threatened Thursday to scrap a meeting  between Filipino Moslem rebels and Manila representatives in Jakarta if the  Philippines failed to block a planned conference on East Timor.
"It will be definitely postponed if, between now and June, this  disappointment (about the East Timor conference) is not addressed in a proper  way," foreign ministry spokesman Irawan Abidin told AFP.
He was referring to a meeting arranged by Indonesia between the Philippine  government and a Moslem separatist group, the Moro National Liberation Front  (MNLF), scheduled to be held in mid-June.
Jakarta is angry about a private seminar on human rights on East Timor,  the former Portuguese colony annexed by Indonesia in 1976. The seminar is due  to be held in Manila from May 31 to June 3.
The warning came only a day after Indonesia said it expected the talks to  go ahead. A government negotiator in Manila said earlier Thursday that the  peace talks would go on, even if Jakarta cancelled its hosting of the meeting.
The Manila seminar is being organised by non-government organisations.
According to human rights groups, tens of thousands of people have been  killed since Indonesia seized East Timor in 1975. The United Nations does not  recognise Indonesian sovereignty over the territory, and calls for its people  to have the right to self-determination.
The MNLF waged a bloody campaign for a separate Moslem state in the  southern Philippines in the 1970s but has since been weakened by internal  strife and declining overseas support. It has since agreed to a ceasefire with  Manila in order to negotiate for autonomy for Moslem-populated regions.
The Philippines government says it cannot ban the Manila seminar, under  constitutional guarantees of free speech.
