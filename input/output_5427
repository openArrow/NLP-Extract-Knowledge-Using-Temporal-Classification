Five contracts valued at almost 800 million Hong  Kong dollars (100 million US) were awarded here Monday for the territory's new  airport, including construction of a 1.2 kilometer-long (0.7 mile) passenger  terminal.
Gammon-Nishimatsu Joint Venture of Hong Kong and Japan was awarded a 465  million Hong Kong dollar contract to lay foundations for the passenger  terminal, the Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) announced.
The other key contracts awarded Monday, valued together at 320 million  Hong Kong dollars, included:
Leighton-Lama Joint Venture of Hong Kong/Australia and South Africa for a  raw water submarine pipeline.
China Fujian - Downer McAlpine Joint Venture of China and  Australia/Britain for temporary utilities, roads and bridges.
Shun Shing Construction and Engineering Co. Ltd. of Hong Kong for initial  workforce accommodation, employer's office and contractors' transit office.
Universal Dockyard Ltd. of Hong Kong for temporary ferry piers and  berthing structures.
China, which will take over control of the colony in 1997, has objected to  overspending at the airport and has held up financing, but the PAA said  funding for these contracts was approved by Hong Kong's Legislative Council in  January. The contracts are also within the PAA's budget for these items, it  added.
