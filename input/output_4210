Europe tried to lay to rest the ghosts of wars past  on Thursday with a Stability Pact intended to settle potential border disputes  and solve the problem of minorities in central and eastern Europe.
But the conference on stability in Europe, brainchild of French Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur, left aside the wars in Bosnia and the Caucasus,  concentrating on preventing conflicts that could regenerate from Europe's  turbulent past.
And Europe's future relationship with Russia, which will not be part of  the pact, appeared ill-defined as the two-day conference opened at UNESCO  headquarters here.
In an opening speech, Balladur said "we must begin by liquidating the old  quarrels, resolving the old conflicts, dissipating the old fears, we must  stabilise our continent as far as borders and minority rights are concerned."
The prime minister said the conference's objective should be to sign the  Stability Pact by early next year, perhaps in February "but perhaps it will  take longer."
A successful outcome would help Balladur in French presidential elections  due in May, 1995, analysts said, but the Stability Pact project is less  ambitious than when the prime minister launched it a year ago.
It is now limited to preventing potential conflict. The war in Bosnia,  said Balladur, "is a veritable lesson of what we must no longer tolerate."
The pact would incorporate existing good-neighbour agreements, such as  recognition of the Oder-Neisse frontier between Germany and Poland, and new  accords to be reached in the interval, Balladur said.
The aim of the pact was to reconcile the desire of "numerous countries to  join the European Union with the need to preserve the unity of our continent  and thus develop very close relations with Russia," the prime minister said.
He added that the "greater Europe of the future" should enjoy "privileged  relations of partnership" with Moscow.
Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev welcomed the proposed pact, but  struck a note of caution, saying that Moscow preferred that border disputes  and minority issues be addressed by the Conference on Security and Cooperation  in Europe (CSCE).
He hailed the pact as "yet another attempt to come to grips seriously with  the extremely dangerous signs of aggressive nationalism, xenophobia and ethnic  and religious intolerance" in Europe.
But he added, "discussion of issues related to state borders as well as to  national minorities should take place exclusively in the framework established  by CSCE documents."
Balladur also said Thursday the future pact would be closely linked with  the CSCE.
The United States is represented at the conference by Undersecretary of  State for Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff.
The conference is chaired by Greece in its capacity as current president  of the EU after the union adopted Balladur's initiative.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said this week that the summit aimed  to settle border and minority problems between "countries with the vocation of  entering the EU," following the collapse of the Soviet bloc.
They are six central and eastern European countries -- Poland, the Czech  Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania -- and the three Baltic  countries - Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Only one country that emerged from  former Yugoslavia - Slovenia - has been invited.
French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure said the EU, while  prepared to accept new members, was unwilling to take on board "new sources of  conflict." The aim was to "provide a political impetus" to handle  good-neighbour problems "better and quicker," Juppe said.
On the agenda are the big Hungarian minorities in Romania (1.6 million)  and Slovakia (600,000).
Budapest is anxious to protect their rights to autonomy, notably in the  cultural field, while the Romanian and Slovakian governments are seeking  Hungarian acceptance of the inviolability of existing frontiers.
The conference will also attempt to deal with the problem of Russian  minorities in the three Baltic countries and the withdrawal of Russian troops.
The four candidate members of the EU -- Finland, Norway, Sweden and Austria  -- are  attending the Paris conference, along with the three neighbours of the  central European Visegrad group -- Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine.
Apart from Russia and the United States, eight other states with a direct  interest in European stability are also taking part -- Albania, Canada,  Cyprus, Iceland, Malta, Switzerland, Turkey and the Vatican.
