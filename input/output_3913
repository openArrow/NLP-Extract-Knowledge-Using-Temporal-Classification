The Taiwanese dollar lost nearly 15 cents against  the US dollar on Wednesday to close at 27.105 cents, a record plunge from the  26.75 recorded in January 1991, currency dealers said.
Following the previous day's depreciation to 26.959 cents, the local unit  got off to a losing start and further plunged to the intra-session low of  27.12, spurred by strong buying of the greenback by local importers, they said.
The recent slump of the local unit was triggered by a shrinkage in  Taiwan's trade surplus and first quarte economic growth of 5.4 percent,  dealers said, adding that a cheaper Taiwan dollar would help increase  competitiveness.
In the first three months, the export-orientated island's trade surplus  fell by 82 percent from the figure a year earlier to 240 million US dollars,  the lowest quarterly level for 13 years.
"Although the central bank tried to slow down the depreciation rate, the  buying spree of the US dollar accelerated the downswing of the Taiwan dollar,"  said Tarsicio Tong, chief dealer at the Banque Nationale de Paris.
Tong forecast that the Taiwanese dollar might hit the 27.2 mark for one  US dollar in the short term, adding that the local unit had lost 1.3 percent  over the past three weeks.
Outgoing Central Bank Governor Samuel Shieh interpreted the fall of the  Taiwan dollar as a normal reflection of market reaction to a dwindling foreign  trade surplus and current account here.
