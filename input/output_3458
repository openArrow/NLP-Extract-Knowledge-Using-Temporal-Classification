Russian writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn will stay in  Vladivostok for a few days after flying into that far eastern port Friday when  he returns to Russia after a 20-year exile, the ITAR-TASS agency said Tuesday.
It said Solzhenitsyn would arrive Friday afternoon in Vladivostok from  Anchorage, Alaska, on board an Alaska Airlines plane. The flight will make two  stopovers en route to the port, at Magadan, a former prison camp, and  Khabarovsk, both also in Russia's far east, north of Vladivostok.
The former dissident, 75, will travel with his wife and two of his sons,  and hopes to meet local people and fishermen in Vladivostok, which is the home  port of Russia's Pacific Fleet and was still a closed city until a few years  ago.
From Vladivostok, the writer, a Nobel prize winner and author of such  noted works at the "Gulag Archipelago," is to start a journey across Russia to  see the changes in the country and its people since he was banished from the  former Soviet Union in 1974 after being stripped of his citizenship.
His Soviet passport was restored in 1990 following the wave of reforms in  the old Eastern bloc, and he will return home on a Russian passport.
Though Solzhenitsyn was said to make a quiet return home, ITAR-TASS said  hundreds of Russian and foreign journalists were expected in Vladivostok to be  on hand for his arrival.
The reclusive writer has lived in a quiet corner of the US state of  Vermont since 1976.
It was expected to take several weeks for him to return to Moscow, where  an apartment has been made available for him pending construction of a country  house outside the Russian capital.
