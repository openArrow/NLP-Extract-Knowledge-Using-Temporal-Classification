France's Jacobin Yoma kept his  European Boxing Union super-featherweight title here on Saturday night after  stopping British challenger Neil Haddock in the seventh round.
Haddock's corner threw in the towel after their man was comprehensively  outpunched by the 28-year-old Frenchman fighting before his home crowd. The  Englishman had also suffered badly from the stifling heat.
Yoma was making the third defence of a title he won in June, 1993 with a  points win here over Dutchman Regilio Tuur.
