The French AOM airline said Tuesday it was making an  official complaint to the European Commission in a bid to win broader access  to London's Heathrow airport.
"Since October 1993, AOM has unsuccessfully requested that British  authorities grant it time slots to give it real access to air transport market  between Paris-Orly and London-Heathrow," the company said in a statement.
It acknowledged it had earlier been offered two slots, but said these did  not allow for commercial exploitation of the service.
AOM said it was effectively being barred from Heathrow in an infringement  of EU legislation.
On Tuesday, the French government agreed to allow British Airways to offer  four daily flights between Orly and Heathrow as of June 13 in line with an  earlier ruling by the EU commission.
So far, only British Airways, its French subsidiary TAT and Air France  have been allocated time slots allowing them to offer the new service.
Another private company, Air Liberte, has also threatened to officially  complain to Brussels to gain access to Heathrow, Europe's busiest airport.
