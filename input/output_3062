Six people who said they were  relatives of the man charged with killing Mexico's leading presidential  candidate crossed the US border Sunday seeking political asylum, officials  said.
The group included three children and a woman who said she was the mother  of Mario Aburto Colosio, who gunned down the ruling Institutional  Revolutionary Party's candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio March 23.
The US Customs Border Patrol said it was holding the group in San Diego  and was trying to confirm their identity. Spokeswoman Ann Summers said they  were not carrying any identification and were seeking US asylum.
"They indicated that they had been harassed by various individuals. They  didn't point any fingers at anyone, but they did say Mexican authorities had  taken various documentation away from them, including the deed to the house,"  she said.
Rumors of conspiracy have been circulating since Aburto shot Colosio at  the political rally where he was hired by the PRI to work the security detail.
