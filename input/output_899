Experts here generally agree that the Federal  Reserve will raise US short-term interest rates at a meeting here Tuesday --  but they are divided on the scale of the increase.
Some, including former Federal Reserve governor Wayne Angell, believe that  when the US central bank's policy-making Open Market Committee meets Tuesday  it will raise the overnight interbank rate from 3.75 percent to 4.25 percent  and the discount rate from 3.00 percent to 3.50 percent.
That view is shared by Paul Mastrodi of investment bank JP Morgan.
"For the market, less than 50 basis points would be a disappointment,"  Mastrodi said.
But others, such as Chris Iggo of Chase Manhattan Bank and Stuart Hoffman  of PNC Bank Corp. are forecasting a quarter percent increase for the overnight  rate to 4.00 percent, with a half percent rise for the discount rate to 3.50  percent.
They point out that while the Fed has raised the overnight rate three  times since February, each time by 0.25 percent, the discount rate has not so  far been increased.
But whatever level of increase they are forecasting, experts basically  agree that the US economy is strong enough to absorb what will be the fourth  increase for the overnight rate since February after five years of falling  rates.
"The economy is quite strong and four percent is not high by any means,"  Mastrodi said.
The first three increases in the overnight rate have not yet had any  visible effect on orders or sales, and demand remains strong, according to  reports published Thursday by the National Association of Manufacturers and  the Business Council.
These two groups, which represent leading US businesses, are expecting US  economic growth for this year at above three percent.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen is also optimistic, saying Friday he was  increasingly confident that the economy would show better growth in 1994 than  the three percent forecast by the government in January.
