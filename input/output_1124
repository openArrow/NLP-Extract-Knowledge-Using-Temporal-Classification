Northern Yemeni troops Monday took the rival south's  main air base at al-Anad, opening the way for a push towards the southern  capital Aden, some 50 kilometres (30 miles) to the south, an AFP photographer  on the spot said.
As the northern soldiers consolidated, opposition parties led by  vice-president Ali Salem al-Baid, the southern leader, announced here early  Tuesday they would form a High Council for National Salvation.
Abdel Rahman al-Jifri, who chairs a bloc of five opposition parties, told  AFP the council would function wherever it had influence, not just in southern  Yemen.
"In no way does this mean the formation of a government of South Yemen,"  Jifri said.
He said the decision to form a High Council was prompted by the  constitutional vacuum and the illegality of the political institutions in the  country.
Around 50 northerners were patrolling the perimeter of the al-Anad air  base Monday and the junction of the two main roads to the northern capital  Sanaa, an AFP photographer said.
Backed by tanks, artillery and anti-aircraft batteries, they took up  position around 3:30 p.m. (1230 GMT), cutting off southern troops further  north.
The official north Yemeni news agency SABA reported Monday afternoon that  the base had fallen to northern troops, who were mopping up resistance inside  the base.
