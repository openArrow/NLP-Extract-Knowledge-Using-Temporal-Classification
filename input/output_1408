A group of Israeli soldiers bade  farewell to Gaza City on Tuesday with a last drink with Palestinian fishermen  at the Mediterranean port.
The six soldiers, walking along the seafront, were invited to a soft drink  on the docks. After talking politics, the fishermen and Israelis said goodbye  and shook hands.
"It's good for them and it's good for us. I'm happy to be leaving," one of  the soldiers told an AFP photographer.
In the city itself, Gaza youths gathered to taunt Israeli soldiers for a  last time, but found themselves being dispersed by the new Palestinian police  force.
Israeli forces were expected to complete their redeployment on the Gaza  Strip, leaving the police in charge of order in all but the 20 Jewish  settlements of the self-rule territory.
