A majority of French people would support a boycott  of Italy's neo-fascist ministers by European Union countries, according to a  poll released Tuesday.
The survey, carried out by the CSA polling institute for the weekly La  Vie, showed 54 per cent of French people backed a boycott with 28 percent  against.
Exactly half the sample of 1,000 people questioned regarded Italy's new  government led by media magnate Silvio Berlusconi as "demagogic and populist,"  compared with 18 percent who disagreed.
But 37 percent believed Berlusconi could "redress the situation" in Italy.
In addition, 68 percent thought there was a real risk neo-fascism could  become a political force across Europe.
Berlusconi's new cabinet includes five members of the neo-fascist National  Alliance.
