Malawi's President-elect Bakili Muluzi has  confounded expectations by picking former top civil servant Justin Malewezi as  his vice president, state radio said late Friday.
The radio announced the appointment a day before Muluzi is due to be sworn  in as head of state.
It was widely belived that Muluzi would pick Aleke Banda, a former top  aide of outgoing president Hastings Kamuzu Banda, for the post.
Malewezi, who was defeated in the election by a Malawi Congress Party  candidate, was a former secretary to the influential office of the president  and cabinet under Banda.
"He is probably the man who best knows government administration," said an  analyst soon after the announcement, interpreting the appointment as a  balancing act by Muluzi because Malewezi comes from a region known to be a  Congress Party stronghold.
Malewezi fell out of favour with Banda's government after reportedly  refusing to carry out the ousted head of state's orders.
Muluzi, expected to announce his cabinet after the swearing-in ceremony,  won Tuesday's presidential poll ahead of three other contenders including  Banda.
