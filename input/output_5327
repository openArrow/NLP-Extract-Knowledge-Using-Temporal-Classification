Talks between Somalia's warring factions scheduled  to open here on Monday have been postponed for the fourth time in two months,  a UN official said.
A new date for the talks will be announced later, after further  consultations between the United Nations and the Somali groups, said Huntley  Anderson, an official of the UN operation in Somalia (UNOSOM).
The decision to postpone the negotiations was taken at a UN officials'  meeting held here during the weekend and on Monday and attended by the UN  secretary-general's special representative to Somalia Lansana Kouyate.
Anderson could not give details on the reasons for the postponement.
"We want to make sure the meal is well cooked before serving it," he said.
The talks, to prepare the ground for a national peace and reconciliation  conference, were proposed after Somalia's two chief warlords, Mohamed Farah  Aidid and self-styled interim president Ali Mahdi Mohamed, signed a  UN-brokered national reconciliation agreement in Nairobi in March.
