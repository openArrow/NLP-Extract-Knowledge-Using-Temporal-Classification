Kmart, the second largest discount store  chain, reported first quarter earnings of 18 million dollars, down from 23  million dollars a year ago.
The earnings figures include a one-time charge for the sale of its Pace  Club stores and Payless drug stores. Excluding the charge, its earnings were  58 milion dollars.
First quarter sales were 7.81 billion dollars against 7.35 billion dollars  a year earlier.
Pre-tax profits was 25.5 percent of sales compared to 25.7 percent because  of lower sales than planned.
Kmart currently has 4,000 stores in the United States under the names  Kmart, Builders Square, OfficeMax, Sports Authority, Borders and Waldenbooks.
"While strong results were realized in our specialty store businesses,  sales throughout much of the first quarter, especially in April, were below  plan in the US Kmart store division," said Kmart chief executive Joseph  Antonini.
Kmart, which has stores in the United States and Canada, plans to expand  to Mexico and Singapore in 1994. Last year, it opened stores in the Czech and  Slovak republics and it also owns a share of Coles Myer, the principal store  chain in Australia.
