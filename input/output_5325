China's summer wheat harvest this year will top  110 million tonnes, falling about five million tonnes short of the 1993  figure, the China Daily reported Monday.
The drop has been caused by a chronic drought in northern China, the  encroachment on arable land by local development projects and neglect of the  agricultural sector during the economic boom of recent years.
The report, quoting officials at a recent national meeting, said summer  crop area totalled some 3.8 million acres this year, down 466,700 hectares on  1993.
The officials nevertheless said the forecast for wheat and other summer  crops was better than had been expected because of recent rainfall in the  drought-hit north as well as new moves to increase in agricultural investment  and improve field management.
Reacting to rising discontent among farmers, the government has in the  past year repeatedly pledged to focus more attention on the agricultural  sector and prevent the further reduction in arable acreage.
An agricultural official said recently that the government would make  further efforts to boost production, perfect the grain reserve system and  grant preferential policies to the country's 500 main grain-producing counties  to ensure the country's continued ability to feed itself.
State grain reserve administration director Bai Meiqing, addressing the  meeting, urged all purchasing departments to buy as much grain as possible to  build up state reserves.
The government has in recent months moved to control grain prices -- which  surged 40 percent in November and December -- by reimposing ceilings and  building up reserves to use to balance the market.
Bai also pledged farmers would be paid in cash for their crops this  summer, after widespread issuing of IOUs last year sparked several violent  protests in the countryside.
"No IOU notes is permitted to pay farmers during the purchasing," he said.
