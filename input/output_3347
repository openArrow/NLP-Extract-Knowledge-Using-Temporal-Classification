Colombia's Nobel Prize-winning author Gabriel Garcia Marquez, says the  game is an important cultural touchstone for the country, which makes the  national team's success all the more important.
"We were always an elegant team," he says. "We learned from Brazil and  Argentina, but we did not know how to score goals. Now, we know."
President Cesar Gaviria awarded Maturana the Boyaca Cross, the highest  medal civilians can receive, after the qualifying campaign,
But the frenzy sparked by the team's success had a dark side.
Their 2-1 win at home to Argentina in August set off mayhem which resulted  in 28 deaths around the country.
The 5-0 victory over Argentina in the return leg reportedly led to 78  deaths in post-match incidents.
An even longer shadow was cast over the team by the arrest of goalkeeper  Rene Higuita, one of the most colourful players in the 1990 finals, for his  role in a drug trade-related kidnapping.
The extrovert keeper, whose forays upfield brought both success and  catastrophe, was released in December but he was not included in the squad  announced on May 17.
