Defence officials from Armenia and Azerbaijan began  consultations here on Monday about the embattled Nagorno-Karabakh enclave  under Russian mediation, in a new bid to set up official negotiations for a  peace settlement.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy Vladimir Kazimirov said  the idea was to bring the parties together and arrange for formal talks to  reach a final agreement covering an overall ceasefire, withdrawal of troops  and the stationing of a peace force from the Commonwealth of Independent  States accompanied by international observers.
Russia and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe have been  trying since February to get Armenia and Azerbaijan to accept the package.
Kazimirov and the CSCE's Swedish envoy Jan Eliasson spent last week in the  two countries and in the enclave, which is Azerbaijani territory but under  Armenian control. More than 20,000 people have been killed in six years of  fighting.
