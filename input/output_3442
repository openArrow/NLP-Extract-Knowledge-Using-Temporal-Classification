Four people died as a Ferrari sports car  crashed into a parked official vehicle during the third day of the Cannonball  Run on a main highway south of here Tuesday.
The Ferrari F40, which had clocked the fastest times on the first two  days, ran off the road on a sweeping bend, skidded on gravel and rammed the  other vehicle at a checkpoint 95km (60 miles) south of Alice Springs.
The Ferrari driver, unofficially identified as Akihiro Kabe, a Japanese  dentist, died instantly along with his co-driver and two race officials in the  checkpoint vehicle.
Police said names were being withheld until relatives were informed.
About 140 cars, some of which had been reaching 300kmh (187mph) on  unrestricted roads, were racing from Darwin to the landmark Ayers Rock in  central Australia and back.
Northern Territory was chosen by race organisers because it has the only  roads in Australia without speed limits.
Race director Allan Moffat will decide on Friday whether the race should  continue. Wednesday is a scheduled rest day.
The Automobile Association (AA) of the Northern Territory predicted it  would be the last of its kind because of the tragedy.
"There will have to be a reassessment," AA local manager Malcolm Pash  said. "I think you will find it will be the first and last race."
