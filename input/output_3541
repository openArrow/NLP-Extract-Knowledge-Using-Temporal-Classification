Eighth-seeded Gabriela Sabatini's nightmare  continued at the French Open Tennis Championships here on Tuesday when she was  beaten in the first round by Italy's plucky Silvia Farina.
She was the fourth seed to be beaten in the women's event.
Earlier sixth-seeded Kimiko Date of Japan went out in straight-sets to  Amanda Coetzer of South Africa. On Monday fourth-seeded Martina Navratilova  and number thirteen Magdalena Maleeva were frogmarched out of the  Championships without winning a set.
Sabatini, who was 24 last week, has not won a title since the 1992 Italian  Open. And her latest reverse, on her favourite surface, must raise new  questionmarks over her future.
Farina, 22 and modestly ranked at 103rd, refused to surrender after the  South American had pocketed the first set.
And as she surged back on an overcast day when rain had delayed the start,  the brightest thing for Sabatini on the number-one show court was her  fluorescent red, yellow and blue racket.
The heavy conditions should have been ideal for the South American, who  was making her tenth attempt to win the event after being a semi-finalist on  no fewer than five occasions.
At the start Sabatini stood her ground in a gruelling baseline duel and  appeared to take the edge off Farina's attacks as she went 3-0 up after  fifteen minutes and went on to pocket the first set.
But the Italian picked up her game, took increasing risks by coming into  the net, and stifled Sabatini's baseline defences with a series of neat  volleys.
