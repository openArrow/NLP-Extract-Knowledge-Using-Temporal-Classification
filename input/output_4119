The Asian Development Bank (ADB) Thursday announced  formal approval of a 100 percent general capital increase to about 48 billion  dollars following this month's annual meeting on new loan conditions.
China, which objected strongly to new US-proposed conditions, such as  "good governance," abstained from the postal vote among 55 ADB member  countries, while war-torn Afghanistan failed to cast its ballot, bank  spokesman Maurice Bauche said.
He said the new conditions -- including greater emphasis on social and  environmental projects -- will continue to be discussed by the Manila-based  ADB's 12-member executive board, and there was no indication when a resolution  would be reached.
Bank president Mitsuo Sato announced at the May 3 to May 5 annual meeting  in Nice, France, that enough members had approved the capital increase to  guarantee its ratification.
