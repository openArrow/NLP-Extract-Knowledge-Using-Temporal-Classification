It reached a weekly high of 5,675 dollars per tonne, rising only 50  dollars from the Friday close, before ending the week around 5,600 dollars per  tonne.
The director of the International Tin Research Institute (ITRI), Dr. B.  Barry, said at international conference in Jakarta that demand could increase  by 35-45,000 tonnes per year in the next decade as a result of new  developments in the usage of tin from the ITRI.
