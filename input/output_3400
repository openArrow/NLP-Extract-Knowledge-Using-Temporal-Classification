Four people were killed Tuesday as a  Ferrari, reportedly driven by a Japanese dentist, crashed during the inaugural  Cannonball Run car race near Alice Springs, police said here.
The driver of the Ferrari and his co-driver died instantly as the car spun  out of control at a checkpoint, slamming into two race officials before  hitting two control cars, police superintendant Terry Ey said.
The name of the Ferrari driver was not immediately released as police  tried to contact relatives of the victims.
The crash happened about 95 kilometres (60 miles) south of Alice Springs  in Australia's Northern Territory, whose roads are not subject to speed limits.
Ey said the rally was proceeding despite the tragedy.
The five-day event, billed as a grand prix of the open highway, involves  about 140 cars, some of which have been reaching speeds of up to 300  kilometres (187 miles) per hour.
It covers the 3,400 kilometre (2,120 mile) return trip from Darwin to the  landmark Ayers Rock in central Australia.
The race, which started on Sunday, is named after a 1970s hit movie of the  same name about an illegal car race across the United States.
The Northern Territory has the only roads in Australia where no speed  limits exist, although organisers said some sectors of the race would be  restricted.
