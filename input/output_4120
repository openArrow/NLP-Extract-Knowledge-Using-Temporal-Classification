Japan's household spending in March fell 4.3 percent  from a year earlier to 353,908 yen (3,403 dollars), the second consecutive  monthly decline, the Management and Coordination Agency said Thursday.
The fall followed a 0.5 percent loss in February after four straight  months of gains from October to January.
The agency said it recorded the second consecutive yearly fall in the  fiscal year ended March 31, with the average family spending 335,379 yen  (3,225 dollars) a month, 0.6 percent down from the previous year.
The agency attributed the decline to continued weak consumer spending,  adding that lower income resulting from the recession discouraged families to  spend on durable goods.
