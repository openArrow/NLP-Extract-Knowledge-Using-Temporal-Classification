Former Italian premier Bettino Craxi, who has been  asked to surrender his passport to authorities, will appear before judges  investigating him for alleged corruption before the end of next week, his  attorney Enzo Lo Giudice said Friday.
"He will come back, you can rest assured he will come back before the end  of next week," Lo Giudice said about his client whose whereabouts are unknown.
He added that Craxi could be overseas but said he did not know where.
He said he spoke with him by telephone Thursday evening but Craxi did not  disclose his location.
The former socialist premier, who is under investigation in 20 separate  cases of alleged corruption, faces an international arrest warrant if he does  not appear soon before judges in Milan wishing to question him.
He was recently sighted on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris where he  owns an apartment. He also is a regular visitor to Hammamet in Tunisia where  his wife is officially resident.
