Four strong earthquakes under the Aegean Sea shook  Greek islands for the second day running Tuesday, sending panic-stricken  residents into the streets, the Athens observatory said.
The latest tremors, measuring 6.1, 5.7 and 5.0 and 4.9 degrees on the  Richter scale, occurred at 0205, 0215, 0336 and 0605 GMT. All had their  epicentre in the same spot under the Aegean Sea some 240 kilometres (150  miles) (Eds: correct) northeast of Athens.
They were felt especially on the islands of Chios and Lesbos, as well as  in Athens. The tremors caused no casualties and only minor damage, notably  cracks in older houses, authorities said.
The shock waves also shook the Izmir region on the Turkey's western coast  and were felt as far away as Istanbul, the Kandilli Seismological Institute in  Istanbul said.
An earthquake measuring 6.1 degrees shook the island of Crete, further  south, on Monday, causing slight damage.
