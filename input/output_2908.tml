But with all 23 films in competition <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE">now</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e3" class="I_STATE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">viewed</EVENT>, observers <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">stress</EVENT> that  jury decisions are notoriously unpredictable, and that a surprise winner  cannot be <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="NEG" modality="can">ruled</EVENT> out.&#13;
"There really is nothing absolutely outstanding, in the league of 'Piano'  or "Concubine' <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE">last year</TIMEX3>," <EVENT eid="e6" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT> one critic, <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">referring</EVENT> to <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE">last year</TIMEX3>'s joint  Palm winners by New Zealander Jane Campion and China's Chen Kaige.&#13;
"There are a number of films which could easily be <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="could">pulled</EVENT> from the  envelope on <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME">Monday night</TIMEX3>," he <EVENT eid="e9" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">added</EVENT>.&#13;
The main contender, <EVENT eid="e10" class="REPORTING" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">according</EVENT> to the critics, is Polish filmmaker  Krzysztof Kieslowski's "Three Colours Red," the final part of his tricolour  cinematic trilogy <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">following</EVENT> "Blue" and "White."&#13;
In a running poll in 'Moving Pictures' magazine, published here daily and  <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">putting</EVENT> together critical ratings from around the world, the film is the only  one to <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">score</EVENT> an average of eight out of 10.&#13;
The top prize for Kieslowski would <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="would">bring</EVENT> him an unprecedented triple win:  the previous parts of the trilogy have already <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">picked</EVENT> up the top prizes at the  Venice and Berlin film festivals.&#13;
But "Red" is not on its own. Of the films still in the running, Chinese  filmmaker Zhang Yimou's "To Live," has been widely <EVENT eid="e16" class="PERCEPTION" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">seen</EVENT> as the next strongest  contender, followed by Italian Nanni Moretti's "Dear Diary."&#13;
The two films <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">score</EVENT> 7.5 and 7 respectively in 'Moving Pictures'' poll of  critics.&#13;
