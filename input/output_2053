Iranian naval forces have begun land and sea  manoeuvres in northern Gulf, a newspaper said here Thursday.
The four-day exercise, code-named "Nasre-2", is aimed at "enhancing combat  capability and maintaining a constant presence in the country's territorial  waters," the daily Etellaat said.
The first day of manoeuvres on Wednesday involved reconnaissance  operations, troop concentrations and the movement of military units on the  mock-enemy's land, it said.
Some 40 war games have been scheduled to take place in Gulf waters between  March 1994 and March 1995, according to military sources.
