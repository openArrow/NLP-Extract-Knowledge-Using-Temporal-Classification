The dollar remained fragile as a decision on US  interest rates was awaited on Tuesday, and the drachma was again supported by  a sharp rise in rates.
Dealers in the dollar were waiting to see if the open market committee of  the US Federal Reserve would increase interest rates later in the day.
The dollar fell to 1.6710 marks from 1.6730 at the close on Monday and to  104.65 yen from 104.85.
"The market is very calm ahead of the meeting of the US Federal Reserve,"  Bank of America analyst Jeremy Hawkins said.
He said that the fall of the dollar had been caused by "market worries  that the Fed might only raise interest rates a quarter of a point instead of  half a point as dealers expect".
He said: "If interest rates only lift 0.25 percent, the dollar will fall."  He believed that the Fed was aware of this danger and would lift rates by 0.5  percent.
The drachma opened here unchanged at 148.10 drachma to the mark but fell  to 148.30 by mid morning.
In Athens interbank rates rose sharply for the second consecutive day.
"The situation of the drachma remains quiet on a big increase in rates,"  the head dealer at Citibank in Greece, Yorgo Kondoyannis said.
The interbank overnight rate rose up to 150 percent on Tuesday.
The drachma was marked slightly down to 148.80 to the mark from 148.08 on  Monday and to 248.30 to the dollar from 247.97.
On Monday the central bank had increased its overdraft rate for banks by  three points to 33 percent. This, together with daily surcharges, means that  banks are now being charged an annual rate of 180 percent. On Friday the rate  was 30 percent.
The Greek government had decided at the weekend to advance by six weeks  the date for liberalisation of capital flows. The decree enacting this was  published on Tuesday, but the documents with details of how it is to be  applied, and which might include restrictions, had not been received by banks.
The drachma survived almost unscathed on Monday, but speculation was  resumed late in the day. Dealers said that although the credibility of the  drachma was seriously in question, they thought that European central banks  might support the currency.
The increase in interest rates and liberalisation of capital flows had  enabled the Greek central bank to avoid intervention this week, Hawkins said  in London. Last week it had spent about one billion dollars in supporting the  currency.
Hawkins believed, like many other analysts, that the Greek government was  waiting for the end of its period in the presidency of the European Union  council of ministers and until elections to the European Parliament before  either devaluing the drachma or allowing it to fall by degrees.
The mark continued to fall against the French franc to 3.4281 French  francs compared with 3.4297 on Monday and 3.4315 on Friday, while the lira  remained stable at 961.8 lire to the mark from 961.5.
The pound lost ground after recent rises and before a batch of economic  statistics on Wednesday, falling to 1.5020 dollars from 1.5030 at the close on  Monday, to 2.5107 marks from 2.514, to 157.24 yen from 157.59, to 2.1415 Swiss  francs from 2.1433, and to 8.6074 French francs from 8.6253.
The dollar was at 1.6710 marks from 1.6730, at 104.65 yen from 104.85, at  1.4253 Swiss francs from 1.4260, and at 5.7288 French francs from 5.7388.
In Paris, the market was also calm, with the currencies slightly lower,  before the meeting of the US Federal Reserve.
By mid morning, the dollar was being traded at 5.7292 French francs from  5.7388 at the close on Monday, at 1.6713 marks from 1.6730, and at 104.63 yen  from 104.85.
The mark was at 3.4284 French francs from 3.4285. Sterling declined to  8.6040 French francs from 8.6253.
