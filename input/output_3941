Nigel Mansell has pledged his immediate future to  Indy-car racing, dashing speculation that he is about to return to the  Williams-Renault Formula One team to replace the late Ayrton Senna.
The current Indy-car champion said: "There are no specific talks at the  moment about me going back to Formula One.
"There is no chance of me taking part in the British Grand Prix this year  because it clashes with our own race in Cleveland.
"I could fit in some racing in Europe but not necessarily in Formula One.
"My overriding focus is in America at the moment and I won't worry about  next season until I've defended my world championship over here."
The 40-year-old English ex-Formula One world champion's immediate sights  on winning this weekend's Indianapolis 500 race, one of his last ambitions.
Mansell told the Daily Mail newspaper: "I will give my all at Indianapolis.
"Then I will commit myself to defending my title through the remaining 12  races of the Indy-car season. The rest is fairytales."
Carl Haas, co-boss with film star Paul Newman of the Indy-car team which  has Mansell under contract, said of Mansell's possible return to the Grand  Prix circuit: "I don't think it is a good idea at all."
Haas said the serious injuries to Portugese driver Pedro Lamy in an  accident at the Silverstone track in England on Tuesday had made him even more  reluctant to contemplate such a move.
He added: "Nigel has spoken to me briefly about it but he is contracted  with us for 1994 and 1995 and we are not keen to release him."
Bernie Ecclestone, the president of the Formula One Constructors'  Association (FOCA), accepted Haas' standpoint but added: "There is enough  space on the calendar to do a couple of races."
