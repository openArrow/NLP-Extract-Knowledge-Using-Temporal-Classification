Texas-based Electronic Data Systems Corp. (EDS)  said Friday it had purchased New Zealand's Databank Systems from its four bank  owners for an undisclosed sum.
Analysts' estimates of Databank's value ranged up to 100 million New  Zealand dollars (57 million US dollars).
Databank, formerly owned by the ANZ bank, Bank of New Zealand, National  Bank of New Zealand and Westpac, was set up as the banks' clearing house in  1967.
EDS has also been tipped as the most likely buyer for GCS, the  corporatised former Government Computing Service.
EDS senior vice-president Jeff Heller declined to comment directly on a  possible purchase of GCS but added they were interested in other opportunities.
Databank employs 950 people full- and part-time throughout New Zealand.
EDS, owned by General Motors since 1984, employs about 70,000 people  worldwide and in 1993 posted revenues of 8.6 billion US dollars.
The firm's president and group executive for Asia-Pacific, Edward Yang,  said Databank would provide a base for both the export and import of  information technology.
The four banks which formerly owned Databank have signed agreements  committing themselves to specified levels of business with it for five years,  outgoing board member Harry Price, who is also general manager of Westpac NZ,  said. Their business at the moment accounts for more than 75 percent of  Databank's turnover.
