Britain's governing Conservative Party trails a  distant second in the polls less than three weeks ahead of European elections,  a survey published Monday showed.
According to the survey in Monday's Daily Express, 27 percent of electors   said they would vote Conservative in the June 9 ballot, compared with 46  percent for the main opposition Labour Party and 22 percent for the Liberal  Democrats.
The poll, published on the day the three main parties launch their  European election campaigns, was carried out last week by the ICM polling  institute among a sample of 1,019 people.
If confirmed on voting day, the percentages would mean the Tories losing  13 of their 32 seats in the Strasbourg parliament.
Labour's share would rise from 36 to 61, and the Liberal Democrats would  win their first seats in the Euro-legislature.
But the poll held better news for the Conservatives' general election  prospects.
Thirty-two percent said they would vote Tory in a national poll -- a rise  of six percent over last month -- while 46 percent said they would back Labour  and 19 percent the Liberal Democrats.
The ICM poll also revealed that just 15 percent of electors could name  their Euro-MP.
