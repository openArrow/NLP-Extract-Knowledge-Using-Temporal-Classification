Britain must play its full part in  Europe and adopt free market policies or fall behind the United States, Japan  and China in the 21st century, Prime Minister John Major said Friday.
He told a Conservative Party meeting here the issue of Europe ran deep in  British politics and "raised concerns and fears that are too often played on  too readily."
"For too long Europe has been the poison in the well of British politics,"  said Major, adding that too many people had presented the debate in  fundamentalist terms, "a little Eurosceptic or a little Europhile.
"This approach misses the real debate," he said. "The real debate must be  about how we can make Europe a success, how to make sure it raises enthusiasm,  not resentment, how to make sure it raises the quality of our life and is not  seen as threatening the nature of our life.
"Europe is absolutely fundamental to this country's national interest,"  said Major. "We cannot turn our backs on that. It would be the ultimate  abdication, a supreme folly."
He offered a vision of a wider, more open, "people's Europe," that would  tackle the concerns of ordinary people and did not seek to interfere where it  was not needed.
Major, who had recast his speech to remove political aspects in the wake  of the sudden death Thursday of opposition Labour Party leader John Smith,  renewed his tribute to Smith.
"We can weep for a good man - even an opponent - because we recognise his  qualities," he said.
Despite "artificial confrontations" twice a week in the Commons question  time with the Labour leader, Major said, he liked Smith.
Their often bitter political confrontations, he said, concealed  "friendship, decency, respect and understanding that existed behind the scenes  in politics."
