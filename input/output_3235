Graf, chasing the Grand Slam after her triumphs at last year's Wimbledon  and US Open and this year's Australian Open, dropped only four games and  needed just 57 minutes to sweep aside Slovakia's Katarina Studenikova.
The 24-year-old German, who has previous wins here in 1987, 1988 and 1983,  now plays Stephanie Rottier of the Netherlands. Rottier defeated Natalia  Medvedeva of the Ukraine 6-2, 3-6, 6-3.
The men's event lost tenth-seed Boris Becker before the three-times  Wimbledon champion had hit a ball in anger.
The big German was forced to withdraw after injuring his back in training  and ordered by doctors to rest for at least ten days.
The injury to the 26-year-old, who had been hoping to win the only major  title that has always eluded him, could affect his bid for a fourth title at  Wimbledon next month.
Henri Leconte, finalist in 1988, was another early casualty and the  crowd-pleaser admitted he may be getting too old.
Leconte, now 30, went down in straight-sets to Dutchman Paul Haarhuis.
"It's tough to feel you are slower but that's the way it is. I feel pain  all the time and I have had many operations. It's not going to get any  easier," he said.
"I love playing tennis but I don't know what the future will hold or even  if I shall be able to play here again," he said.
Andrei Medvedev, tipped by many as a possible finalist, had an easy start  against Wally Masur of Australia, but Sweden's Nicklas Kulti, a  quarter-finalist two years ago, should give the Ukrainian more of a test in  the second round.
