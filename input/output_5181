Former communists are assured of an absolute  majority in the Hungarian parliament after four years of conservative rule,  according to exit polls during voting Sunday.
The Szonda-Ipsos institute predicted that the Socialist Party led by  former foreign minister Gyula Horn would win 208 of the 386 seats, and another  pollster, the Median Institute, gave it 196 seats.
