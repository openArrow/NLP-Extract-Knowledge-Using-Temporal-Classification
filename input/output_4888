Indian army troops captured a top Kashmiri  Moslem militant leader Saturday in the state capital of Srinagar, army sources  said.
Maussam Ali, supreme commander of the Al-Barq organisation, offered no  resistance and gave himself up after his hideout in the Rajbagh district was  surrounded by troops, the sources said.
The Al-Barq, or lightning, is one of several Moslem militant groups  campaigning for Kashmir's secession from Hindu-majority India and merger with  its Moslem neighbour Pakistan.
Meanwhile, army and paramilitary troops were continuing a sweep Saturday  in woods surrounding the district of Doda where violence linked to Moslem  militancy has left 15 people dead in the past week.
Kashmir government officials said the operation launched Friday was  ordered to flush out foreign mercenaries believed to be hiding in the area.
Indian authorities allege that Islamic mercenaries and Kashmiri militant  sympathisers, mainly Afghans, are fighting alongside local rebels. Nine  foreigners were killed in a gun battle with troops Friday.
Violence linked to the Moslem rebellion in Kashmir, India's only  Moslem-majority state, has claimed more than 9,000 lives since 1989.
