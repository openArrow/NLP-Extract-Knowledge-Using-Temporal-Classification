A Greenpeace ship delayed the  first British submarine test-firing of at US-made Trident missile Thursday off  the coast of Florida in a protest against nuclear proliferation.
A helicopter from the environmental group's ship Solo and four inflatable  rafts forced the British submarine HMS Vanguard to halt two launches of an  unarmed missile about 80 kilometers (50 miles) east of Cape Canaveral.
But several hours later HMS Vanguard managed to launch a missle.
"The trident is a colossal wast of money, a Cold War relic and we're  trying to wake people up to the fact that things have have changed and the  major arms control worry is proliferation of nuclear weapons," said Greenpeace  coordinator Steve Shallhorn.
The test was part of a 1985 US-British nuclear weapons cooperation  agreement, which Greenpeace charges violates the nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty's ban on transfers of nuclear technology to any party.
"On the one hand the US is threatening to bomb North Korea because that  country is allegedly building nuclear weapons, but on the other hand they're  handing the British a missile and components for a warhead on a platter," said  Shallhorn.
The Vanguard is the first of four Trident-class submarines planned by  Britian and is carrying out its final tests before becoming operational later  this year.
Greenpeace delayed a US Trident test in 1989 but a second attempt that  year was thwarted when Navy vessels repeatedly rammed the ship, according to a  Greenpeace statement.
