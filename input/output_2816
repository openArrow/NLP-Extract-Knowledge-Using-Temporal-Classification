Eubank almost spared the judges the task of adding up their scorecards  when he had Close in desperate trouble in the 10th round with a short right,  followed by a powerful uppercut which had the Irishman going all over the  place.
But Close hung on for dear life, not allowing Eubank the one big shot to  finish the job.
Eubank drained himself of stamina with that assault and had to go once  more to the final bell, this time with blood weeping from a cut on his left  eyebrow.
It was Eubank's 15th WBO title fight and earned him a purse of 861,000  pounds for his night's work. Under the Sky deal, he should be set up for the  rest of his life.
While Eubank gets ready to count the pounds, Close's manager, Barney  Eastwood, was outraged at the scoring.
He described the six-point margin carded by Glen as "ludicrous" and it was  not surprising that he felt the verdict of Francis was spot on.
