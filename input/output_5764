Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata reaffirmed  Tuesday that the government should in no way give Emperor Akihito a political  role when he travels abroad.
Commenting on the cancellation of a visit by Akihito to the memorial of  Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbour during his upcoming US tour, Hata  said the emperor's travel abroad should be strictly for exchanges of "good  will."
"I don't think it is desirable that he will be tied into any political  event."
The December 1941 attack brought the United States into World War II,  killing 2,403 American servicemen and destroying scores of US naval ships and  aircraft, including the USS Arizona.
But a planned visit to the USS Arizona memorial at Pearl Habour, Hawaii,  on the final leg of Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko's June 10-26 tour of  11 US cities, was dropped after reports of it stirred national sentiment here.
The visit provoked fears among conservatives and right-wingers that the  emperor would be forced to apologise for the attack. On the other side of  Japan's political sphere, there has been cautious reaction to any possible  political use of the emperor, whose role has been reduced to a symbolic one  after the war.
Hata, who took over on April 28 from Morihiro Hosokawa who resigned over a  financial scandal, said he did not personally know about the emperor's plan to  visit the Pearl Harbour memorial.
Akihito will instead visit the Punch Bowl national cemetry, for soldiers  killed in the war. "There is nothing in particular to talk about this visit,"  Hata said.
At a meeting with US journalists over tea last week, Akihito reportedly  said under the constitution he is strictly a symbolic monarch. The elected  government would decide his travel schedule, he added, and he would do what  the government told him.
As a crown prince, Akihito visited the USS Arizona memorial in 1960 and  paid tribute to the war dead.
