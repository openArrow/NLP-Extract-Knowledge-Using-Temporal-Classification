Scotland's rugby union coach Douglas Morgan played  down his tour party's injury and unavailability problems as they flew out to  Argentina on Tuesday.
The Scots, who will play two Tests during their six-match visit, have lost  six players with international experience.
But Morgan shrugged it off by saying: "We have not been badly hit up  front. We have most of our Five Nations pack on the tour and, with the likes  of Alan Watt in good form, I expect a battle for several of the front five  poitions."
Morgan admitted the loss of back row forward Rob Wainwright through injury  was a big blow, but added: "We still have big physical forwards like Peter  Walton who should thrive on conditions in Argentina.
"And Dave McIvor, who was a late call-up, could also be just the kind of  back row forward we need."
