Sinn Fein, the political wing of the outlawed IRA,  has made what Irish government sources said Friday was a "genuine attempt" to  break the deadlocked peace process by seeking clarification on certain points  in the landmark Anglo-Irish declaration.
The sources, quoted by the Irish Times of Dublin, said Sinn Fein had sent  a document to the Irish government outlining the points it felt needed further  explanation.
Another source quoted by the Times described the document as "substantial"  and said it would be transmitted immediately to London.
Since the Anglo-Irish document was signed, Sinn Fein, which is led by  Gerry Adams, has asked London for "clarifications" before giving any answer to  conditions set down in the declaration.
But London and Dublin have both criticized Sinn Fein's queries up to now  as being too vague.
The declaration was signed by Britain and Ireland to try to end 25 years  of sectarian bloodshed in Northern Ireland.
It broke ground with an offer from Britian to bring Sinn Fein into  negotiations on Northern Ireland's future provided the Irish Republican Army  fighters observed a total three-month ceasefire.
On Thursday night before he left for a visit to the United States, Irish  Prime Minister Albert Reynolds said he had hoped for a positive development to  end the impasse over the declaration.
