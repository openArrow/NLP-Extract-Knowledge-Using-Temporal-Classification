Japan's Marubeni Corp. has signed cooperation  agreements with Russia's Siberian Far East Oil Corp. (Sidanco) and Anglo-Swiss  Mining Corp. to develop oil reserves in Russia, a spokesman said Tuesday.
The spokesman said the Japanese trading company would also consider taking  up equity in Sidanco, a Moscow-based joint venture between the Russian  government and eight oil companies, mostly based in Tyumen in western Siberia.
"We will examine the possibility of taking a direct stake in Sidanco in  the future," he said.
The agreement with Sidanco covers exploration, the purchase of equipment  and fund raising. The agreement with Anglo Swiss covers the development of oil  fields in both Russian and third countries, as well as possible cooperation in  exporting crude oil and other products to Japan, the spokesman said.
Sidanco, estimated to be Russia's third-largest crude oil producer with a  capacity of 700,000 barrels a day, is reportedly interested in developing oil  fields in China and Vietnam as well as Russia.
