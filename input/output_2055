A plan to restructure the European steel industry  by reducing capacity and shedding 50,000 jobs has collapsed because of  disputes over subsidies for Italian plants.
The plan by the commission of the European Union was well and truly dead  because it had proved impossible to reach a minimum figure for the reduction  of productive capacity, Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said here  Thursday.
It would be impossible to achieve cuts of 19 million tonnes per year in  the capacity to produce rolled steels.
State-owned and private firms had promised to close factories with  capacity amounting to 11 million tonnes, he said.
The plan had been launched by industry ministers from the 12 EU countries  in February 1993 to put the industry, which has been hard hit by a fall of  prices, on a competitive footing. It would also have led to the loss of at  least 50,000 jobs.
Van Miert and Commissioner Martin Bangemann, who is responsible for  industry, were obstructed by the problem of the Bresciani, the small Italian  steel manufacturers in the region of Brescia in northern Italy.
They had agreed to remove capacity to produce five million to six million  tonnes on condition that they could receive aid of 415 million ECUs (477  million dollars) from the Italian state. But all such aid must be approved by  the commission.
Van Miert had asked the rest of the commission to accept what was termed a  "flexible interpretation" of EU regulations concerning state aid so that  capacity could be cut quickly towards the figure of 19 million tonnes.
But a majority of the commission rejected this.
The decision that the plan is now dead throws into question social,  financial and commercial measures which were to have been part of the scheme.  They were intended to protect companies while they restructured.
Funds would have been available for the re-training of workers who lost  their jobs, and imports of steel from central and eastern Europe, and  particularly from the Czech Republic, would have been restricted temporarily.
Van Miert said that these measures were no longer justified.
The commission had also authorised industrialists to establish financial  arrangements to help each other. This was never used.
Ministers from EU countries are to study the situation at a special meeting  in June.
The 12 EU countries approved plans for reductions of capacity by six  subsidised companies, among them Ilva of Italy, SCI of Spain and EKO-Stahl of  Germany, on December 18 1993 after many difficulties.
But private or non-subsidised producers held that the agreement was  unbalanced since it approved public subsidies totalling 6.7 billion ECUs in  respect of cuts in production capacity of 5.5 million tonnes.
These unsubsidised producers have since shown reluctance to close plant,  fearing that in so doing they would hand market share to their competitors.
