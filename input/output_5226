Ireland's storming World Cup warm-up  continued here on Sunday as they added the stunned German World Champions to  their list of famous scalps.
Ireland, who beat Bolivia five days ago, went one better with a 2-0 win  against Berti Vogts's men, with unlikely heroes Gary Kelly, a teenage  substitute, and Tony Cascarino sealing the victory in front of a 50,000 crowd.
But Ireland manager Jack Charlton, a self-confessed German fan who has  backed them to retain the trophy, immediately backed Vogts's men to bounce  back.
Charlton said: "I have seen nothing today to make me change my mind about  the Germans. I tipped them a month ago to win the World Cup.
"Our goalkeeper made some great saves and we got the goals at nice times  but they missed a few chances. It's a bad result for Berti Vogts, the German  manager and a great result for us. It will please the people back home.
"Maybe we did have some luck but everybody knows now we are very difficult  to play against and we certainly did not allow the Germans much room to hurt  us.
"Maybe we will be taken a little more seriously."
