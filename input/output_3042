Cleanup crews worked through the day  Sunday to clean up some 200 barrels of oil spilled by a tanker near the site  of the worst spill in US history.
The Eastern Lion, which was carrying about 830,000 barrels of oil for BP  Exploration, began leaking when it was at the Valdez terminal Saturday,   fouling the waters rich in marine life.
Booms have contained most of the spill and a spokesman for the Alaskan  company said 400 barrels of oily water had been recovered by Sunday and that  the cleanup was continuing.
A citizens advisory group said some seals, otters and birds had been  dirtied by the oil but were not in any immediate danger.
The terminal is 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the site where the Exxon  Valdez ran aground in 1989, dumping 45 million liters (11 million gallons) of  oil into Prince William Sound.
