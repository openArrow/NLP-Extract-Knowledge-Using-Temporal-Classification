A fire which ravaged a Red Sea ferry off the  Egyptian coast left seven people dead and 14 missing, rescue services said  Friday.
Two more bodies were fished out of the sea overnight as the search went on  for survivors from Thursday's fire, which swept through the Qamar al-Saudi as  it carried 589 people from Jeddah in Saudi Arabia to Egypt's port of Suez.
The blaze, triggered by an engine room explosion, burned for 18 hours  before the ship finally sank.
