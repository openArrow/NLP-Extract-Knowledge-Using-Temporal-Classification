Vietnam and the United States have taken their first  step towards resuming relations by agreeing to open liaison offices in their  capitals nearly two decades after the former enemies ended their conflict, a  statement said Thursday.
US Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord and Vice Foreign Minister Le  Mai exchanged letters on May 20 and 21 agreeing to the opening of liaison  offices in Hanoi and Washington, the foreign ministry said.
The two sides have been negotiating to open the offices since February,  when President Bill Clinton lifted a sweeping trade ban imposed on Hanoi in  the 1960s and extended across Vietnam after the communist victory over the  US-backed government in 1975.
"The initial official representation will be in the form of liaison  offices and the head of the office will hold the title 'Chief of Liaison  Office,'" the statement said.
The last US diplomats stationed in Vietnam left in an ignominous departure  by helicopter from the roof of what was then Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City, as  North Vietnamese troops closed in on the city in April 1975.
