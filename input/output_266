The Greek drachma was again under sharp pressure on  Friday six weeks before the European Union's full liberalization of the  capital market, and Greece threw part of its reserves into propping up the  currency.
The drachma had come under speculative attack on Wednesday, which resumed  in full force on Friday after a holiday, forcing the Bank of Greece to step in  to support the currency against the German mark and the dollar, Athens forex  traders said.
Iorgos Kondoyorgis, vice-president of Citibank Greece, said banking  authorities had thrown 500 to 600 million dollars onto the forex market on  Friday, though the country's foreign exchange reserves were only around nine  billion dollars.
At the close, the drachma was maintained at 147.70 to the mark and 247.10  to the dollar, slightly up from Wednesday levels.
"There is no question, it is out of the question and it will never be a  question for the government to devalue - that's clear and the market knows  it", said government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos.
Greek European affairs minister Theodore Pangalos ruled out the idea that  full liberalization of the EU capital market be deferred, as some opposition  members have demanded. "That decision (liberalization) will have no effect on  the drachma. It will lead only to losses for the speculators", he said.
But such statements do not seem to have convinced experts, who think the  current turbulence is very serious. "If speculation continues at this rate,  half of the reserves will melt away in a few days and a monetary adjustment  will become likely", one European expert told AFP. He said the drachma is now  overvalued by 10 to 20 percent.
