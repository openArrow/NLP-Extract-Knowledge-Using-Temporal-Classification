A decision by the British Broadcasting Corporation  to grant gay employees a week's paid holiday for a "honeymoon break" with  their partners provoked howls of protest among Conservative MPs, reports said  Sunday.
The homosexual workers will also have the right to a 75 pound bonus (112,5  dollars), already paid to heterosexual couples.
"In line with our equal opportunities policy, the BBC has decided to  extend the marriage leave provision to include same sex partners, and  heterosexual couples who undergo a formal ceremony of commitment, in addition  to the already existing provision for legally recognised marriages," a BBC  spokesman said.
Some MPs from the ruling Conservative Party called on National Heritage  Secretary Peter Brooke, whose office oversees the BBC, to threaten the  corporation with a cut in the licence fee which finances it, if the public  sector broadcaster did not overturn its decision.
"We seem to have gone raving mad," said Tory rightwinger Geoffrey Dickens.  He called the move "ludicrous and outrageous."
