Throughout the campaign the ruling party sought to discredit Pena Gomez, a  black, by portraying him as the son of Haitians, while raising the specter of  a flood of refugees from the Dominican Republic's crisis-torn neighbor.
The United States said Thursday that it was watching the vote-count  carefully.
"We view with great concern the (National Democratic Institute) findings  of significant irregularities," said State Department spokesman David Johnson,  referring to a federally funded agency to promote democracy.
"We urge all the Dominican parties to seek to address immediately these  findings and other legitimate charges of election irregularities," he added.
Business leaders worried aloud Thursday that an extended dispute could  hurt tourist revenues, which provide 70 percent of the Dominican Republic's  hard currency.
"Tourism is the dorsal spine of our economy, but it is very sensitive to  these types of situations," said Pedro Garrido, director of the National  Association of Hotel and Restaurant Owners.
About 1.4 million Germans, Italians, Spanish, British, US and other  tourists visit the Dominican Republic annually. They spent 1.2 million dollars  in 1993.
