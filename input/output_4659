German Chancellor Helmut Kohl called Friday for  construction of a high-speed rail line linking London to Moscow via Paris,  Frankfurt, Berlin and Warsaw.
"Our goal is to create as quickly as possible a high-speed link across the  continent," he told the lower house of parliament.
"This is also a Russian political goal, clearly expressed by President  Boris Yeltsin during his recent visit" to Germany earlier this month, he said.
German Transport Minister Matthias Wissman has said the rail project was  under study but that substantial financing would have to be found.
London and Paris are now linked by rail through the Channel tunnel, and  there are preliminary plans to extend a high-speed rail line due to be built  between Paris and Strasbourg on to Frankurt.
