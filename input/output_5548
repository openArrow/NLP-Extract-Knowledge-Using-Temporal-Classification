Anyone who reckons football is a young man's game  will find little evidence to back up his argument at this year's World Cup as  a clutch of "golden oldies" return to the sport's biggest stage.
Germany still has nine of the 11 players that won the World Cup in Italy  four years ago, including two who have returned from the international  wilderness.
Manager Berti Vogts says experience is vital, but young legs will also be  invaluable in the steam-heat on the other side of the Atlantic next month.
Vogts has named 34-year-old Rudi Voeller, Juergen Klinsmann, 29, Andreas  Brehme, 30, Guido Buchwald, 33, Lothar Matthaeus, 32, Bodo Illgner, 26,  Juergen Kohler, 28, Thomas Berthold, 29 and Thomas Haessler, 27, in his 20-man  squad.
Brehme returned from 18-months out of international football to play his  part in a friendly victory over Brazil in November, and Voeller was only  recently inked into the line-up after Vogts urged him to come out of  international retirement.
But Vogts has no dicciculty defending his use of the tried and trusted.
"It's tough for newcomers to play well in their first World Cup," he says.
"And players are getting fitter and fitter with better diet and training  methods.
"I think the World Cup in the future will see more players in their 30s  and early 40s."
Brazil also boasts its share of ageing stars.
The two Ricardos in defence are 30 and 31, striker Bebeto is 30,  midfielder Dunga, 30 while defenders Branco, Jorginho, Carlos Cesar and keeper  Zetti are all  29.
Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira explains: "I just pick the best players  whatever their age.
"As long as they can perform to the high standard I expect, I don't care  if they're 45."
At 33, Argentina's incomparable Diego Maradona is set to play in his  fourth World Cup even though he clearly lacks the explosive pace that once  bewildered defenders.
