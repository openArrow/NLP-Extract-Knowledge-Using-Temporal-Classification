Israel stepped up security on Sunday fearing  possible attacks as the interrogation of kidnapped Moslem Shiite leader  Mustafa Dirani continued, military officials and state radio reported.
The questioning of the 46-year-old, head of the pro-Iranian "Resistance of  the Faithful" who was snatched in a daring airborne raid in Lebanon on  Saturday, was taking place at an undisclosed location, the officials said.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin announced Saturday that "the aim was solely  to obtain information on the fate of the aviator who was captured by Dirani's  men."
Navigator Ron Arad was caught after being shot down on a bombing raid on a  Palestinian refugee camp east of Sidon in 1986. He is the only one of six  Israeli hostages believed still to be alive, proably in Iranian hands.
Military intelligence chief General Uri Saguy said Saturday that Dirani  had "already provided some answers to questions we asked for a long time". But  he did not elaborate.
Israel embassies and foreign representations were told to tighten security  fearing reprisals from pro-Iranian groups led by Hezbollah, which which Dirani  has close links, Israeli radio announced.
Military officials said the army was "ready" for possible attacks after  Hezbollah threatened to step up the fight against Israel's occupation of a  "security zone" in southern Lebanon.
"Experience shows that after Israeli operations in Lebanon there is often  a riposte," one official said.
