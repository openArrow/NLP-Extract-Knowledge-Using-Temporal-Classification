An improved version of the US Sikorsky CH-53  helicopter safely took Israeli commandos deep into and out of Syrian-held  eastern Lebanon to kidnap a Shiite Moslem leader, a newspaper revealed Sunday.
Israeli Aeronautics Industries modified the CH-53 turning it into a  ultra-sophisticated war machine, which took Mustafa Dirani and his men totally  by suprise on Saturday, the daily Maariv reported.
The new version of the heavy transporter, baptised Yassur 2000, stunned  the president of Sikorsky when he visited Israel two months ago.
Maariv said the Yassur's range had been considerably extended and with two  engines, described as relatively silent, could fly up to 6,500 metres (21,000  feet).
Latest avionics give the pilot total night-sight through an electronic  helmet.
Two Yassur helicopters, with unspecified aerial support, penetrated a  mountainous area of Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley in the pre-dawn raid  undetected by Syrian radar.
They discharged vehicles which commandos used to drive up to Dirani's  house in Qsarnabaa village and brought the whole team back to Israel. One  commando was lightly wounded in the thigh.
