South Africa's new President Nelson Mandela  has strongly denied a London press report that he plans to retire in two  years' time.
In a weekend statement released by his African National Congress, Mandela,  who was sworn in as the country's first black head of state on May 10, said  the report in the Sunday Times was "rumour-mongering written with the  intention to create uncertainty."
"The poeple of South Africa have given the president a mandate and he  intends to fulfil that mandate," said Mandela, 75, terming the article  "totally unfounded and malicious disinformation."
The newspaper quoted ANC sources as saying Mandela has "privately hinted  he will step down once a final constitution has been written and he has  overseen the country's first steps toward reconciliation."
Manela's "determination to give up power well ahead of the next general  election has sparked a power struggle" within the ANC, it said.
The parliament that emerged from the country's first democratic election  on April 26-29 is mandated to rewrite the nation's final constitution over the  next five years.
South Africa is in the meantime run by an interim constitution that went  into effect at midnight on April 26, the start of the second day of the  historic poll.
