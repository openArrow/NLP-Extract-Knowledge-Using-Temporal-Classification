The bloodied, beaten corpses of two  Palestinians kidnapped from their Gaza homes by a radical Islamic group were  found hanged Friday on electricity pylons here, Palestinian sources said.
Hussein Duhsen, 31, and Abdel Wahab Raadi, 35, were kidnapped Wednesday by  masked men in an attack claimed by HAMAS who accused them of being Israeli  collaborators.
It is the first execution of "collaborators" since the redeployment of the  Israeli army two weeks ago to set up the newly-autonomous areas of the Gaza  Strip and Jericho under the May 4 Israel-PLO autonomy accord.
HAMAS and the PLO declared a month-long truce on the killings of  collaborators to allow them to make amends. The truce ended a week ago.
Palestinian police told AFP they viewed the double murder "very seriously"  and an inquiry had been opened.
