An official Japanese task force studying measures to  give greater market access to foreign products and services has listed 21  areas for deregulation, officials said Friday.
The proposals were made by the Office of Trade and Industry Ombudsman  (OTO) in a report submitted Friday to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata.
The report proposed that Japanese regulations and testing procedures on  imports of foods and industrial products, including construction materials,  should be relaxed.
Japan is to announce market-opening measures before the end of June under  pressure from foreign countries, particularly the United Statets which suffers  chronic huge trade deficits with Japan.
Hata was quoted as saying at a meeting of economic ministers Friday that  each ministry and government agency should make efforts for economic  deregulation.
Those attending the meeting included Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa.
