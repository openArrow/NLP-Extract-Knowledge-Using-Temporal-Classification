A 30-year-old man will appear in court Friday  charged with directing terrorism and membership of the outlawed loyalist  Ulster Freedom Fighters, police said.
The charges against the man from the Shankill Road area of west Belfast  follow widespread arrests across protestant loyalist areas of north and west  of the city by police and troops on Monday.
A 26-year-old woman is also expected to appear before Belfast magistrates  charged with making property available to terrorists, providing a false alibi  and aiding and abetting the gathering of information likely to be of use to  terrorists.
A number of other people arrested in the Monday swoops are still being  questioned by police.
