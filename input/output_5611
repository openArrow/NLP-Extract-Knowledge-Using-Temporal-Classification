An angry Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the  Cambodian co-premier, returned here Tuesday from peace talks with the Khmer  Rouge in North Korea and blasted the rebel faction for sinking the peace  process.
"In Pyongyang the Khmer Rouge has clearly shown that they want ... to  resolve the remaining problems through war," Prince Ranariddh told reporters  at Phnom Penh airport after his arrival from the North Korean capital.
He said Khmer Rouge nominal leader Khieu Samphan had refused proposals by  King Norodom Sihanouk for a nationwide ceasefire which would have begun June  15 and which the government had already agreed to.
The prince said King Sihanouk had pleaded with the rebel leader to agree  to the ceasefire, but Khieu Samphan had kept up a "very tough and unreasonable  stance."
Prince Ranariddh said the failure to agree on a ceasefire during the talks   meant Cambodia had lost its chance to end its long-running civil war by  peaceful means.
The two sides released a joint declaration Saturday at the close of the  talks, saying they had pledged to work for national reconciliation and a  ceasefire and to keep Cambodia's territory intact.
The peace talks, which began Friday and ended on Saturday, two days  earlier than scheduled, brought together King Sihanouk, co-premiers Prince  Ranariddh and Hun Sen, parliament chairman Chea Sim and Khieu Samphan.
