British Gas said on Wednesday it would sell its 53  percent stake in the international company Bow Valley Energy (BVE) for about  720 million Canadian dollars (524 US dollars) to the Canadian company Talisman  Energy.
BVE, which has its headquarters in Calgary, is a natural-resource company  involved in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, primarily  in Britain, Indonesia, Canada and the Netherlands.
British Gas said the sale price, payable in cash and Talisman shares, was  based on an average price of 15.45 Canadian dollars per BVE share.
Talisman, which plans to extend the offer to all BVE shareholders, will  also pay 50 million Canadian dollars for British Gas' holding of  non-convertible preference shares.
The deal is subject to shareholder approval.
British Gas chief executive Cedric Brown said the sale was "consistent  with our policy of focusing on international markets where we see the greatest  growth potential, and where we can apply our expertise."
British Gas has already reduced its Canadian activities, selling in  November 1993 its 85 percent stake in Consumer Gas Ltd alongwith other  distribution agreements to the Canadian group Interprovincial Pipe Line for  around 1.2 billion Canadian dollars.
In 1993, BVE reported net profits of about 7.4 million Canadian dollars on  turnover of 242.9 million Canadian dollars.
While Talisman, which is particularly active in western Canada, last year  announced net profits of 25.8 million dollars on turnover of 189.4 million  Canadian dollars.
