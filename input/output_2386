The head of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing,  Friday welcomed London's reply to the organisation's queries on the  Anglo-Irish peace declaration as a "positive signal" but said it would not  bring a quick stop to IRA's anti-British campaign.
"It would be very begrudging indeed not to recognize the fact that each of  our 20 questions have been addressed by the government and that in itself is a  positive signal," Mitchel McLaughlin said in a radio interview.
"In the context of the painstaking effort of building a peace process in  Ireland, this movement has to be welcomed as an indication of serious intent."
McLaughlin said that Sinn Fein's answer to London's overture would not  come before the June 9 European elections but added that "the conditions that  will render the IRA campaign redundant are still a long way off."
London, answering questions put by Sinn Fein last week, offered Thursday  to give Northern Ireland a referendum if the question of a united Ireland  arose as part of a peace process.
The pledge came in a detailed reply to Sinn Fein, which demanded  clarification of last December's Anglo-Irish declaration for peace in Northern  Ireland.
The queries were forwarded by the Irish government last Friday on behalf  of Sinn Fein which had so far avoided responding to the December 15  declaration offering it a part in the political peace process, if the IRA  renounced violence.
Britain's Under Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Michael Ancram  warned Friday that the peace process would continue without Sinn Fein if the  organization continued to "play for time."
Ancram, speaking in an interview on BBC-radio, said that following  London's reply Thursday, the IRA had only one question to answer: "When is the  violence, when is the killing, when is the terror going to stop?"
