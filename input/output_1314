The dollar weakened slightly against other major  currencies here early Tuesday as traders braced for a short-term interest rate  hike expected from the Federal Reserve's policy-setting committee.
Most traders predicted between a quarter to a half percentage point  increase in the federal funds rate -- the overnight interbank loan rate -- and  a half point rise in the discount rate, said a trader with a major European  bank in New York.
Gold, meanwhile, edged up to 383.25 dollars an ounce, up 25 cents from  late Monday.
At about 9:30 a.m. (1330 GMT), the dollar traded at 1.6700 German marks,  down from 1.6710 several hours earlier in London and from 1.6735 late Monday  in New York.
Against the yen, it was quoted at 104.45, down from 104.87 in London and  104.75 in New York.
The greenback also lost several fractions against other major European  currencies, slipping to 5.7260 French francs from 5.7370 late Monday, to  1.4235 Swiss francs (1.4265) and to 0.6651 pound sterling (0.6653).
"We can only wait for the Fed to move," said the trader, who predicted the  dollar would fluctuate within very tight margins until midday.
The Fed's Open-Market Committee, which sets US monetary policy for weeks  to come, began a closed-door meeting in Washington at 9:00 a.m. (1300 GMT).
