Poland Tuesday announced the introduction of a new  Zloty as of January 1, to be worth 10,000 old Zlotys.
A government bill to that effect will shortly be put to parliament, an  official statement said.
Plans to introduce the new Zloty have been delayed several times because  of high inflation, which dropped from 44 percent in 1992, to 35 percent in  1993 and is expected to decrease to 27 percent this year.
The introduction of the new currency will be made over a period of two  years during which the old currency will also remain in circulation.
The dollar is currently worth 22,500 zlotys.
