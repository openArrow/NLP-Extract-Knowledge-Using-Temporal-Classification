An OPEC-style Arab oil group has decided to  return to its Kuwait headquarters in July after an absence of four years  because of the Iraqi invasion, Gulf officials said Friday.
They said senior OAPEC delegates would meet in Cairo, site of its  temporary office, in early June to approve the decision following the  completion of arrangements to move back.
The Organisation of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries and other Arab  institutions were forced out of Kuwait when Iraqi forces stormed the emirate  in August 1990.
OAPEC oil ministers decided to shift back last year but the move was  delayed due to Kuwait's refusal to grant visas to Iraqi staff. The Gulf  officials declined to say how the problem had been tackled.
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Libya set up the organisation in Beirut in 1968.  Two years later, it was joined by Qatar, Bahrain, Algeria and the United Arab  Emirates (UAE), and in 1972 by Iraq, Egypt and Syria.
Tunisia, a small oil-producer, also became a member but dropped out five  years ago because of financial problems.
OAPEC produced an average 16.87 million barrels of oil per day in 1993,  nearly a quarter of total world crude supplies.
Its crude reserves stood at 621 billion barrels, more than 60 percent of  the world's reserves, while its gas reserves accounted for 21 percent of the  world's.
The organisation is the only forum for Arab energy cooperation, which  covers joint ventures and exchange of expertise.
Saudi Arabia, the world's leading oil-producer, and six other OAPEC states  are also members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
