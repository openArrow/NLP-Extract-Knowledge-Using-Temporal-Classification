Six people were killed and six injured on  Saturday when armed motorists opened fire on some communal taxis, South  African police said.
Police spokesman Captain Wikus Weber said the attack was almost certainly  connected with an ongoing "taxi war."
Several people have been killed in recent years in the fight between rival  companies over the lucrative business of providing transport between their  jobs in the cities and their homes in the townships.
