The UN Security Council approved the phased  deployment of 5,500 peacekeepers to Rwanda and slapped an arms embargo on the  violence-torn African nation.
The vote came early Tuesday after near-record nine hours of debates and  consultations among the 15-member council.
Rwanda voted against the clause calling for an arms-embargo, but it did  not prevent the resolution from being adopted.
In response to a US proposal, the UN peacekeepers will be deployed in  different phases which will be submitted to ongoing reviews.
Washington's insistence that the peacekeepers be sent in stages had  delayed the vote on the resolution since it was first circulated Friday and  drew harsh criticism from several countries.
Resolution 918 calls on UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to  immediately send to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR)  several dozen UN military observers who had been evacuated to Nairobi last  month after the fighting broke out.
The size of the peacekeeping mission to Rwanda was drastically reduced  from 2,700 to some 300 after UN troops were killed in the fighting which broke  out five weeks ago.
The resolution expands UNAMIR to a maximum 5,500 peacekeepers "to  contribute to the security and protection of displace persons, refugees and  civilians at risk," and "to provide security and support for the distribution  of relief supplies and humanitarian relief operations."
The council also called on all states to "prevent the sale or supply to  Rwanda...of arms and related material of all types."
At Washington's request, the UN chief was asked to report "as soon as  possible on the next phase of UNAMIR's mission including inter-alia on the  cooperation of the parties, progress towards a cease-fire, availability of  resources and the proposed duration of the mandate for further review by the  Council..."
