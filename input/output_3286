Pete Sampras and Steffi Graf took a first step  towards their respective 'Grand Slams' on Monday when they came safely through  the first-round of the French Open Tennis Championships.
But two of the players expected to provide a late challenge disappeared  from the draw.
Sampras dropped only eleven games defeating Spanish qualifier Alberto  Costa and Graf needed just 57 minutes to overcome Slovakia's Katarina  Studenikova.
But 37-year-old fourth seed Martina Navratilova, making her last singles  appearance at the famous Roland Garros Stadium was bundled out of the event by  Miriam Oremans of the Netherlands on the number-one show court and was so  frustrated she smashed her racket in anger for the first time in her 21-year  career.
Meanwhile tenth-seeded Boris Becker, encouraged by his recent run at the  Italian Open where he reached the final and scheduled for a fourth-round  showdown with Sampras, parted company with the tournament without hitting a  ball in anger.
The 26-year-old three-times Wimbledon champion injured his back in a late  training session and was ordered to rest for at least ten days.
Twice-finalist Andre Agassi, whose confidence had been at a low ebb  following early elimination from both the Monte Carlo and Italian Opens,  slapped back the comback challenge of three-times champion Mats Wilander 6-2,  7-5, 6-1 and now faces a major challenge in the shape of eleventh-seeded  slow-court specialist Austrian Thomas Muster.
Muster impressively outslogged experienced Russian Andrei Cherkasov 6-0,  7-5, 6-1
