A powerful explosion badly damaged a  Christian school in the southern Lebanese port city of Sidon early Friday,  without causing any casualties, officials said.
Police said the blast was caused by a bomb, but a government prosecutor  who visited the scene, Khaled Hammud, said no trace of explosives had been  found and it was probably caused by a gas leak.
The investigation was continuing, he said.
The explosion wrecked the dining room and blew out windows at the  evangelical protestant school, formerly known as the American School.
It happened at 5 a.m. (0200 GMT) and was heard over a wide distance.
Headmaster Jamil Yazigi ordered the school's temporary closure and police  sealed off the area.
Yazigi said there had been no warning and he was unaware of why the  school, which has 3,300 pupils, would be the target of a bomb attack.
A blast in a Christian church north of Beirut on February 27 killed 10  people and left 54 hurt.
Sidon, hometown of Prime Minister Rafic Hariri, is mainly Sunni and Shiite  Moslem, but has a small Christian community.
