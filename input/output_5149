Iran has decided to buy four ships from Croatia for  120 million dollars to boost its merchant navy, the Iranian ambassador to  Zagreb said Sunday.
Mohammad Javad Asayech, quoted in Tehran newspapers, said the cost would  be paid in oil.
Iran plans to buy 40 ships by the year 2000 as the merchant fleet is going  through a crisis after lack of development during the 1980-1988 war against  Iraq, according to Mahmud Tarjoman, head of the merchant navy department.
