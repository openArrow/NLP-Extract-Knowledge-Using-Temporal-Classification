Restrictions on the activities of foreign banks  operating in Russia should be lifted by Wednesay next week, the head of  Russia's Central Bank, Viktor Guerashchenko, said Tuesday.
"Pressure has come from several countries and also from Russian commercial  banks which, in their attempt to open subsidiaries overseas, felt like they  were running up against a wall," Guerashchenko said.
The restrictions, enforced last November in a decree signed by President  Boris Yeltsin, were aimed at protecting the country's domestic banking  industry from large Western competitors. They were to remain in effect until  January 1996.
Under the measures, foreign banks operating in Russia could only cater to  foreigners. But those that began working with Russian clients prior to the  restrictions were unaffected.
That meant that of the 12 foreign banks awarded licenses to operate in  Russia, only three were not hit by the restrictions.
The decree sparked strong criticism from western countries which lodged  protests and stressed the important role of foreign banks in Russia.
Several also implicitly threatened retaliation by hinting that Russian  products seeking to enter the European market would be affected.
Experts also predicted when Yeltsin signed the decree that the measure  would harm the country's already struggling economy.
