Northern and southern Yemeni army units fought  on all fronts Saturday as President Ali Abdallah Saleh called off a ceasefire  after the south declared an independent state.
Both sides accused each other of initiating the latest clashes, after  Sanaa had said a ceasefire would come into effect at midnight Friday for a  three-day period to cover the Moslem feast of Al-Adha.
The president's troops mounted "relentless attacks," forcing the south to  retaliate, Aden Radio said in this southern port city which serves as the  power base of Vice President Ali Salem al-Baid, Saleh's bitter rival.
It said the civil war, which erupted on May 5, was raging on all fronts on  Saturday, the eve of the fourth anniversary of the country's unification.
Saleh said earlier in the capital that the ceasefire was off and vowed to  capture Aden after Baid declared an independent Yemeni Democratic Republic in  the south.
He told a press conference at the presidential palace that the declaration  was "unlawful" and that southern forces had ignored the three-day truce.
"We already said we were adhering to the ceasefire but the separatist  forces initiated fighting on all war fronts this morning, so fighting is going  on," he said. "There is no ceasefire."
Saleh warned that his forces were "putting a military ring around Aden"  and added: "Our intention was not to enter the city. However, after the  announcement of separation ... we are obliged to enter the city at all costs.
"Then the armed forces will continue to pursue the separatists in  Mukallah," a port east of Aden where Baid took refuge earlier this week, said  the president.
The northerners had said they would only blockade the city and not enter  it, promising not to harm the civilian population of more than 500,000.
