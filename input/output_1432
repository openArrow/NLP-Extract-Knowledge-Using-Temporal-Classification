The government extended a state of emergency in the  capital for 60 days Tuesday as intelligence officials predicted a new wave of  attacks for the 14th anniversary of the founding of the Shining Path guerrilla  organization.
Authorities said they believed a hard-line faction of the Shining Path was  seeking to destabilize Lima and had launched an "armed strike" in an effort to  shut down several cities in the central Andes region of Peru.
Police and troops tightened security and increased checkpoints in several  strategic locations in Lima.
Intelligence officials said they believed a hard-line faction of the  guerrillas led by Oscar Alberto Ramirez Durand, nicknamed "comrade Feliciano,"  planned a series of attacks to mark the 14th anniversary of the funding of the  Shining Path May 17.
The guerrilla action has led to an estimated 30,000 deaths and cost the  economy some 25 billion dollars. The founder of the Shining Path, Abimael  Guzman, is serving a life sentence in prison.
