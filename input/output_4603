The teams were understood to have forced Mosley to defer changes due for  the Canadian Grand Prix on June 12 to the French race on July 3.
And two engineers and three drivers were to join the FIA technical  committee which could overturn any changes they believed made no real safety  improvement.
The committee was due to meet as early as next Monday in London.
Teams will also join the newly-formed Grand Prix Drivers Association in  examining track safety aspects.
The changes which were to have been introduced in Canada were:
Strengthened lower front wishbone in suspension
Longer cockpits to avoid drivers' heads hitting front
Lateral protection for drivers' heads by raising cockpit sides
Elimination of engine airbox
Ban on special fuel. Must use normal petrol
Increase minimum weight by 25kg
The changes for the German Grand Prix on July 31 are:
Reduced aerodynamic performance by stepping bottom of car
The changes for 1995 are:
50 per cent reduction in downforce
Engine power reduced from 800bhp to 600bhp
