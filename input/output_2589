Facing a first-round clash against returning former champion Mats  Wilander, Agassi, 24, will be hoping to go one step further than his last two  visits to Partis in 1991 and 1992 when he was runner-up. Always a crowd  pleaser with his spectacular brand of tennis, clowning and bizarre clothing,  Agassi has had an up-and-down comeback so far this year after undergoing a  wrist operation. He won his first tournament at Scottsdale and reached the  final at Key Biscayne -- but has since had severe setbacks wirth early losses  at Monte Carlo and Rome.
Strengths: Powerful passing shots and acceleration in strokeplay
Weaknesses: Current lack of confidence and concentration.
IVAN LENDL (USA)
Still going strong at 34, Lendl will be making his 15th apearance at the  Championships he won in 1984, 1986 and 1987. Started the year by reaching the  fourth round at the Australian Open and the final at Sydney, and has also  earned a semi-final berth in Hong Kong and reached four quarter-finals -- at  Dubai, Tokyo, Madrid and Coral Springs.
Strengths: Experience and power
Weaknesses: Age and deteriorating stamina
YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV (Russia)
One of the most exciting newcomers to emerge this season, Kafelnikov, who  was 20 in February and a former doubles and training partner of Medvedev, has  been charging up the rankings with some remarkable results. He won Adaleide,  and Copenhagen, was a finalist in Hamburg and a semi-finalist at Monte Carlo.  And although two of his major defeats were inflicted by Medvedev, he managed  to take some impressive scalps -- including those of Andre Agassi, Michael  Stich (twice), and Goran Ivanisevic.
Strengths: Excellent serve and big forehand
Weaknesses: Impatience and lack of experience
