Battling Arantxa Sanchez got up from a spectacular  fall at the Roland Garros Stadium here on Sunday and moved closer to  recapturing the French Open title she first won as a 17-year-old in 1989.
"I was really worried when I rolled over and my arm was pinned behind  me," said the 22-year-old Spaniard, adding: "But when I was able to pick up my  racket I knew everything would be all right."
The centre-court spill came in the seventh game of the second-set as  Sanchez overwhelmed Germany's Anke Huber 6-3, 6-2.
With nine of the 16 seeds already blown away and the women's draw filled  with unfamiliar newcomers, Sanchez, the number-two, was clearly in no mood to  become the latest big name to join the also-rans.
From the start she went about her business with ferocious efficiency and  never allowed the 24-year-old German time to settle.
Sanchez, who is one of only two players to beat world number-one Steffi  Graf in the last twelve months, was clearly delighted with her game on her  favourite surface.
But the bustling Barcelona player, who has yet to drop a set and who has  conceded only 17 games since launching her eighth campaign for the supreme  clay court title last Monday, is counting no chickens.
"I take it one match at a time," she said. "Anything can happen. But I am  pleased with the way I am playing and I am confident."
Sanchez, who has had three tournament wins in 1994 and who was runner-up  to Graf at the Australian Open and at Delray Beach, now faces Julie Halard.
The 23-year-old French girl, who has risen to 24th in the world rankings  after an excellent season, scored a superb 7-6 (7/2), 7-5 win over  seventh-seed Natalia Zvereva.
