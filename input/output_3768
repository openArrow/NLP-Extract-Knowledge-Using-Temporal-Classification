Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. will boost the monthly  output of its newly launched recreational vehicle RAV4 to 6,500-to-6,600 units  next month, up sharply from an initial 4,500 units a month, due to strong  sales, a spokeswoman said Wednesday.
Toyota has received orders for 9,000 units since it launched the model  earlier this month, the spokeswoman said, adding that monthly sales are  expected to reach 10,000 units by the end of May.
The company had earlier projected monthly domestic sales of 2,000 units of  the 2,000cc vehicle, with a price tag of 1.5 million yen (14,300 dollars) to  1.8 million yen, the spokeswoman said.
