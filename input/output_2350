The Crimean parliament voted Friday to  give the autonomous republic effective independence from Ukraine.
The legislature voted to re-establish a 1992 constitution which provided  for treaty relations between Crimea and Ukraine.
Crimea is now an autonomous republic within Ukraine.
The constitution was never applied since the Crimean parliament amended it  under pressure from Ukrainian authorities.
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said Thursday that Kiev had "enough  force" to force Crimea to respect the Ukrainian constitution.
