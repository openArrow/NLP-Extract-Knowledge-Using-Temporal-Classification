Accidents involving ferries, the most popular mode  of transportation in Bangladesh, have killed 4,000 people in 22 years, the  Financial Express newspaper reported Saturday.
Citing an official investigation report, the daily said that of the 300  accidents on the nation's 230 rivers where deaths resulted, the ferries were   overloaded or guided by unskilled operators.
The accident rate increases during the monsoon season and during  festivals, the report said.
Authorities also charged that some operators pack travellers into a  minimal number of ferries in order to make more money.
The state-owned Inland Water Transport Authority said some 60 million  people travel by ferries annually, and about five million tons of cargo are  shipped by ferry every year.
