South Korea's Daewoo Electronics Co. will open a  design research center in Paris in June as part of the company's marketing  strategy,  Daewoo officials said Thursday.
The institute will study and analyze market trends, including European  consumers' favorite styles and colors, to produce attractively designed  electronics for the region.
Daewoo plans to recruit local designers and experts for the design center  and exchange information with French design institutes in Paris to develop and  produce suitable designs for Europeans, a spokesman said.
The Paris design center, to serve as a pivot for the European market, will  be the second abroad for Daewoo, which set up its first in Tokyo in 1989, the  spokesman said.
