Former Chelsea captain Paul Elliott launched a High  Court battle here on Monday against Dean Saunders, arguing his England hopes  were wrecked by a rash tackle.
Elliott, 30, is suing the Welsh international Dean Saunders over an  incident at Anfield in September 1992.
The defender claims Saunders, 29, then of Liverpool before he moved to  Aston Villa, ruptured his right knee ligaments in the tackle.
Elliott said he felt "excruciating pain", adding: "I was leaping solely at  the ball. I believed I would win it. I was focused. My eyes were solely on the  ball but I was aware of the player running towards me."
He said Saunders "was just jumping on my knee".
Elliott denied he came "flying in" with his foot 18 inches off the ground  and subjected Saunders to "at best an intimidatory tackle or challenge".
Saunders and Liverpool deny liability. They claim the injury was caused by  Elliott's own negligence.
The hearing was adjourned until Tuesday when evidence is expected from Don  Howe, John Hollins and Terry Butcher.
