President Boris Yeltsin on Wednesday approved an  anti-crime plan targetting organized gangs, white-collar crime and corruption,  news agencies reported.
The two-year initiative was prepared by the Russian Security Council with  help from ministries involved in law enforcement, they said.
The blueprint includes measures for better training of police and security  forces and for stronger efforts to fight corruption in the military.
Crime rates have risen dramatically in Russia since the collapse of the  Soviet Union in 1991.
