<EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">Starring</EVENT> Albert Finney and Greta Scacchi, "The Browning Version" <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">provoked</EVENT>  immediate comparisons with such sure-fire English hits as Merchant-Ivory's  "Remains of the Day" or Robin Williams' "Dead Poet's Society."&#13;
For some the comparisons were too much. "Well <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">made</EVENT>, but unoriginal" was a  comment <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">made</EVENT> by more than one critic <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">emerging</EVENT> from a press preview screening  of the film.&#13;
But director Mike Figgis was quick to <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">defend</EVENT> his work, his first time in  the main competition here.&#13;
"I was <EVENT eid="e9" class="I_STATE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">aware</EVENT> of how easy it was to <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">fall</EVENT> into the trap ... of just  <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">presenting</EVENT> a safe picture ... which has <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">become</EVENT> such an accepted cliche of  British filmmaking," he <EVENT eid="e13" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT> in an <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">interview</EVENT> with AFP.&#13;
But he <EVENT eid="e15" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT>: "To me that was far more of a challenge, when you are up  against Merchant-Ivory and a certain perceived world image of England .<EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">.</EVENT> to  <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">take</EVENT> a cliche .... and <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">turn</EVENT> it on its head."&#13;
Finney plays Andrew Crocker-Harris, a classic master being <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">forced</EVENT> to  <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">resign</EVENT> from the school after <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION">18 years</TIMEX3> -- ostensibly due to ill-health,  actually because of unpopularity.&#13;
His wife Laura (Scacchi) is having an affair with the school's American  science teacher -- <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">provoking</EVENT> Finney's emotional crisis which is at the heart  of the film.&#13;
At least one critic at the preview ahead of <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="TIME">Monday night</TIMEX3>'s premiere was  <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">impressed</EVENT> with the film, and in particular with Finney's performance.  "Outstanding," <EVENT eid="e23" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT> one. "I had tears in my eyes."&#13;
Figgis is quite open about his aspirations for the film in commercial and  popular terms.&#13;
"You can either <EVENT eid="e24" class="ASPECTUAL" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="can">choose</EVENT> from a career point of view to be <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">recognized</EVENT> for  intellectual nuance and thereby almost deliberately <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">restrict</EVENT> the output of  your product to the circle that will <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="FUTURE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">read</EVENT> it.&#13;
"Or you can <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="can">use</EVENT> it as a strength," he <EVENT eid="e29" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT>, <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">referring</EVENT> to the film's  familiar themes and setting.&#13;
Figgis, who first <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">came</EVENT> to Cannes in <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE">1988</TIMEX3> with "Stormy <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE">Monday</TIMEX3>", is <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">bidding</EVENT>  to <EVENT eid="e33" class="ASPECTUAL" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">keep</EVENT> up the British success <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">achieved</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE">last year</TIMEX3> by compatriots Mike Leigh  and Ken Loach, who both <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">took</EVENT> prizes on the Croisette.&#13;
The <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DURATION">46-year-old</TIMEX3> director had nothing but praise for his fellow British  filmmakers.&#13;
"Mike Leigh is fantastic, Ken Loach is fantastic," he <EVENT eid="e36" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT>, <EVENT eid="e37" class="REPORTING" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">adding</EVENT>: "I  think there is a feeling <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE">now</TIMEX3> with certain British filmmakers that we can be  braver <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE">now</TIMEX3> with our cliches. That's no bad thing."&#13;
