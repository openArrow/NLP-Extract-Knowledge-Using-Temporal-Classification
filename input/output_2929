An Iranian delegation is to visit Iraq on June 11  to discuss the fate of POWs from the 1980-1988 war, Iranian Foreign Minister  Ali Akbar Velayati said.
Velayati, quoted on Sunday by Etellaat newspaper, said the visit was  initially scheduled to take place next week, but that it had been postponed at  the request of Baghdad.
The minister did not say whether or not he would be heading the delegation.
Tehran radio said on May 4 that Velayati was preparing a trip to Iraq to  discuss bilateral ties and the fate of thousands of prisoners of war from both  countries.
If the visit takes place, it would be the first by Velayati to Iraq since  the 1991 Gulf War, when US-led forces drove Iraqi troops from Kuwait.
The POW issue is the main obstacle to improved relations between the two  neighbors.
Tehran says Iraq is still holding 8,000 of its citizens, military and  civilian, including soldiers captured almost 20 years ago in border skirmishes.
But Iraq has denied holding any and claims 20,000 of its own troops are  being held in Iran.
Iran said last week that Iraq had freed three Iranian prisoners, the first  such release in two years.
Iran has unilaterally released hundreds of Iraqi POWs during the past two  years.
