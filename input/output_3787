Taiwan on Wednesday lifted a ban on package tours  to China that it imposed after 24 Taiwanese tourists were killed in a  mysterious incident on a Chinese lake on March 31.
The decision came after a meeting Tuesday between officials from the  cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), travel agents, the Tourism  Bureau and the transport ministry.
Taiwan imposed the ban in retaliation for what it said was an attempted  cover-up by China of the incident on Qiandao Lake, eastern China, on March 31.
But some regional exclusions will remain in force, including Qiandao Lake  and Tibet,  Hsu Chin-jui, chairman of the Taipei Association of Travel Agents,  said, adding that the association would send representatives to China to talk  with Chinese officials there on travel safety.
Beijing originally insisted the 24 had died in an accident, caused by fire  that broke out aboard their steamer.
But after Taiwan suspended cultural and education exchanges with China and  decided to review its economic policies, Chinese officials announced that it  was a case of robbery with murder and arson and arrested four men.
Taiwanese travel agencies complained that they had lost more than 26.4  million US dollars after cancelling organized tours to the mainland at the  government's behest.
