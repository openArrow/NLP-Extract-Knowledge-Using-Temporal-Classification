From a Denis Wise free-kick after 33-minutes, the ball fell at an awkward  height for Chelsea's John Spencer on the edge of the box. He shot lamely, but  the ball came out nicely for Kjeldbjerg, who fired straight at Schmeichel.
The crowded midfield and slippery pitch stifled flowing play during the  opening exchanges. Norwegian Erland Johnsen was booked in the first minute for  a foul on Giggs as the Londoners gave a first showing of their rugged tactics.
Manchester United skipper Steve Bruce also went into the book in the 18th  as the double-chasers became more and more frustrated. Though United began the  match as overwhelming favourites, it was Chelsea who gained the upper hand  midway through the half.
Mark Stein had a good chance in the 22nd minute at the near post. And  three minutes later, his Chelsea striker partner John Spencer just failed to  make contact in front of Schmeichel's goal.
Moments afterwards, Gavin Peacock confirmed the Londoners superiority as  he hit the crossbar with Schmeichel well beaten. It was Peacock who scored  both goals as Chelsea did a league double over champions United this season.
In the 37th minute, France's Eric Cantona headed across Chelsea's goal,  but Mark Hughes just failed to connect with a header as he sprinted forward.
Four minutes after the interval, Giggs gave Chelsea a taster of further  attacking moves to come with a blistering shot. From then on, it was virtually  all United.
Manchester became the fourth team this century to win the double after  Spurs in 1961, Arsenal in 1971, and Liverpool's 1986 team.
Chelsea were denied their first ever cup success at Wembley. Their 1970  winning team took the trophy in an Old Trafford replay against Leeds.
McLair replaced Kanchelskis with just five minutes to go and took full  advantage of his chance with a fitting finale.
