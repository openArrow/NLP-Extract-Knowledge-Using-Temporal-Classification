British retail sales rose 0.4 percent in April on  the previous month, and lifted an encouraging 4.4 percent over the year, the  central statistical office (CSO) said Thursday.
The figures were better than expected -- analysts had predicted the  monthly figures would remain stable or show a rise of only 0.1 percent --  quelling fears that economic recovery might not be sustained because of large  tax increases in April.
A Treasury spokesman said the April figures showed a "healthy economic  recovery."
March retail sales rose a revised 0.6 percent from February, originally  reported as up 0.8 percent, and lifted 3.8 percent on the year.
