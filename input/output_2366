Japan's index of mining and manufacturing rose 4.6  percent in March from the preceding month while that of shipments gained 4.8  percent, according to a revised government report Friday.
The index of inventories declined 1.1 percent month-to-month but it "still  remained at a high level despite moves of inventory adjustment," the ministry  of international trade and industry said.
It added that the ratio of inventories to sales dropped 5.3 percent.
The output and shipment increases in March were revised upward from  earlier estimates of 3.3 percent and 3.9 percent as production and  distribution of pharmaceuticals, beer and printing machines turned out to be  more brisk, the ministry said.
But the ministry said the monthly gains were mainly attributed to seasonal  factors because manufacturers stepped up production before the closing of  their books at the end of the fiscal year on March 31.
It expected month-to-month declines in production and shipments in April  and May.
In the year to March 31, the output index dropped 4.0 percent from the  preceding year and the shipment index fell 3.6 percent, the ministry said.
The inventory index also decreased 3.4 percent with the inventory-sale  ratio up 1.0 percent.
