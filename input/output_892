Moscow's provisional budget allocation for Russia's  strategic nuclear forces only covers 10 percent of the total sum required,  ITAR-TASS quoted military experts as saying Monday.
The military has for weeks been campaigning for a greater net allocation  of budget funds.
The head of the defence ministry's finance section, General Vasily  Vorobiov, said the provisional military share was "insufficient to pay arms  producers and to continue to finance scientific projects in strategic fields."
The 1994 budget adopted by deputies on the bill's first reading in  parliament last week foresees 37,000 billion roubles (20 billion dollars), or  almost 20 percent of total expenditure, for military purposes. But Vorobiov  believes this figure will "not guarantee the survival of the Russian army."
Military officials are demanding at least 55,000 billion roubles, a sum  Finance Minister Yuri Dubinin has called simply "unrealistic".
