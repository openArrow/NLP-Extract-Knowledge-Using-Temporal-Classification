Russia's partnership in an international  military alliance would bring greater unity and security to Europe, General  John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Saturday.
Shalikashvili said Russia's membership in the Partnership for Peace, an  alliance of former Warsaw Pact nations coordinated with the North American  Treaty Organization (NATO), "will remove one more reason for them (Russia) to  feel somehow on the outside, separated."
"It will give them an opportunity to join with NATO and the other partners  for peace in trying to build one single Europe instead of reinforcing new  lines of division or conflict" he said during an interview with CNN's  "Newsmaker Saturday" television program.
NATO and Russian negotiators spent this week discussing Russia's entry  into the Partnership for Peace.
Among other points, Russia has said it wants a special consideration for  its status in the partnership based on its standing as a nuclear superpower.
Members of the former Warsaw Pact -- a Cold War military alliance of East  European nations and the Soviet Union -- have voiced concerns Russia would use  the alliance to exert control over them.
During talks this week, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said Moscow  is seeking a NATO response to its proposals, notably on creating a mechanism  for consultation on security issues worldwide, and on increased military and  political cooperation.
NATO wants to give a quick answer to the proposals put forward by Russia  before it will sign the Partnership for Peace program, NATO deputy secretary  general Sergio Balanzino said Friday.
