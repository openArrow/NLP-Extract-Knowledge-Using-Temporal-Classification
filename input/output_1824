University students hijacked 20 buses they  claimed were not charging student fares, diverting them to their campus where  scores of youths torched most of the vehicles and rioted, officials said.
Five people were injured in the melee at the University of San Luis Potosi  350 kilometers (215 miles) northwest of Mexico City, university spokeswoman  Pilar Delgadillo said.
Members of the student union forced the buses to take them to the campus  parking lots, where several bus drivers arrived, apparently with dozens of  supporters in tow, and squared off with about 200 students, Delgadillo said.
The two groups clashed, using sticks and stones.
Televisa television reported that molotov cocktails also were used in the  fight.
At least five people were injured and were taken to Red Cross facilities,  officials said.
Police finally brought the battle under control, but there was no  immediate report of any arrests.
