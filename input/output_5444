The latest model to roll off German tennis'  production line was revealed to the world on Monday when Hendrik Dreekmann  motored past Aaron Krickstein in straight sets to reach the French Open  quarter finals.
The 19-year-old from Bielefeld,  restored national pride against the man  who dumped Michael Stich out of competition with a one-sided 6-4, 6-4, 6-4  victory.
The powerful teenager, whose only previous achievement of note was a final  appearance at Sun City earlier in the year, now has a great chance of reaching  the semi-finals when he plays Magnus Larsson on Wednesday.
Although Dreekmann has benefited from a favourable draw and the demise of  all the seeds in his quarter, his run nevertheless represents a remarkable  achievement for a player who came into the tournament having lost his previous  five matches on clay and never having won a grand slam match.
"I would never have expected this. It is unbelievable," he said. "My coach  told me the tournament was two weeks long and if I went out early I could have  a holiday before I play on grass at Rosmalen next week.
"I might miss my holiday but I'd still much rather play well here."
Although he was just beginning to play club tennis when Boris Becker won  the first of his Wimbledon titles in 1985, Dreekmann says it was not his  example that inspired him to try and make a career in tennis.
"I never thought of being like anybody else. I just played for myself."
Dreekmann's shock run rescued what was threatening to be a miserable men's  tournament for the German fans.
Stich was routed by Krickstein in the second round. Becker was forced to  withdraw with a bad back and Marc Goellner lost in the first round to Canada's  Greg Rusedski.
