The United States plans to discuss missiles and  chemical weapons with North Korea in talks with the communist country, a  senior US official was quoted as saying here Thursday.
"Certainly we would want to bring up the other issues that are of concern  to us, in particular the missile issue and the chemical issue," John Holum,  director of the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, said in an interview  with Kyodo News Service.
The US official was quoted as saying that his agency was in particular  "very concerned about both of those issues."
North Korea test-fired its Rodong-1 missile, capable of hitting most parts  of Japan, over the Sea of Japan in May last year.
Holum said he believed that the communist country was developing longer  range missiles.
"This gives an added urgency to addressing the nuclear issue, as well as  other weapons of mass destruction, because we're talking about weapons with a  substantially greater range," he said in the interview.
It was not clear exactly when the United States wanted to discuss North  Korean missiles and chemical weapons, nor was it known if they would be  brought up in a third round of high-level talks with the communist country,  reportedly set for early June.
The second and third rounds of such talks last June and July centered on  North Korea's suspected nuclear development program.
Holum added that it remained unclear whether the third round would be held  in June as reported.
"We're not sure that there will be a third round because there is the  precondition of continuity of safeguards knowledge about the unclear  facilities," he said.
Five inspectors from the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) are now in North Korea to check its Yongbyon experimental nuclear plant  and for talks on nuclear safeguards.
The arrival of the IAEA inspectors in North Korea followed the communist  country's unilateral replacement of fuel rods at the Yongbyon plant with no  IAEA experts being present.
