Raids by the Angolan air force on the rebel UNITA  stronghold city of Huambo have killed at least 39 civilians, left about 100  injured, and caused major damage, UNITA's Radio Vorgan reported Tuesday.
The government's planes dropped four napalm bombs in air strikes on the  city in the central highlands on Monday, following attacks on Sunday, and also  dropped charges containing unidentified chemical substances, the radio said.
The central hospital was short of medicines and equipment to treat the  casualties, the radio added.
It said that the home of UNITA spokesman Jorge Valentim, who is chief  rebel negotiator at peace talks under way since November, was destroyed, but  there was no damage to military targets.
General Arlindo Chienda Pena, known as 'Ben Ben,' the chief of staff of  the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), called the  raids "cowardly bombings" in a statement released on Monday.
The Angolan general staff meanwhile said government troops had seized two  places in Cuanza-Sul province, Lussumbu and Chongola, from UNITA, as well as a  village in the central Bie province, near the embattled town of Kuito. Some 10  UNITA soldiers were killed in the latter attack, it stated.
Radio Vorgan also said government planes had attacked UNITA-held Ndala and  Tchaka-Sau in the eastern diamond-mining Lunda-Norte province, killing 23  people and wounding 47 others.
Angola plunged back into a post-independence civil war after UNITA lost  UN-supervised general elections to the ruling, formerly Marxist People's Front  for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) in September 1992.
