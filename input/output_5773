Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin announced  he has given orders not to let PLO secret police chief Jibril Rajoub leave  Jericho after he vowed to pursue the armed struggle against Israel.
"I gave orders on Monday to restrict his movements and to stop him from  leaving Jericho," state radio quoted Rabin as saying.
The premier reportedly told parliament's defence and foreign affairs  committee that he took the decision after an inflammatory speech by Rajoub at  the Beduin village of Laqiyah in the Negev desert.
"We will continue to fight until the creation of a state with Jerusalem as  its capital," the secret police chief of the autonomous West Bank enclave  reportedly said on Friday. He also demanded that Israel pull out of the  eastern sector of the city.
The Palestinian police could not be contacted immediately for a reaction.
After the committee meeting Rabin re-iterated to reporters that the new  Palestinian authority must site its institutions in Jericho and not Jerusalem.  He claimed the peace agreements stipulate that.
"I am not talking about the Jerusalem institutions for the people living  in Jerusalem. The place for everything linked to the Palestinian authority is  Jericho. I hope they will do it otherwise we will help them."
However the peace agreements hammered out in Oslo and Cairo do not specify  that autonomy institutions have to be put in the West Bank enclave.
The debate followed a warning from Rabin on Friday against any PLO move to  turn Jerusalem into its self-rule headquarters.
However the PLO leader in Jerusalem, Faisal Husseini, hit back on Monday  vowing to keep the Palestinian headquarters in the holy city whatever Israel  says.
Israel captured the eastern sector of Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East  war and united the city as its eternal capital.
