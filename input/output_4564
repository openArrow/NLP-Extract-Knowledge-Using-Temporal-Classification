A 23-year-old student was arrested here for killing  his parents, who were found stabbed and burned to death a week ago in the  southern suburbs of the South Korean capital, police said Friday.
Park Han-Sang confessed to the double murder during a police interrogation  Thursday, saying that he didn't want to wait until his wealthy parents died to  collect his inheritance valued at over 10 billion won (12.5 million dollars).
Park told police in a statement that his parents had called him back from  a US university because he had become a habitual gambler, and threatened to  stop him from returning to Fresno, California, where he owed 23,000 US dollars  in gambling debts.
He said in the statement that he first stabbed his parents in the neck and  limbs while they were sleeping, then poured a can of kerosine over the bodies  and set them alight to make the murders look accidental.
"I remembered seeing a similar crime in a movie. I set the house on fire  to disguise it like a robbery," he told reporters.
