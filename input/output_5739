France said Tuesday it supported sanctions against  North Korea if it continues refusing to submit to nuclear control checks  requested by the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Foreign ministry spokesman Richard Duque said Paris hailed the UN Security  Council's unanimous adoption Monday night of a declaration urging North Korea  to allow full international inspection of its nuclear facilities, which  Washington suspects are used to produce weapons.
The Security Council statement stopped short of threatening sanctions  against Pyongyang which China, North Korea's traditional ally and which has  veto power on the council, has said it opposes.
Duque said the Security Council statement "given the urgency of the  situation was a clear signal" to North Korea for Pyongyang to "conform."
Should North Korea "persist in its refusal," Paris is "ready to consider  the adoption by the Security Council of sanctions against Pyongyong."
The Council's consensus statement urged immediate consultations between  the IAEA and North Korea about Pyongyang's refuelling of the controversial  Yongbyon nuclear reactors.
North Korea is suspected of having diverted plutonium from Yongbyon, 90  kilometers (56 miles) north of the capital, for nuclear weapons production and  of trying to prevent any attempt at verification.
