Rival Kurdish factions are observing a  ceasefire in most areas of northern Iraq but fresh clashes have broken out  near the Iranian border.
The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and Kurdistan Democratic Party  (KDP) said the situation was calm on Sunday in the Arbil region, at the centre  of Iraqi Kurdistan.
But fighting between the two groups was reported from Halabja and Qalat  Diza, villages near the Iranian border.
The Iraqi National Congress, a coalition of Kurdish and Arab groups  opposed to President Saddam Hussein, brokered a ceasefire agreement on Friday.
A hospital source said nine PUK and five KDP fighters were killed before  the latest ceasefire came into effect, while the PUK said the death toll was  more than 20.
At least 100 people were killed in a previous round of fighting earlier  this month that split the Kurdish region into PUK and KDP zones.
The two groups have jointly run the north, in defiance of Baghdad but with  a security umbrella from Western air forces, since an uprising which followed  the 1991 Gulf War.
The renewed fighting came despite a UN warning on May 16 that it could  halt the flow of international aid to the Kurds unless the bloodshed was  stopped.
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, whose country borders northern Iraq,  said Monday that Ankara would contact the rival groups to bring about a peace  settlement.
"We have been watching over the balance of power" in the Kurdish region  "and this should not be broken," he warned, quoted by the Anatolian news  agency.
Demirel noted that the US, British and French warplanes patrolling the air  exclusion zone set up in July 1991 to protect the Kurds from Iraqi forces  operated from Incirlik air base in southeast Turkey.
