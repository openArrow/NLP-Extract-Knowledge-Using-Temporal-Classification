Lesotho Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle has told some  2,500 striking policemen in the tiny southern African kingdom that they would  be fired unless they returned to work by Tuesday.
Mokhele made the announcement in a television broadcast Monday, telling  the strikers that they could consider themselves unemployed unless their  eight-day action ended immediately.
Soldiers have been patrolling the streets of the capital after looting  followed the strike by the junior policemen, who make up more than 80 percent  of the force.
Lesotho's government has been battling a series of crises and was rocked  in January and April by fighting between rival army factions.
Mokhele closed the door on negotiations with the police strikers during  Monday's broadcast and threatened to withdraw an amnesty pledge made during  earlier talks.
The government and strikers had agreed to seven out of eight demands,  including a decision that no policemen would be prosecuted for taking part in  the strike.
Talks broke down over the policemen's demand for a 60 percent pay hike,  which the government rejected as unaffordable given Lesotho's weak economy.
