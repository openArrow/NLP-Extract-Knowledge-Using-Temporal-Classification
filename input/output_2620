Tom Lehman, who let the Masters slip from his  fingers, says that experience will benefit him as he chases his first  tournament title on the US PGA Tour.
Lehman carded a flawless 67 Friday to take a two-stroke lead at the  halfway stage of The Memorial at 10-under 134.
"I learned that my game is sound enough to stand up that kind of  pressure," he said of his experience at Augusta last month. "I fel I am strong  enough emotionally, my swing is sound enough, to withstand the pressure."
At least a few of the game's big names are out of the way this weekend.  England's Nick Faldo carded a 74 to miss the cut with a two-round total of 150.
Tournament founder Jack Nicklaus had three double-bogeys in a 77 for 152,  missing the cut in his own tournament for the second time.
John Cook an David Edwards shared second place on 136. Cook had his second  straight bogey-free round, carding a 69. Edwards, who won here two years ago,  birdied four of the last five holes en route to a 67.
Ben Crenshaw (66) and Donnie Hammond (69) were next on 138.
Mark Brooks, who led Thursday with a superb 64, jumped to 75 for 139,  level with Bob Estes (68) and Australian Greg Norman (69).
Norman birdied five of the last six holes and said: "I don't know why that  happened, but all of a sudden something clicked."
