Vietnam has denied any territorial ambitions against  Cambodia following claims by King Norodom Sihanouk that Hanoi was nibbling  away at its neighbour by slowing moving border markers.
"Vietnam has never had ambitions for Cambodia's territory and always  scrupulously implements all agreements signed on border and territories  between the two countries," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
In an interview with the Far Eastern Economic Review King Sihanouk accused  Vietnam of "moving border markers deeper into our territory."
"Now the border markers are walking, they are walking towards the west ...  they know we cannot take care of two fronts simultaneously," the king said,  describing the situation as "terrible."
Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 to oust the Khmer Rouge regime which  had launched many attacks across the frontier. Hanoi pulled its troops out in  1989 ahead of the implementation of a peace plan and elections.
Phnom Penh has treated Hanoi's denials of territorial ambitions warily as  over the last two centuries, Vietnam has pushed further into what was once  Cambodian territory.
