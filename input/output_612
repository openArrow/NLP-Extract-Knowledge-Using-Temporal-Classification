Pro-democracy movements converged on central  Bangkok Sunday to mark the second anniversary of a May uprising which brought  down Thailand's last military-backed regime.
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai led a wreath-laying ceremony at the Democracy  Monument, a center of pro-democracy protests in May 1992 which degenerated  into bloody clashes between security forces and demonstrators.
Official figures showed 52 people died and another 40 are still officially  listed as missing in riots which, for the first time, had brought Thailand's  emerging middle class into the streets alongside students and politicians.
Police were out in force Sunday as an estimated 2,000 demonstrators  answered a call from the Confederation for Democracy to take part in three  separate marathons ahead of the ceremony at Democracy Monument.
Several events were scheduled in coming days, including a candlelight  ceremony at Democracy Monument at midnight May 18 in memory of those who died.
In February 1991, citing allegations of rampant corruption in the civilian  government, General Suchinda Kraprayoon headed a bloodless military coup which  overthrew Prime Minister Chatichai Choohaven.
After the National Peace-Keeping Council (NPKC) organized elections in  March 1992, Suchinda, who had pledged to stand down, was nonetheless appointed  prime minister, triggering the first of a weeks-long series of protests.
Numbering up to 200,000 by May 1992, demonstrators defied a ban on rallies  to press demands for a return to democracy. Serious clashes on May 19 left  several dead and thousands under arrest.
Thailand's respected monarch, Bhumibol Adulyadej, intervened on May 21,  leading to Suchinda's resignation three days later. Elections were held the  following September.
