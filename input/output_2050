The dollar was mixed against other major  currencies in quiet trading here early Thursday and was expected to decline  the rest of the day.
Gold, meanwhile, rose to 383.60 dollars an ounce, up 1.60 dollars from  late Wednesday.
At about 9:40 a.m. (1340 GMT), the dollar traded at 1.6560 German marks,  down from 1.6535 several hours earlier in London and from 1.6570 late  Wednesday.
Against the yen, it was at 104 yen, up from 103.45 in London, unchanged  from the late Wednesday level in New York.
The dollar fell to 5.6640 French francs from 5.6710 late Wednesday, was  unchanged at 1.4085 Swiss francs, and rose to 0.6630 pound sterling (0.6629).
"The dollar should continue to go down another 30 or 40 points before the  end of the day," said Joe Cambria, of Paribas bank.
Cambria said the dollar's decline would not be enough to provoke  intervention by central banks.
