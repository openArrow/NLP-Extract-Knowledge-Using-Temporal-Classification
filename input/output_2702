Flags were flying at half-mast in the small  town of Pont-Saint-Esprit in southern France Saturday to mark the death of  Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, whose Bouvier ancestors lived there.
Mayor Gilbert Baumet said he would propose renaming a street and the town  hall's reception room after the former first lady of the United States, who  died in New York Thursday.
Pont-Saint-Esprit, which nestles beside the Rhone, already has a Kennedy  Avenue, named for the assassinated US president.
A mass will be held in Onassis's honour Monday at the Saint-Saturnin  church, and a delegation will visit Paris to sign the condolence book at the  US embassy.
A framed letter from Onassis takes pride of place in the mayor's office.  She wrote it on March 11, 1961, to thank the town "from the bottom of my  heart" for the picture the town sent her and John Kennedy as a wedding present.
Onassis's direct ancestors left Pont-Saint-Esprit just before the American  Civil War broke out in 1861, but many Bouvier relations remain.
