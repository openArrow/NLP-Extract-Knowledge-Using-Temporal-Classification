France's Alcatel on Monday won Telekom  Malaysia's first foreign contract to set up a global telephone network in Sri  Lanka, which the Malaysian firm is to run on a joint-venture with Colombo's  Maharaja Organisation Ltd.
Alcatel is to supply and maintain the Global System for Mobile  Communications (GSM) for MTN Network Pte. Ltd. -- a Telekom-Maharaja company  -- under a five-year deal worth 25 million ringgit (10 million dollars).
"The service would be launched at the end of the year and will link Sri  Lanka to 51 other GSM operating countries," Mohamed Said Mohamed Ali, managing  director of Telekom Malaysia, told reporters.
Mohamed Said commented that the Sri Lankan GSM contract, which enabled  mobile telephone owners in Colombo to use their phones in other GSM-linked  countries, was the first overseas venture to be implemented by Telekom  Malaysia, Kuala's Lumpur national telephone firm.
He said the company expected to operate paging services in six Indian  cities by September through a tie-up with India's Usha Martin Industries Ltd.
Mohamed Said stated that Telekom Malaysia and Usha Martin had also won a  tender for another GSM project in India, but the venture had been delayed by a  lawsuit from another "unhappy" bidder who questioned the deal awarded by the  Indian Telecoms Department.
"We are expecting a decision on the lawsuit soon and, in the meantime, are  exploring investment opportunities in Bangladesh, China and Indonesia," he  said, adding that the proposed ventures were in advanced negotiations.
Alcatel manager for Asia-Pacific Dany Liszkowski said the Sri Lankan  project was the fifth GSM venture for the company in the region and 18th in  the world.
"We have about 2.7 million subscribers on this service so far and are  scouting for more," Liszkwoski said.
Alcatel last year clinched a deal to provide Telekom Malaysia with 800,000  ground telephone lines over the next five years.
