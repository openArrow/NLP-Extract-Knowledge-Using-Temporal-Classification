Paris St Germain have been barred from signing any  new players just a week after winning the French league championship because  they are too heavily indebted.
The French league's financial watchdog, the DNCG, refused to publish any  figures.
However, league president Noel Le Graet said he expected the club to be  able to submit new accounts next week which should convince the DNCG to lift  its ban.
Paris St Germain's vice-president Michel Denisot had already said the club  would make no major signings next season.
The feeling was the club was living beyond its means as Paris mayor  Jacques Chirac only two weeks ago renewed backing worth 100 million francs  over three years.
Canal Plus, the cable television firm, is also a major backer.
Paris recently terminated the contract of their Portuguese coach Artur  Jorge who was reportedly on 600,000 francs a month.
He led them to the French Cup and league title in successive years but was  criticised for his negative tactics.
Brazil's World Cup captain Rai is one of three highly-paid Brazilians in  the team.
