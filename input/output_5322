A wave of executions and tough prison sentences  meted out Sunday mark a "victory" in the fight against corruption, the  People's Daily declared Monday, ahead of the fifth anniversary of the  Tiananmen Square massacre.
Without mentioning the bloodshed or the anniversary directly, the  Communist Party daily made it clear that the tough measures were aimed at  rooting out the social evil that was also a trigger for the 1989 mass protests.
"The facts prove that nobody, however high his position, is above the  law," the paper said in a front-page editorial that was also published in all  the major Chinese newspapers.
Twelve party cadres and policemen in the coastal provinces of Shandong,  eastern China, and Guangdong, in the south of the country, were sentenced on  counts of graft and smuggling totalling several million dollars.
Four were executed immediately after the verdict, and the eight others  were jailed from three years to life.
The high-profile coverage of the trial, together with the security clamp  that has been tightened around Beijing, testify to the authorities'  nervousness in the run-up to the anniversary this Saturday of the crushing of  the pro-democracy movement, observers here say.
The editorial said: "The criminal activity of smuggling, linked to  corruption among officials, is a serious economic problem, but also a major  political issue."
"If we do not severely punish these cases, public indignation will not be  stilled," it said, describing Sunday's sentencing as a "victory" in a nearly  year-old drive against corruption that has entailed hundreds of arrests and  executions.
In an article in the Legal Daily, Liang Guoqing, vice president of the  supreme public prosecutor's office, on Monday called on courts to hand down  tougher sentences against corrupt officials but also against all common-law  criminal.
"The legal institutions must emphasise protection for social and political  stability," Liang said.
