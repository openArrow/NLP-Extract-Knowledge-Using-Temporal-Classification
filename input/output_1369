Russia Tuesday expressed concern over reports that  Uzbekistan authorities had arrested two opposition leaders and two human  rights activists to keep them from attending a human rights conference in  Kazakhstan.
Foreign ministry spokesman Grigory Karasin said that "if the reports were  true, it would be necessary to examine the conformity of these actions with  the Commonwealth charter, the CIS declaration on human rights as well as UN  and CSCE documents that provide for strict observation of human rights and  freedoms."
The statement came after reports that two leaders of the opposition  movement Birlik in Uzbekistan were arrested along with Mikhail Ardzinov,  leader of a human rights group and Mamura Usmanova, who heads a women's rights  group.
The four were to attend a conference on human rights in Central Asia this  week organised by a Russian-US human rights association.
Uzbek security and police forces last year crossed into neighboring  Kyrgyzstan to apprehend and arrest Uzbek human rights activist Abdumanob  Pulatov who attended the annual conference.
"Human rights organisations are a necessary element of any democratic  society," Karasin said.
"Russia will defend this principle in its relations with all foreign  states, including Commonwealth republics."
