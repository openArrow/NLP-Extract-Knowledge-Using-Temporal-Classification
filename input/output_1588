Peace talks between Sudan's Islamic fundamentalist  military government and southern, mainly Christian rebels were delayed for a  third day Wednesday as rebel representatives failed to turn up, officials said.
Government negotiators and delegates from one of the two rival factions of  the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) have been waiting in Nairobi since  Monday for the Kenyan-chaired meeting to open.
On Tuesday a spokesman for the mainstream SPLA faction led by John Garang  said its negotiators were "bogged down" wading through steamy swamps in  southern Sudan on their way to Kenya.
The spokesman, Stephen Wondu, said Wednesday that the delegation was  travelling by foot because government warplanes had bombed Chukudum airstrip  in southeastern Sudan, from where the rebel officials had planned to fly to  the talks in Nairobi.
The planned talks here are the latest in a series of so far fruitless  efforts by a six-member regional group to broker a peaceful settlement to the  decades-old conflict between Arabised northern Sudan and the African, mostly  animist and Christian south.
Despite the failure of Garang's representatives to show up, a visiting  official of his faction signed an agreement here Tuesday guaranteeing safe  passage for relief supplies to the south, a vast undeveloped territory of  swampland and savannah, racked by war and famine.
The aid accord was also signed by officials of the breakaway SPLA-United  faction led by Garang's former deputy Riek Mashar, the Khartoum government and  Operation Lifeline Sudan, a United Nations umbrella group that coordinates aid  to the south.
Sudan's slow and painful peace process is being sponsored by the  six-member Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD),  which groups Kenya, Uganda, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Sudan.
