The memoirs of former East German leader Erich  Honecker, who died in Chile at the weekend, will be published in June, his  publishing house said Monday.
The memoirs, written during Honecker's imprisonment in Berlin and entitled  "Notes from Moabit" -- the prison where he was held from July 1992 to January  1993 -- are a last declaration of faith in the communist ideals he espoused  right up to his death Sunday.
"The fall of the German Democratic Republic has deeply saddened me, but it  has not removed my faith in socialism as the only alternative for a just and  human society," he wrote in the 300-page manuscript, his publishing house  Edition Ost said.
"Ever since the existence of capitalism, communists have been among the  world's persecuted, but there is a future for them," he wrote.
Honecker's remains were to be incinerated Monday and his ashes will remain  in Chile at his family's request. But Honecker's lawyer in Berlin, Nicolas  Becker, said the family was considering returning the ashes to Germany.
Honeker died at the age of 81 following a long fight against cancer.
The former East German president and leader of his country's communist  party wished to be buried in the family mausoleum near Neunkirchen. Local  officials said Monday, however, that the 25-year lease on the tomb expired at  the end of April and therefore his ashes could not be buried there.
Dieter Vogel, the German government spokesman, said Bonn would not oppose  a return of Honecker's remains.
Honecker, who ruled East Germany with an iron fist between 1971 and 1989,  sought refuge in the Soviet Union after the Berlin Wall fell on November 10,  1989 before returning to Germany in July 1992 to stand trial for his part in  the deaths of those killed at the Wall while trying to escape to the West.
He was released in January 1993 on grounds of ill health, his doctors  having given him up to six months to live.
