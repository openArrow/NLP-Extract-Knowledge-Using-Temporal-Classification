The independent British carrier Air UK protested  Tuesday at the "arbitrary and discriminatory" conditions set by French  Transport Minister Bernard Bosson for flights from London to Paris-Orly, the  airport south of the French capital.
Managing director Andrew Gray said in a statement received here that the  conditions appeared to have been set deliberately to make the route non-viable  for operators such as Air UK.
On Monday British Airways and its subsidiary TAT also protested against  the restrictions, and TAT threatened to protest to the European Union.
Air UK also criticised a restriction due to come into effect in a year  that stops aircraft with under 200 seats from using the peak-hour Paris-Orly  slots. The company said it would fight the restrictions "by all means  possible."
