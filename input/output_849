Police arrested some 70 hooligans on  Sunday night who vandalised a bar after a football match in Dessau, in former  East Germany, a spokesman said Monday.
Security forces intervened when drunken fans started smashing bottles and  setting off firecrackers after the match.
Nobody was injured and damage was not extensive.
The vandals came from Halle and Leipzig. They were released after  questioning and identity checks and put on trains for those cities, where  local police were on standby for their arrival to prevent further trouble.
