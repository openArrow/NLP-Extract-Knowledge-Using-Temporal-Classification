Deputy German Foreign Minister Ursula  Seiler-Albring will head a mission to the Philippines on Thursday to discuss  bilateral ties and relations between the European Union and ASEAN, an embassy  statement issued here Wednesday said.
Seiler-Albring, who has the rank of state minister, will be accompanied by  Klaus Zeller, head of the ministry's Asian division, it said.
She will meet President Fidel Ramos, House Speaker Jose De Venecia and the  trade and foreign affairs secretaries.
Aside from bilateral relations, the meeting is intended to pave the way  for a ministerial meeting to be held in Karlsruhe, Germany, in September,  between the EU and ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
The Philippines, along with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and  Thailand, is a member of ASEAN.
The visit, whose duration was not disclosed, will also serve to implement  "the new Asia concept," of German foreign policy, focusing on deepening  relations with Asian nations, the German embassy added.
