Michael Laudrup said Monday he was leaving  Barcelona but the Danish international refused to say who he would play for  next season.
He would not comment on reports that he had already signed for Real Madrid.
Laudrup, 30 next month, did not play in last week's European Cup final  when Barcelona were outclassed by AC Milan.
Barcelona coach Johan Cruyff was also understood to have released  goalkeeper
Antoni Zubizaretta. The 32-year-old has won 86 Spanish caps.
