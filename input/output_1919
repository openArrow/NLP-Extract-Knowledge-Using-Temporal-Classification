Malaysian Premier Mahathir Mohamad charged  Thursday that European countries were seeking to lift minimum wage levels in  developing nations as a ploy to overcome their own economic problems.
"They actually want the workers of the developing countries to (make a)  sacrifice to ensure that they (European countries) maintain their high living  standards," Mahathir said.
He said Europe had become unable to lure investment and create jobs  because of the huge gap between salaries in Europe and developing countries.
"In fact, the European countries can bring down their minimum wage levels,  but this would mean sacrificing their living standards," Mahathir said. "So,  they are now proposing to compel us to raise our minimum wage levels to  overcome their unemployment problem."
Mahathir said that the Group of Seven (G7) rich countries had held many  meetings to address European woes, especially unemployment levels which in  some countries had reached 12 percent, "but to no avail."
Britain, France, Germany and Italy are the European countries in the G7,  which also includes the United States, Japan and Canada.
Mahathir said developing countries had to be wary about raising wages for  workers because they might lose their competitive edge and be overwhelmed by  inflation.
At a GATT ministerial conference in Marrakesh, Morocco last month,  Malaysia and other developing countries voiced fears that a bid to include  labour rights in the new World Trade Organisation (WTO) could be used by  industrial nations as a pretext for new forms of protectionism.
This was in response to pressure, mainly from the United States and  France, for the WTO agenda to link trade and workers' rights.
The WTO will replace the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT), which has operated on an interim basis since 1947, and will have  greater enforcement power in international trading relations.
