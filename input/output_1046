Israeli settlers and troops  shot and wounded 16 Palestinians in the mosque massacre town of Hebron on  Monday in full view of international observers.
A spokesman for the observers, known as the Temporary International  Presence in Hebron, said the violence erupted as settlers leaving their  settlement near the Tomb of the Patriarchs fired at Palestinian youths.
The clash occurred near the site where a Jewish extremist killed 30 Moslem  worshippers on February 25. Spokesman Bjarne Soerensen said the settlers  opened fire "in full view" of the observers.
Hospital sources said eight Palestinians were shot and another beaten up.
After the initial clash, troops also shot eight Palestinian demonstrators,  including a youth who was in serious condition with a bullet wound in the  neck, the sources said.
The observer team, deployed in Hebron a week ago to bolster security for  Palestinians in the wake of the mosque killings, was gathering eyewitness  accounts, Soerensen said.
It was the worst incident in Hebron since the deployment of the 160-men  force from Denmark, Italy and Norway.
Palestinian sources had reported initially that Israeli border guards  intervened and shot the Palestinians as they and the settlers hurled stones at  each other.
But an Israeli army spokesman said the settlers, who were on foot at a  crossroads, shot about a dozen Palestinians after coming under attack from  stone-throwers.
