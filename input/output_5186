Burnley beat nine-man Stockport County 2-1 in a  dramatic match at Wembley on Sunday to clinch promotion to the English first  division.
Six players were also booked in a stormy encounter that saw County play  out the last half-hour two men short.
They had taken the lead after four minutes after Chris Beaumont glanced a  header past Burnley goalkeeper Marlon Beresford.
But things soon turned sour as full-back Michael Wallace was sent-off by  referee David Elleray for stamping.
Stockport were undone again by their indiscipline in the second half, this  time goal-scorer Beaumont getting the red card for stamping on Burnley  full-back Les Thompson.
Burnley had levelled in the 29th minute when David Eyres picked up the  ball on the right, skipped superbly past three tackles and shot low into the  corner.
The winner came in the 65th minute when Deary's cross was not cleared and  full-back Gary Parkinson shot home from the edge of the box despite Keeley  getting both hands to the ball.
