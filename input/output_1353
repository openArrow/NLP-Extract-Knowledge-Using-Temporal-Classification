Bosnian Serbs fired at least seven shells at  Tuzla airport in northern Bosnia-Hercegovina Tuesday shortly after the first  UN plane in a month landed on the northern airstrip, a UN spokesman said here.
The plane immediately took off after the first shells landed arund 2:00  p.m. (1200 GMT), UN Protection Force spokesman Dacre Holloway said.
There were no casualties and the aircraft was not damaged after two shells  crashed onto the runway and the remainder dropped nearby.
Holloway said the Ilyushin aircraft had been able to take off safely and  land at the Croatian port of Split.
Holloway added he did not know of a UN response to the attack on the plane  but said the UN had not asked NATO for air support.
The plane was carrying a Jordanian battalion of specially trained UN  soldiers, along with US-made radar-tracking equipment due to be deployed in  Tuzla to monitor mortar trajectories.
The mainly Moslem Bosnian army handed over control of the airport to the  UNPROFOR on March 22 after Russia put diplomatic pressure on the Serbs to  allow the airlifting of humanitarian aid into the region.
Since then 22 planes have landed at the airport carrying equipment for  peacekeepers. The last flight was on April 14.
