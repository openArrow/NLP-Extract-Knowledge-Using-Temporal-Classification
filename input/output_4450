Recently-discovered manuscripts by 17th-century  English composer Henry Purcell, including music not played for 300 years, sold  for a record 276,500 pounds (414,750 dollars) at Sotheby's, London, Thursday.
The sum, paid by an anonymous bidder, was a world auction record for any  British music manuscript.
But as the auction house pointed out: "It is considered to be the most  important music manuscript by a British-born composer, and indeed the only  major manuscript by any 17th-century composer to appear at auction, probably  since the beginning of the century."
The small calf-bound volume, containing the only keyboard music by Purcell  written in his own hand, came to prominence after a music dealer from Devon in  south-west England bought a bundle of music for "a very small sum" at another  auction last September.
Realising her find, she took it to Sotheby's and her purchase is now  regarded as one of the most-important post-medieval British manuscripts in  existence.
It contains 21 pieces written for harpsichord, some of which have not been  heard for 300 years.
In the same sale, unpublished letters by Carl Jung, in which he explores  and explains his theories of psychoanalysis, sold for 29,900 pounds (44,850  dollars) -- a record for any hand-written Jung material.
