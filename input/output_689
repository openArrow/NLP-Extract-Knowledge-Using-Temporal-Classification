Fighting between Rwandan rebels and government  forces intensified Sunday in several districts of Kigali and in towns across  the country, a UN spokesman in the capital said.
Abdul Kabia, contacted by telephone from Nairobi, reported heavy clashes  between the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and government troops in the eastern  and southeastern suburbs of Remera and Kicukiro.
Mortar shells also fell in the centre of the capital, he said.
Fighting between the Tutsi-led RPF and the Hutu-majority government side  was also raging in Ruhengeri, a northwest town still held by the regular army,  and at Nkumba further to the north, Kabia said. Clashes were also reported at  Bugesera, south of Kigali.
The RPF claimed on Friday it had seizwed control of half the country.
Kabia added that Dutch Cooperation Minister Jan Pronk arrived in the  capital Saturday on a short visit, inspecting the Amaharo stadium and the  Meridien hotel, two refugee centres.
Former French minister for humanitarian action Bernard Kouchner, who  called Saturday on the international community to help avert "genocide" in the  country, was still in Kigali Sunday, Kabia said.
Less than a year after a peace accord was signed by the rebels and the  government, a Rwanda was plunged back into a murderous ethnic war on April 7,  a day after Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in what the  government said was a rocket attack on his plane.
Since then an estimated 200,000 Rwandans have been killed and around  500,000 others have fled to neighbouring countries.
Although the capital's streets are no longer littered with corpses,  observers say that civilians trapped there now face a war of attrition where  weapons, rather than political dialogue, will have the ultimate say.
