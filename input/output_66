Philadelphia first baseman John  Kruk, who missed the first six games of the season after surgery to remove a  cancerous testicle, will have an operation on his right knee on Friday.
Kruk will have arthoscopic surgery to remove loose cartilage from the  joint.
He is expected to miss the next three weeks.
"I couldn't move, I couldn't run," he said. "I wouldn't say it was  affecting the way I hit, but some people said I wasn't coming through on my  front side."
Kruk has averaged .313 with one home run this year. He said the cancer and  the knee problem had made it a tough season so far.
"I know my way around the hospital better than I do the stadium right  now," he said.
