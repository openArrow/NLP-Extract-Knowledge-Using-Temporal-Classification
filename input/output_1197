A US serviceman, sentenced to 15 years' jail for  killing a South Korean bar girl, was taken to a local prison Tuesday after  failing to win a US Supreme Court order to block the transfer, the US military  said.
Private Kenneth Markle III, 21, was taken from a US military jail by  officials of the South Korean Supreme Prosecutor's Office and sent to a prison  in the central city of Chonan, the prosecutors office said.
Markle, from West Virginia, had filed an emergency petition on Friday with  the US Supreme Court, saying he feared for his life in a Korean jail and  asking to block the transfer. The court rejected his petition.
The transfer was in accordance with a US-South Korea accord on the legal  status of the 36,000 US troops stationed here, known as the Status of Forces  Agreement.
Markle was arrested for murdering a Korean bar hostess in October 1992  near a US military base in Pyongtaek. He was first sentenced to life, but the  term was reduced to 15 years on appeal.
Four other American servicemen and one serviceman's dependent are  currently serving jail terms in South Korean prisons, US military officials  said.
