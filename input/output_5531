Olympique Marseille president Bernard Tapie  claimed here on Monday he could vouch for the 80 million French Francs (14.2  million dollars) missing from the club's accounts.
Tapie, facing embezzlement charges, was questioned by investigating  magistrate Pierre Philippon for more than four hours and said afterwards he  could answer for the shortfall.
"I accounted for the entire 80 million," he said.
Tapie said the missing money had in fact been paid out as special fees  during several transfers, including that English international Chris Waddle,  who was signed from Tottenham Hotspur.
"Eight million francs was paid to a publicity company which managed  Waddle," he said.
Meanwhile French state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais revealed they had laid  hands on 100 million francs (17.8 million dollars) in Tapie's accounts as hid  creditors tried to recover 220 million dollars worth of debts from the  maverick politician and self-made millionaire.
