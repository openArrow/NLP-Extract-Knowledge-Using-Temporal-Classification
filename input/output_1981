New Zealand Premier James Bolger Thursday  prodded Malaysia, his country's largest Southeast Asian market, to help link a  proposed free trade area in the ASEAN region with a New Zealand-Australia  economic forum.
"As activity between our two regions draws us closer together, it seems to  me that this could be a sensible and worthwhile development," said Bolger, a  day after he arrived here on a three-day visit.
Bolger, addressing a gathering of Malaysian and New Zealand entrepreneurs,  prodded Kuala Lumpur to further consider an initiative by Canberra to merge  the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations (CER) forum with the Asean  Free Trade Area (AFTA).
Australia won approval from the Association of South East Asian Nations  (ASEAN) -- which includes Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,  Singapore and Thailand -- early this month for a closer study of a tie-up  between AFTA and CER.
Officials said an AFTA-CER free trade area would link ASEAN 350 billion  dollar economies with the similiarly sized Australian and New Zealand  economies.
It would also create a major trading force in the Pacific and  significantly enhance the economic strength of all members.
Bolger said both CER and AFTA were positive mechanisms for regional  economic growth.
He said AFTA especially suited New Zealand's efforts to strengthen ties  between its business community and Southeast Asia's dynamic entrepreneurs.
The premier said New Zealand viewed Malaysia as its largest market in  Southeast Asia and one its most important neighbours in the Pacific.
"But no matter how well we know a country, business links can always be  further developed," he said.
