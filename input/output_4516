Japanese electronics giant Sharp Corp. said Friday  its consolidated pre-tax earnings dropped 4.2 percent from a year earlier to  49.4 billion yen (480 million dollars) in the year to March.
The Osaka-based company said sales grew 0.8 percent to 1,490 billion yen,  supported by strong sales of electronic components including colour liquid  crystal displays, a market it dominates as the world's biggest producer.
Sharp offered no pre-tax profit forecast for the current year but said net  profit was forecast to jump to 38 billion yen after rising 7.4 percent to 31.7  billion yen in the latest year. Sales are seen falling to 1,580 billion yen.
"The company expects the economy to remain severe at home and abroad in  the current year amid concerns towards the slowdown in capital investment and  the instability in the Japanese politics," it said in a statement.
"Despite some signs of economic recovery, delays in comprehensive economic  measures don't allow us to be optimistic," it said.
Sharp said domestic sales were up 4.2 percent to 744 billion yen in the  latest year while overseas revenue decreased 2.3 percent to 746 billion yen.
Sales of electronic equipment were down 6.7 percent at 340 billion yen and  sales of audio and communication equipment fell 1.5 percent to 149 billion yen.
Electronic machinery sales edged down 3.5 percent to 242 billion yen but  sales of electronic parts jumped 19 percent to 385 billion yen. Sales of  information equipment fell 3.6 percent to 375 billion yen.
