Japan's Kawasaki Steel Corp. said Tuesday it had  sold its troubled wafer fabrication subsidiary in the United States to MEMC  Electronic Materials Inc. for an undisclosed sum.
The wholly-owned unit, Kawasaki Wafer Technology Inc., has reportedly been  losing money for years despite the Japanese steelmaker's investment of at  least 67 million dollars in the Santa Clara-based company.
Kawasaki said the former NBK Inc., whose name was changed five years after  original acquisition in 1985, currently employed some 180 people and had sales  of 20 million dollars a year.
The steelmaker announced plans to sell the subsidiary in February at which  time its wafer production capacity was estimated at 900,000 units a year.  Silicon wafers are the base material from which semiconductors are made.
"It's a highly competitive industry with very low added value," an  electronics industry analyst said.
MEMC, based in Missouri, employees some 4,600 and enjoys annual sales of  600 million dollars with operations in North America, Europe and Asia.
