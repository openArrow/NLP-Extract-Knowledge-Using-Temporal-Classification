Four suspected Colombian drug-traffickers  arrested here in 1992 during an international drug bust have been extradited  for trial in the United States, police said.
The four suspects, aged 24-50, were turned over to US Drug Enforcement  Administration (DEA) agents who flew them out of the country Tuesday.
They will be prosecuted in southern California on 97 charges of drug  trafficking and money laundering, police said.
The Colombians were among some 160 people arrested in several countries on  September 24, 1992, in a coordinated effort by law enforcement agencies from  Europe, Latin America and the United States termed "Green Ice" that also  netted 650 kilograms of cocaine and 55 million dollars in cash.
