Pakistani para-military forces opened  fire Monday on a crowd demanding the enforcement of Islamic law, killing at  least 10 people and injuring 28, witnesses and hospital sources said.
The clash between the militia and demonstrators occurred at Buner, some 80  kilometers (50 miles) from here in northwest Pakistan.
Witnesses said the troops resorted to firing after a baton charge and tear  gas shelling failed to disperse a crowd of hundreds of people.
Buner district lies in the same mountainous region where thousands of  people have blocked roads for the past five days in Malakand to press their  demand that the government implement Shariat rule in the region.
The local addministration at Buner put the casualties at eight killed and  five injured.
In a statement, it said the forces acted in self-defence after  demonstrators started firing on them.
Residents said the area was in the grip of high tension, as authorities  tigthened measures to prevent further outbreaks of violence.
The chief of the fundamentalist Jamaat-i-Islami in the North West Frontier  Province issued a call here for a province-wide general strike on Friday to  protest the killings.
Maulana Sirajul Haq expressed support for the demand of the region's  Pushtun inhabitants for the enforcement of Islamic laws, including the Islamic  penal code.
