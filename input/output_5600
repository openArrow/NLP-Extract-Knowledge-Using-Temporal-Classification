By-elections to six provincial seats in Uttar  Pradesh, India's most populous state, and a sole constituency in northern  Punjab state began Tuesday amid tight security, the Press Trust of India said.
More than 74 battalions of paramilitary troops and police guarded about  2,000 polling centres in Uttar Pradesh as thousands of the estimated 1.2  million voters trickled in from 7.00 a.m. (0130 GMT), state officials said.
Security has been stepped up in 481 "sensitive" booths, officials said in  the Uttar Pradesh capital Lucknow, adding that coded ballot boxes and  independent video coverage of voting were being used for the first time.
The stern measures were ordered by India's tough election chief T.N.Seshan  to curb malpractices in recent by-elections which began last week in 12 of  India's 25 states.
Seshan had deferred the Uttar Pradesh polls, due last Thursday, after  charging chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav with using a government helicopter  for campaigning.
The Uttar Pradesh by-elections are a crucial test for Prime Minister P.V.  Narasimha Rao's Congress (I) party, which lost its former stronghold first to  the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party and then to a socialist-led combine.
The Congress won five of the eight seats at stake in the Lok Sabha, the  lower house of parliament, and five of the 10 state assembly seats in  Thursday's by-elections, but failed to make significant headway in opposition  strongholds.
