Japan's industrial output and shipments in  January-March showed the first gain in four quarters, an official report said  on Wednesday.
But the return to growth could not be taken as a signal for full economic  recovery, an official said.
The ministry of international trade and industry report said the index of  mining and manufacturing rose by 1.5 percent in the three months to March  compared with the preceding quarter and that of industrial shipments gained  1.9 percent.
The rises were largely due to seasonal factors including greater  manufacturing and marketing efforts in the final quarter of the fiscal year to  dress up their accounts, the ministry said.
"We can hardly take the trend in the quarter as a sign of economic  recovery," said an official at the ministry's research and statistics bureau.
He forecast that industrial production would remain stagnant for the time  being as final demand was not brisk enough to boost production.
In January-March, production rose in 11 of the 15 industries, led by the  transport and machinery sectors, which included motor vehicle manufacturers.
Meanwhile, the index of inventories dropped 1.9 percent for the second  consecutive quarter-to-quarter decline while the ratio of inventories to sales  fell 4.2 percent, the first drop in three quarters.
"Inventory adjustment made some progress," the official said.
