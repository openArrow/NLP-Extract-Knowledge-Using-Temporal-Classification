Former Italian prime minister Bettino Craxi  Wednesday branded charges of corruption against him as baseless, fantastic or  absurd, adding that the pressure was worsening his health problems.
Craxi's first press statement since arriving in Tunisia at the beginning  of last week followed an announcement in Milan Tuesday that he would stand  trial on July 5 in connection with the so-called Enimont scandal.
"I am in need of care and my health would be better if I were not in a  continuous state of tension," he said.
Craxi, who suffers from diabetes and circulation problems, is currently  residing in his villa at Hammamet, 60 kilometres (35 miles) from Tunis,  following medical treatment in a clinic here.
Protected by Tunisian police who are preventing a score of Italian  journalists from getting too close to the villa, Craxi is currently engaged in  a battle to prevent the Italian authorities from confiscating his passport.
The former prime minister is one of 32 leading figures from Italy's  political and business establishment due to stand trial for corruption from  July 5 in connection with the high-profile Enimont scandal.
Enimont was a failed merger at the end of the 1980s between state energy  concern ENI and the private Ferruzzi-Montedison conglomerate. An estimated 100  million dollars in bribes to political parties were paid out during its  abortive formation.
Other defendants in the case include Northern League leader Umberto Bossi,  whose movement is part of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's governing  coalition, and former prime minister Arnaldo Forlani.
Involvement in Enimont is only one of the charges weighing on Craxi,  former leader of the Socialist Party and a key figure in the wide-ranging  probe into corruption in Italy.
Others concern illegal kickbacks for his party from contractors to build  the Milan metro and in connection with a staff insurance scheme for ENI.
