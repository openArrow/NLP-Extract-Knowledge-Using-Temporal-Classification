A teenager playing only his fourth county  championship match blocked world number one batsman Brian Lara's attempt at  equalling a world record at Lord's on Friday.
Middlesex paceman Richard Johnson, 19, succeeded where everyone else has  failed this season, by stopping Lara from scoring another first-class century.
Had the West Indian maestro succeeded, he would have joined Don Bradman,  C.B. Fry and Mike Proctor in having scored six successive first class  centuries.
Lara's record bid had started with his world record 375 against England in  April's fifth Test in Antigua, and continued with four centuries after joining  Warwickshire.
Lara scored 26 in tricky conditions but then swished at a delivery  drifting down leg-side and snicked a catch to keeper Keith Brown.
Johnson went on to dimiss Dermot Reeve and Paul Smith as Warwickshire  slipped to 211 all out.
Middlesex lost their own West Indian, Desmond Haynes, in reaching 38 for  one by the close.
Duncan Spencer, Kent's 22-year old English-born, Australian-raised fast  bowler, claimed a career-best four for 31 at Grace Road.
After winning the toss and putting the home side into bat, Kent dismissed  Leicestershire for 204 in 72.1 overs.
But Leicestershire's seam bowlers then hit back, claiming Kent's first  three wickets for 42 runs, before Carl Hooper and Nigel Llong steadied the  ship as the visitors closed at 69 for three.
England A batsman John Crawley hit an incredible 281 to destroy Somerset  at Southport, the seventh highest innings in Red Rose history.
Shell-shocked Somerset were in no state to contend with Wasim Akram after  Lancashire's formidable 521.
He grabbed three wickets in one over, and Somerset will resume on 103 for  five.
