French philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy on Monday  reversed a decision on fielding candidates in forthcoming European elections  on a "Sarajevo" platform, which had thrown mainstream parties into disarray.
His list, made up of French intellectuals and led by cancer specialist  Leon Schwartzenberg, "will not go to the vote," Levy said in a statement.
His supporters would "continue to campaign" but "have decided to pursue  their action in other ways."
Instead of running for seats in the Strasbourg parliament, Levy and his  supporters would set up a national committee called "Vigilance Sarajevo."
Opinion polls showed that the list of Levy, who is a partisan of the  mainly Moslem Bosnian government, could win up to 12 percent of the vote in  France in the June 12 poll.
But this would be achieved notably by taking votes away from mainstream  parties such as the Socialist Party of Michel Rocard.
Levy had said that the aim of fielding candidates had been to ensure that  the debate on the Bosnian conflict was at the heart of the European election  campaign, and had forced both the socialists and right-wing government onto  the defensive.
