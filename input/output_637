Human rights watchdog Amnesty International opened  its first branch in Taiwan Sunday following an improvement in the country's  individual rights.
"The formation of the branch here indicates that our protection of human  rights and elimination of arrest of political prisoners have been acknolwedged  by Amnesty International," Taiwan's Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou, said at the  founding ceremony here.
In future Taiwan would become a "human rights export country," instead of  a "human rights import country," Ma said.
He was referring to the period in the 1960s when thousands of dissidents  were jailed for criticizing the government, prompting Amnesty International  (AI) to ask its members worldwide to express concern over the situation in  Taiwan.
"Now it's time for us to express concern over human rights violations in  other countries, and this makes us a human rights export country," he said,  promising Taiwan would create no more political prisoners in future.
Martial law was imposed in Taiwan in 1949 when the ruling Nationalist  government fled to Taiwan after being defeated by the Chinese communists in a  civil war.
Taiwan, which still considered itself at war with China, enforced the law  until 1987 when relations between the two improved, and in 1990 the government  scrapped a law banning the promotion of independence from China, allowing  exiled dissidents to return to the island.
Previously, most dissidents were imprisoned for advicating the idea of an  independent Taiwan, which the government proscribes. Currently only those  caught using violence to achieve their goal face criminal charges.
Kuo Yi-tung, a former political prisoner better known by his pen name, Po  Yang, is chairman of the Taiwanese AI branch, which has 124 members.
London-based AI was founded in 1961 with branches in 51 countries and  subcommittees in 70 countries.
