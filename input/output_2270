The North Korean president, whose comments were from an interview last  month with the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina and broadcast Friday, also  warned that "if the situation on the Korean peninsula worsens and a  contingency arises, it will be no good for Japan."
The agency did not elaborate on what "contingency" meant.
Kim also addressed the reunification issue, saying that joining the two  Koreas was a "supreme task of our people which must not be delayed," and  preferably achieved by the turn of the century.
"No force can keep our nation divided forever," he said, adding "grave  difficulties and obstacles lie in the way of our people's reunification owing  to the machinations of the South Korean authorities to oppose reunification  and provoke a new war."
