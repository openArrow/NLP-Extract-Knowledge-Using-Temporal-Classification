Capriati officially left the tour because of an elbow injury. In January  she said she would stay away until she completed her High School education.
Her father and coach, Stefano Capriati, said in March that she might  return for the French Open, but Capriati herself seemed unenthusiastic.
After the latest arrest, Capriati's agent Barbara Perry said on Wednesday  that the player was "in school in Boca Raton" and "back living with her family  in Florida."
It remains to be seen if Capriati will ever play top flight tennis again.
Macci said he was certain Capriati would return.
"I have no doubt she is going to play again. There is no doubt she can be  back at the top of the mountain, he said"
But in the latest issue of America's 'Tennis Magazine', Capriati's  ex-coach Tom Gullikson said: "I think she's got a lot of work to do if she is  ever to come back. And she has to want to do it for herself.
"The thing is, I honestly never got the sense that she really loved the  game, the way you sense tha a Pete Sampras or a Jimmy Connors really loves it."
McEnroe had no doubts.
"I don't think there is any question she is going to play tennis again.  What else is she going to do?"
