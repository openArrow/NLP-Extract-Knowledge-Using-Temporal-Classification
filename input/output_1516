The growing demand for bird's nest soup in Hong  Kong and other Asian countries is threatening the swiftlet bird population,  the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) said Wednesday.
The population of Asian swiftlets is being threatened due to a growing  demand for soup made from their nests, made from the birds' saliva and  considered a health tonic by Asians, WWF said.
"Clearly, the growing demand is having an impact on these birds and  stricter measures are needed to ensure their long-term survival," said Jorgen  Thomsen, director of Traffic International, WWF's wildlife trade monitoring  programme.
He said international trade in swiflet nests has tripled in the last  decade in Hong Kong, the world's largest market.  In 1991 about 17.5 million  edible nests were imported into the territory, mainly from Indonesia.
The volume of trade is accelerating in other Asian nations as well,  particularly Singapore and China, he said.
Exporters can earn up to 1,000 US dollars a kilo for the small cup-shaped  nests, which are built on to the rock face of cave walls and weigh only a  couple of grams each.
