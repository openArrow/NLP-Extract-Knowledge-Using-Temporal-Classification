It stretched for hundreds of meters (yards) alongside  a highway, and smelled fishy.
But hundreds of people took a bite out of the world's longest sandwich  Sunday -- after inspectors with an eye for record breaking events gave it the  green light for the Guinness Book.
Lima radio station Radioprogramas del Peru and the National Fisheries  Association organized the sardine sandwich event aimed at giving Peru a better  image abroad.
Participants used 10,000 rolls baked in the kitchens of the Peruvian navy  and cracked open 3,950 kilograms (8,700 pounds) of canned sardines to build  the sandwich that snaked 4,576 meters (yards) along a highway between downtown  Lima and the capital's south end.
After inspectors gave it the thumbs-up, the record breaker turned into  lunch for the crowd.
