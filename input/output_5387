The fate of Europe rested on a few kilometres of  beach and a few sleepy villages in the northern French region of Normandy when  the Allies landed on June 6, 1944 for the biggest seaborne invasion of all  time.
On that momentous and long-awaited day, the beaches along the Nacre  coastline were given new names: "Utah" and "Omaha" for the American  beachheads, "Gold," "Sword" and "Juno" for the British and Canadian landings.
It started at 10:00 p.m. London time on June 5 -- 9:00 p.m. in France --  when parachutists with blackened faces boarded their aircraft under the  watchful eyes of US General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who demanded nothing less  than total victory.
The BBC broadcast two lines from the French poet Paul Verlaine that served  to alert the French resistance that D-Day was going ahead.
The moon was almost full, but the Allies decided to take advantage in a  lull in the storm that had raged for several days, a calm that the German  meteorological service had not forecast.
At five past midnight the shelling started, a barrage of more than 5,000  tons of bombs along the coast from Le Havre to Cherbourg right up until dawn,  silencing many of the German batteries.
Five minutes later hundreds of flares were dropped by parachute to mark  out the landing sites.
At a quarter past midnight more than 1,000 gliders with men and equipment  landed on the fields and on the marshlands the Germans had flooded.
A few minutes after they landed, piper Bill Millin was playing "Blue  Bonnets Ove the Border" on the Benouville swing bridge over the Caen canal,  the first victory of D-Day.
Flown in aboard Horsa gliders, nicknamed "Flying Coffins," Major John  Howard and several dozen men took the bridge, which will go down in history  under its codename Pegasus Bridge, after the winged horse emblem of the  British 6th division.
At the entrance to the bridge, the Gondree family's cafe became the first  house in France to be liberated from the Nazis.
