James Earl Ray was denied parole  Wednesday in his first hearing since he was jailed for assassinating Martin  Luther King Jr. in 1968.
A panel of three judges dismissed Ray's claim that he was not the one who  shot the civil rights leader at a Memphis hotel, but said they might favor his  release in 1999 when his next parole hearing is due.
Ray, who pleaded guilty to the killing but then recanted three days later,  said he had been persuaded by his lawyer that he had already been convicted by  the media and that pleading guilty in return for 99 years was better than  risking a trial and a possible death sentence.
"First, I didn't kill Dr. King. I wasn't involved in any type of collusive  activity," he said.
A congressional committee found in 1978 that the killing had been a  conspiracy by white supremists who hired Ray, who had a long criminal record,  as the triggerman.
