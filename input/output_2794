Determined to make up time on  lead yacht Yamaha, Europe's Intrum Justicia took an early lead at the start of  the final-leg of the Whitbread 'Round the World' Race here Saturday.
Intrum Justicia, skippered by Lawrie Smith, was the first of 14 boats to  round the four-mile mark of the 3,818-mile leg to Southampton, England, and  quickly built a six-minute advantage over Yamaha, which enjoyed a  10-and-a-half hour lead after five legs in the Whitbread 60 class.
Yamaha, a joint New Zeland-Japanese entry skippered by Ross Field, made  the turn into the Atlantic Ocean second, followed by Merit Cup, trying to  close an 18-hour gap with New Zealand Endeavor in the Maxi class.
Tokio, which led after four legs but broke a mast off the coast of Brazil  in the fifth leg, rounded the mark in fourth place.
Tokio led briefly at the start as a result of a brilliant tacking maneuver  by skipper Chris Dickson, but was slow in moving out into the off-shore  current.
The yachts battled 8-10 knot northwesterly winds as they sailed north  along the Florida coastline, slowing their pace and putting a premium on  maneuvers.
An estimated 1,500 to 2,000 spectator boats also hampered the fleet's  progress.
New Zealand Endeavor got the worst of the conditions.  Skipper Grant  Dalton was forced to make two separate maneuvers and missed the four-mile mark  the first time and had to go around again, dropping his lead Maxi into 11th  place for the final leg.
Speaking from onboard, Dalton admitted he had a "dreadful" start.
Heineken, the all-female U.S. boat, crossed the start line three seconds  early and was assessed a 13-minute penalty.
The green-and-white Whitbread 60 was the fifth boat to round the mark,  followed by the renamed British entry Reebok (formerly the Dolphin and Youth),  Galicia 93 Pescanova, Winston, and French Maxi La Poste.
