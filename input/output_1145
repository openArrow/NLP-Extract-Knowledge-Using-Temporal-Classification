A part-time actor who snipped off his pubic hair  in public to protest press coverage of Singapore's gay community was fined  1,000 Singapore dollars (645 dollars) Tuesday for obscenity.
Josef Ng Sing Chor sparked off calls for tighter supervision over the  performance arts when he turned his back on a 100-strong shopping mall crowd,  dropped his briefs and cut his pubic hair early this year.
The 22-year-old navy sergeant, who also pressed a lit cigarette against  his upper arm during the performance, Monday pleaded guilty to commiting an  obscene act in public.
"I was making a statement," he told AFP after appearing before District  Judge Chym Lye Beng.
Ng's New Year eve performance was promptly condemned by the Ministry of  Home Affairs and the National Arts Council which called the act "vulgar and  completely distasteful."
"Artists with talent do not have to resort to antics in order to draw  attention to themselves or to communicate their feelings or ideas," the  council said.
The council and police also barred Ng and another performer, Shannon Tham,  who forced himself to vomit before the same audience from performing in public  again.
After the incident, the council said it would not provide financial  support for the "performance arts" which encourage spontaneous audience  participation, saying that such forums could be used to agitate audiences.
