A 191-yard hole in one kept South  African Ernie Els in the lead after the second round of the PGA championship  here on Saturday.
The second ace of his career came at the fifth hole and helped fend off a  double Spanish challenge.
Els, 12 under par, leads by two strokes from Miguel Angel Jimenez and  three from US Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal.
Spain's incomparable Seve Ballesteros, seven times a winner at Wentworth,  also fired a 66, including nine birdies, to revive his hopes of more glory.
Ballesteros was in danger of missing the half-way cut for the third  successive time in the championship, when he resumed at one over par.
But he chipped in twice and had a mere 24 putts to climb to a five under  par total of 139.
Scotland's Adam Hunter had the round of the day, though, packing an eagle  and seven birdies into a 65, which left the 30-year-old Glaswegian on eight  under.
Chief casualty of the half-way axe was Ian Woosnam, who bowed out early  for the first time in Europe since the 1992 Benson and Hedges International 30  events ago. The Welshman added a 75 to his opening 73.
Nick Faldo still has a lot of catching up to do, even with three birdies  in his last five holes.
It gave the world number two, four times a winner of the title, a 70 and  aggregate of 142, two under.
Jimenez, whose only tour victory came in the 1992 Belgian Open, raced to  the turn in 31 and, when he had a hat-trick of birdies from the 11th, the  course record of 63 held by Australian Wayne Riley was under threat.
The 30-year-old former caddie from Malaga lost that hope by three-putting  the 14th and 16th, but made a 35-footer on the next.
Defending champion Bernhard Langer is alongside Ballesteros on five over,  as are Scotland's Paul Lawrie and Yorkshireman Gordon J Brand.
