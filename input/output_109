Taiwan is to cut tariffs on 758 items, about  one-third of them agricultural products, by an average of 2.81 percent to  promote free trade and boost its chance of being admitted to the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT,) financial officials said Friday.
The cabinet Thursday approved a revised tariff schedule reducing import  duties on 514 industrial goods and 244 farm products as proposed by the  ministries of finance and economic affairs, the officials said.
The rates would become effective after endorsement by parliament, they  said.
Average tariffs on the affected industrial items would be lowered from  6.52 percent to 6.38 percent, while those on the agricultural goods would be  cut from 21.64 percent to 20.79 percent.
The liberalization move, aiming to stimulate domestic industries and buoy  Taiwan's position in consultation talks with GATT member countries over the  country's bid to join the world body, the officials said.
The tariff reductions would cost 94.3 million dollars in custom revenues,  they added.
Fruits, vegetables, juice, beef and marine products were among the  affected agricultural imports while general consumer goods such as cosmetics  and home electrical appliances would also enjoy lower rates, they said.
