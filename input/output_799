"I totally lost the front end," Andretti said. "I was chasing it. I was  looking all over the race track trying to get the grip. We just didn't have  the setup for these conditions."
Unser won his first 100,000-dollar Indy pole and will make his first  front-row Indy start 24 years after his father won from his only Indy pole.
"There are two races at Indy," Unser said. "Winning pole is nice, but  we're here to win the race."
Between the top Mercedes racers is Boesel, making his eighth Indy start  and second straight from the front row. He began on the outside and finished  fourth last year. His Cosworth-powered Lola is the fastest non-Mercedes car.
"Raul has established himself as a great driver," Fittipaldi said. "He  will run very strong in the race.
Tracy, also powered by Mercedes, was approved to drive Sunday after  suffering a concussion in a practice crash Friday. He struggled to qualify in  the 10th row, a disappointing fate for a driver who had been a pole contender  before his crash.
Tracy and Villeneuve were not the only Canadians to suffer a bad day.  Scott Goodyear crashed at the entrance to pit row during a practice lap,  scattering debris from his wrecked car. He was checked at Methodist Hospital  and released with no injuries.
Johansson had problems much of the weekend but qualified safely.
"We struggled a little for the past few days but we're up to reasonable  speed now," Johansson said.
Three vacancies remain in the 33-car field entering next weekend's final  time trials. Should more cars qualify, the slowest are bumped from the lineup  and drivers must try to return in another car.
The slowest qualified driver, or "man on the bubble," is Mike Groff in a  Honda-powered Lola. Another Honda driver, Bobby Rahal, is next on the bump  list.
