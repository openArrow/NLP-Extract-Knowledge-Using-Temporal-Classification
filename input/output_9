French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said  Thursday that a US Senate vote calling for a unilateral lifting of the arms  embargo on Bosnia was a matter of internal politics in the United States.
"I got the impression that this is a message for internal use because the  two amendments adopted are contradictory," Juppe said after senators approved  two separate measures calling for a multilateral lifting of the embargo and  unilateral action by Washington.
"I was able to pick up from my discussions that the House of  Representatives had no intention of approving a compulsory measure," he added.
Juppe said that his discussions with President Bill Clinton and Secretary  of State Warren Christopher reinforced the idea that Washington was not moving  toward a unilateral lifting of the embargo to help the Moslem-led Bosnian  government defend itself.
