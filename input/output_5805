Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin hardened his stance  on Tuesday saying he would not allowed PLO chairman Yasser Arafat to visit  Jerusalem in the next two years, state radio reported.
With both Israel and the Palestinians both increasingly pushing their  claims to Jerusalem, Rabin scotched any hopes of an early trip to the holy  city for the PLO leader.
"For the moment, I can't see any reason for him to come to Jerusalem,"  state radio quoted Rabin as telling a closed door meeting of parliament's  defence and foreign affairs committee.
"But after two years I don't know what my position might be," the premier  added.
After two years of autonomy Israel and the PLO are scheduled to begin  negotiations on a permanent settlement, which is to include the question of  Jerusalem.
Israel captured the eastern sector of the city from Jordan in the 1967  Middle East war and declared Jerusalem its united and eternal capital in 1980.
However the Palestinians also demand a share of Jerusalem for their  capital.
Rabin added that Arafat had still not officially told Israel when he  intended to visit the autonomous enclave of Jericho.
However Israeli and Palestinian officials have said Arafat is expected to  reach the West Bank oasis in mid-June.
