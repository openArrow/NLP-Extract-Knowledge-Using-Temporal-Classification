Police said here Wednesday they were looking into  the business affairs of a bank vice-president who committed suicide amid  allegations of possible financial improprieties.
Senior Police Officer Albert Fernandez told AFP they would focus on the  affairs of Reynaldo Feliciano, a vice-president of the Bank of Commerce, who  shot himself in his home on Tuesday.
Fernandez said police were looking into his job, particularly any relation  with Bancapital Development Corp., a trader of government securities which  closed down amid suspicions they had failed to deliver payments to large banks.
