A jilted lover was sentenced here Wednesday to  10 years in prison and psychiatric observation for injecting his former  girlfriend with HIV-infected blood.
Iwan Elias, a 39-year-old Dutch national born in Suriname, was found  guilty of stabbing his former lover, a mother of two, with a syringe  containing blood he had obtained shortly before from a simple-minded friend  suffering from Acquired Immune-deficiency Syndrome.
"You will get AIDS and will never again have sex," he reportedly told the  woman after stabbing her.
The woman has been diagnosed as HIV-positive.
