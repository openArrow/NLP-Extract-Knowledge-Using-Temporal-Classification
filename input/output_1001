Between 500 and 600 British companies have opened  an account with Eurotunnel to transport freight through the Channel tunnel, a  spokesman for the British Freight Transport Association (FTA) said on Monday.
But this did not mean that they would use the tunnel because many  companies were now being offered reductions of fares for crossing by ferry, he  said.
"Whether they will use the tunnel or not, we don't know yet," spokesman  John Guttridge said. "They will be looking at the costs, and also at the  services they get."
Earlier in the day, Eurotunnel announced that it would begin commercial  operations this week. The first trip by a freight shuttle charging fares would  be made by Thursday.
Gutteridge said that it would take "at least six months" to judge the  success of the tunnel in attracting freight transport, as the service would  initially be "largely experimenting."
Drivers of heavy-goods vehicles would be particularly tempted to use the  Channel tunnel once it was finished because of the increased risk of bad  weather in the Channel in winter, he said.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said in a statement  that Rover would be the first car manufacturer in Britain to export completed  vehicles through the tunnel.
Rover hopes to reduce the delivery time of new cars to Italy, for example.
