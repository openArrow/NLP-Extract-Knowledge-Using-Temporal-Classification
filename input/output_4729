Police launched an investigation Friday into  charges of false accounting against the head of a firm partly-controlled by  Fininvest, the media group of premier Silvio Berlusconi, judicial sources said.
Urbano Cairo, a senior official with Mondadori Pubblicita, was questioned  in connection with invoices sent by advertising agency Publivis 85, to another  Fininvest company, Publitalia 80, the sources said.
Cairo's firm has already been investigated in the context of an inquiry  underway since March into suspected corruption in the Fininvest multi-media  group, including Publitalia in particular.
Berlusconi renounced his executive role in Fininvest when he launched his  political career in January by founding the Forza Italia party, which  eventually led the winning coalition in general elections. He remains the  owner of the group.
In April Fininvest said it was selling most of its stake in Mondadori,  reducing its holding from 98 percent to 47 percent, in the first major pullout  since January.
