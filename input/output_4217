German Cooperation and Development Minister  Carl-Dieter Spranger arrived in Hanoi Thursday for four days of talks with  Vietnamese officials on aid and the return of workers from the former East  Germany.
Spranger, who is due to meet senior economic and labour officials during  his visit, is expected to bring up the thorny issue of Vietnamese guest  workers who were employed in East Germany and have stayed on after  reunification.
The two sides are expected to begin formal talks on the repatriation of  the workers in June. A spokesman for Spranger's ministry said before the visit  that they were expecting the talks to be "difficult" as Vietnam was refusing  to take back its citizens.
Spranger is to assess the effectiveness of German aid to Vietnam, which  amounted to 160 million marks (97.5 million US dollars) between 1990 and 1993  as Bonn took over projects formerly run by East Germans.
Hanoi is suspected of demanding compensation for taking back some 45,000  Vietnamese in Germany under a proposed agreement between the two governments.
At least 9,000 Vietnamese have no residency permits, 11,000 are on  temporary visas and around 25,000 have applied for political asylum but have  little hope in seeing it granted, according to German officials.
Thousands of Vietnamese were brought in under agreements between East  Berlin and Hanoi to work in menial jobs while most of their salaries were  directly paid to the Vietnamese government.
The economic crisis in the east after reunification saw most lose their  jobs, although between 10,000 and 15,000 are still employed, according to  officials in Berlin.
No Vietnamese are likely to be expelled until there is an agreement with  Hanoi, which wants Germany to provide money for retraining and education for  returnees, who are facing bleak employment prospects here.
