Financial ministers, bankers and advisors of  developing Asian nations began a search Thursday for the elusive causes of  success in East and Southeast Asian economies.
More than 50 people began examining case studies of East Asian "Tiger"  economies -- and their younger "cubs" in Southeast Asia region -- during a  two-day conference organized by the World Bank and the UN Economic and Social  Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).
Divining the elements of East Asian business success has been a successful  business in itself, with experts often disagreeing, admits Callisto Madavo,  the World Bank's East Asia and Pacific director.
"There's no point in citing a single 'magic bullet' because I don't think  there is one," he said.
But ESCAP and the World Bank hope "policy-makers will have some new ideas  to consider when they go home," said ESCAP executive secretary Rafeeuddin  Ahmed.
The promise of leaning something valuable has drawn emisaries from the  high-powered, like Hong Kong, to those with high potential, like China, to the  subdued and isolated like Burma.
Delegates from nearly 20 countries sifted through World Bank studies that  highlighted three qualities shared by East Asian economies. Eight of these  economies have been the among the 12 fastest growing in the world since 1960.
The three qualities they shared are:
-- Stable and enforced macroeconomic policies that were "conducive to  investment and enterprise."
-- Powerful incentives to encourage efficient use of resources, rather  than mad-grab consumption.
-- "A dynamic engine of growth to provide leadership for development."
The last point is flexibly defined, what Ahmed calls an "intangible."
But a World Bank advisory suggests undeveloped economies can fuel an  "engine of growth" by following certain guidelines, including spreading growth  and income, investing in education, and finding a national consensus on  economic goals.
