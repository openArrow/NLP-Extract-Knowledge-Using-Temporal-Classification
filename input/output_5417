The UN-controlled Tuzla airport  came under heavy shelling Monday, forcing UN troops into protective shelters,  a UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) officer said.
"We're being shelled, we're on red alert and everyone is in the shelters,"  the duty officer at the airport, some 20 kilometres (12 miles) south-east of  the town of Tuzla, told AFP by telephone.
The attack began a litle before 2:00 p.m. (1230 GMT), the scheduled time  of arrival for one of two daily UNPROFOR flights into the airport, which  serves the northern Bosnian town.
It was not immediately clear whether the shelling had caused any  casualties.
Although UNPROFOR did not say which side was responsible for the attack, a  military source told AFP: "The Serbs said Monday morning that they could not  guarantee safety at the airport today.
"We don't know why they're in a bad mood," added the source, who asked not  to be named. "We're just glad they gave us advanced warning."
The airport was last shelled on May 17, when a number of shells were fired  from Serb positions 20 kilometres (12 miles) away as the first UNPROFOR flight  in a month was landing.
Although no casualties were suffered in the incident the seven shells  caused significant damage, particularly to the quarters of French fire  fighters stationed at the airport.
