Rwandan ambassador to Belgium Francois  Garupiyintwali on Sunday denied reports from Rwanda that the interim  government had fled its base in Gitarama, south of the capital Kigali.
Garupiyintwali told AFP by phone: "The entire Rwandan government is still  at work in Gitarama. I myself spoke to government officials in Gitarama early  Sunday evening."
The United Nations Mission to Rwanda said Sunday that several ministers  had left Gitarama for safer territory at Kibuye in the west and Butare in the  far south in the face of an onslaught by the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front  (RPF).
The UN spokesman said some of the ministers were staying on in Gitarama.  The interim government was formed the day after President Juvenal Habyarimana  was killed in a suspected RPF rocket attack on his plane on April 6.
The assassination plunged Rwanda into a civil war pitting Habyarimana's  majority Hutu group against the minority Tutsis and also against dissident  Hutus, unleashing a tidal wave of reprisals that have left as many as half a  million people dead.
