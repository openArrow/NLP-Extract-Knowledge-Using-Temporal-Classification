Legendary cyclist Sir Hubert  Opperman, better known as Oppy, has pedalled his last kilometer on the open  road.
The 90-year-old, who set cycling fans alight in Europe in the 1920s and  1930s, delivered his Malvern Star bike -- built 50 years ago -- to a museum  celebrating his career here Sunday.
He was supposed to pedal it straight into the museum but Oppy turned right  instead of left and went for a one kilometre ride through this small town in  central Victoria state where he was born.
Two of the Australian's greatest wins were the 1928 Bol d'Or, a 24-hour  race in the southern Paris suburb of Montrouge and, three years later with  French fans yelling "Allez Oppy", the Paris-Best-Paris marathon over 1,168  kilometers (724 miles), then the world's major cycling event.
To win at Montrouge he set a record of 910 kilometers (564 miles) for the  24-hour test and his Bol d'Or achievement was marked by a bronze statue of  Oppy on his bike unveiled here Sunday.
The cycling star, who went on to a knighthood, a government ministry and a  diplomatic career, had promised his wife he would give up riding on the road  when he turned 90. "My muscles no longer respond quickly enough to the brain's  message. From now on I will ride a stationary exercise bike. I won't need a  helmet," he said.
