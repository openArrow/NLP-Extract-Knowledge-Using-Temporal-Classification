Russia and Estonia have agreed to revive stalled  negotiations on the complete withdrawal of Moscow's troops from the Baltic  republic by the end of August, both countries said Tuesday.
Estonian President Lennart Meri and Russian Foreign Minister Andrei  Kozyrev told journalists after two hours of "friendly and useful" talks that  they were both in favour of a rapid withdrawal of the 2,500 Russian troops  still stationed on Estonian soil.
"There is still time to withdraw the troops by the scheduled final date"  of August 31, Kozyrev predicted.
Estonia is the only Baltic state still to secure an accord with Moscow on  troop withdrawals.
The two men, who met on the sidelines of a conference of foreign ministers  from the 10 members of the Baltic Council, added that the countries' vice  foreign ministers would meet at an as yet unspecified time to pursue the  negotiations.
But Tuesday's talks did not secure agreement on the fate of the 10,640  retired Russian army officers still resident in Estonia -- the key issue  stalling the bilateral negotiations.
Moscow has made its military withdrawal conditional upon Estonia providing  guarantees on the social welfare of the retirees.
Meri said Tuesday that 5,600 of the 10,640 were already catered for -- a  reference notably to the over-60s among the Russian contingent, who have been  granted rights of residence.
The Estonian leader hinted last week that most of the retired Russian  soldiers living in Estonia would be allowed to stay.
That comment, which Kozyrev welcomed Tuesday, provoked a storm of  criticism from Estonian politicians including Prime Minister Mart Laar, who  said he would refuse to modify existing legislation preventing most former Red  Army soldiers from obtaining residence rights.
The two-day conference, which got under way Tuesday afternoon, is expected  to appoint a regional human rights commissioner to look after the rights of  ethnic minorities in Baltic countries.
