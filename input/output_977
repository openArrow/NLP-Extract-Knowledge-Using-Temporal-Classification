A woman who says she is facing the  same fate as her twin sister who died a month ago of the "slimmer's disease",  anorexia nervosa, has left hospital against medical advice, doctors said  Monday.
Samantha Kendall, 27, had been scheduled to leave for Canada last Saturday  for a new anorexic treatment at a Vancouver, British Columbia, clinic after  unsuccessful treatment in Britain.
But a medical exam demanded by British Airways to certify her fit to fly  turned up a chest infection Friday and she was hospitalized last week.
Doctors at Solihull Hospital said they were disappointed she had  discharged herself after three days against their advice.
"She was fully conscious and fully aware of what she was doing," said a  spokesman. "Obviously we would have wanted her to stay longer - she had been  showing signs of a slight improvement."
Samantha weighs less than 32 kilograms (70 pounds) and says she is  starving to death, but cannot bring herself to eat as a result of the anorexia  developed when she and her twin Michaela made a "slimming pact" when they were  chubby schoolgirls 13 years ago.
A New York television show has offered to finance the trip and treatment  at the Canadian clinic, which specializes in eating disorders.
