PLO guerrillas who joined the new  police force stormed out of their training camp on Monday demanding guns to  protect themselves, one of their leaders told AFP.
The walkout came after suspected Israeli agents in a car chased four of  the men from the Hawks, the armed wing of the mainstream PLO group Fatah.
"Out of 90 Hawks who began training four days ago, 70 have left," said  Rajah Abu Sita, one of the Hawk leaders.
"We are returning to the Hawks, to protect ourselves and defend ourselves  if attacked."
An AFP correspondent met several Hawks as they quit the camp in the former  Israeli base known as Ansar II on the Gaza City seafront.
Abu Sita and his cousin Amr killed a Jewish settler on the Gaza Strip in  March 1993 and were wanted by the Israelis before autonomy began at the start  of this month.
"We can't go on," Rajah said. "This is not a camp but a bazaar. There is  no security, neither inside nor outside the camp. We don't even have any  weapons.
"On Sunday when we went into town armed men in a Peugeot 504 chased us. We  were lucky to escape."
The two cousins sent a letter Sunday to Palestinian police chief General  Nasr Yussef to explain why they were leaving.
"There is no security in the camp," they wrote. "We are still hunted by  Israeli intelligence services even if there is an agreement between Israel and  the PLO.
"We want protection and weapons because we still feel we are in danger."
Rajah said: "Rabin has left certain elements here to kill us."
He also complained that the training camp was supposed to be solely for  former Hawks.
"We were surprised to find about 100 other recruits who did not belong to  our group, who were not wanted by the Israelis and who had never even carried  out any political activities.
"We want to be soldiers for our country and for Fatah," he added.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin also upset the new recruits with a hardline  statement Friday that Israel vetted all the new policemen.
"No Palestinian policemen from the territories has been recruited without  our agreement and we have never stopped checking that is the case."
Rabin said Israel had vetoed the names of several hundred Palestinians who  had been due to join the police from abroad.
He was reacting to Hebrew press reports that the Abu Sita cousins had  enlisted in the new force, which is about 4,000 strong and is due to swell to  9,000 men.
"What we say to Rabin is, 'You want to catch all those who are wanted  because they have killed settlers and collaborators. But who killed all our  martyrs? You have to answer that question,'" Rajah said.
