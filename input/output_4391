A gunman and an accomplice charged with  involvement in the February massacre of 16 worshippers in an Omdurman mosque  are to stand trial next month for murder, the Sudan News Agency (SUNA) said  Thursday.
Three gunmen opened fire in the attack in the Sudanese twin capital in  which 16 worshippers were killed and 20 others wounded.
One of the defendants at the trial, due to start June 11, is the only  surviving attacker, Mohamed Abdul Rahman al-Kkilaifi, a Libya-based Saudi.
He was arrested the day after the massacre in an exchange of gunfire with  security forces in which his two alleged accomplices were killed.
The other defendant was named as Mohamed al Mahi Mohamed Ahmed, who did  not take an active part in the attack.
When arrested in Ed Damazin, central Sudan a dew days later, he confessed  to being a member of the group which plotted the attack, officials said, but  changed his mind about participating in the massacre.
Khilaifi faces charges of premeditated murder, waging war against a Moslem  state, possession of unlicensed weapons and armed robbery.
Ahmed is charged with criminal complicity in addition to the charges filed  against his co-defendant, the agency said.
