China suffered a trade deficit of 1.75 billion  dollars in the first four months of the year, but the volume of exports grew  faster than that of imports, customs figures showed Tuesday.
The total volume of trade hit 57.84 billion dollars, up 21 percent on the  same period last year, with exports surging 22 percent to 28.04 billion  dollars and imports rising 20.3 percent to 29.79 billion dollars, the China  Daily quoted General Administration of Customs officials as saying.
The officials attributed the faster growth in exports to the positive  effects of macro-economic measures implemented since late last year to cool  the overheated economy, the report said.
The government is seeking to bring economic growth, which stood at 13  percent last year, under 10 percent this year.
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Minister Wu Yi reiterated recently  that China planned to balance its trade this year, after suffering a deficit  of 12.2 billion dollars in 1993, the first shortfall since 1989.
Wu blamed last year's deficit on booming domestic demand that drew  resources away from exports.
However, Chinese economists have expressed pessimism that the government  will achieve its target this year, saying exports are generally strongest in  the early months of the year.
The economists point to continued strong domestic demand and the rising  costs of exports after January's devaluation of the yuan as among the factors  that will make it difficult to clear the deficit this year.
