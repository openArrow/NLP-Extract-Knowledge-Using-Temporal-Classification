French film hearthrob Alain Delon, 58, has had an  operation for a hernia, his film producer friend Norbert Saada said Saturday.
Delon, whose screen career spans more than three decades, starred in films  including "Is Paris burning" in 1965, and more recently "Un Amour de Swann" in  1984.
He is due to leave hospital on Sunday. He was admitted Tuesday after  complaining of stomach pains.
