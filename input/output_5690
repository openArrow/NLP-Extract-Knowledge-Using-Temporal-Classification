The Croat Kresimir Zubak was elected Tuesday for  a six-month term as the first president of the new Croat-Moslem federation in  Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Zubak, a 46-year-old lawyer, was elected as the federation's constituent  parliament met for the second day in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo.
The man chosen as his vice president is a Moslem and Bosnia's current vice  president, Ejub Ganic. Both men were nominated by their respective communities  and elected unanimously.
Zubak is a native of Doboj, in northern Bosnia. Until war broke out two  years ago was the town's chief judge. An official statement said that since he  has worked for the "joint defense" of Moslems and Croats against Serb forces  controlling Doboj.
A moderate, like many of the Croats from northern Bosnia, he replaced the  extremist nationalist Mate Boban last January as head of the Bosnian Croat  community.
He has taken part in all negotiations in Washington and Vienna in the  build-up to formation of the new federation by the erstwhile allies against  the Serbs in Bosnia, who have fought their own bloody battles notably in the  Mostar region.
At Monday's opening session of the constituent parliament, Zubak and other  key figures reaffirmed the federation's claim for a 58 percent share of the  republic's territory.
Zubak told the assembly Monday that "possible compromises in the name of  peace must not in any way modify the basic principles and the stragetic  framework of the federation," particularly with regard to resources and  communications.
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic meanwhile said Monday he was not sure  he would travel to Geneva for talks Thursday with international negotiators  who are attempting to impose a settlement that would give the federation 51  percent of the territory, with 49 percent going to the republic's separatist  Serbs.
