Britain's Prince Charles, in  Russia Tuesday on the second day of a four-day visit, urged local business  leaders to "rebuild Russian society" and urged the west to help.
The British royal family, related by blood to the Romanov tsars, had  renounced all visits to Russia after the last tsar, Nicholas II, and his  family were gunned down by the Bolsheviks in 1918. But this embargo was broken  in 1973 by the prince's father, the Duke of Edinburgh.
The prince, who "for years, ... longed to come in Russia", explained that  he had decided to limit this trip to dealing with business links with Saint  Petersburg -- marking the first royal visit to the former imperial capital in  100 years.
The democratic development taking place in Russia at present offered great  opportunities and challenges to Russia and to the countries of western Europe,  Charles told his audience of business leaders.
"We (in western Europe) have an important responsability in helping you in  this task," he said.
But he warned that: "the free market will not on its own help to build a  society that is able to task with the problem of hunger, ill health, and  unsecurity."
The prince invited the members of his own Business Leaders Forum to "seize  the great opportunities" offered by Russia.
He set up the forum in 1990 to encourage private enterprise in the  recently formed market economies, particularly targetting eastern Europe.
The prince told Saint Petersburg Mayor Anatoly Sobchak that he hoped his  organisation would act as a catalyst in boosting the economy in Russia and  building economic links with Britain.
He praised "traditional relations between Russia and Great Britain" which  he hoped would return to their pre-revolutionary level.
