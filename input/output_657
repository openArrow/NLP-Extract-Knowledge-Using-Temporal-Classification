Khmer Rouge guerillas have  attacked and disabled a bridge on the outskirts of the key Cambodian town of  Sisophon, a Cambodian government officer said here.
About 50 Khmer Rouge guerrillas on Saturday blew up a section of a bridge  which connects Sisophon to the town of Mongkol Borey, eight kilometers (five  miles) east, he said.
The bridge on National Route 5, part of the government's supply route, had  been made impassable for large vehicles, according to officer with the  Cambodian-Thai Coordination Office (CTCO).
Government troops managed to drive off the guerrillas from the structure  and reinforcements had been sent, he said.
Mongkol Borey was believed to have been attacked by Khmer Rouge forces at  the same time, the officer said.
Detailed reports from the area were unavailable.
