Raw oysters could be lethal to those with  certain ailments, a consumer group warned Wednesday ahead of the holiday  weekend when tourist will be flocking to the beach and the popular "raw bars."
People with AIDS, alcoholism, cancer or other diseases which weaken the  immune system are vulnerable to the deadly the vibrio vulnificus bacteria  oysters can carry, according to Public Voice.
At least 13 people have died from eating contaminated oysters since 1992,  according to the group which has been lobbying to have the crustaceans labeled  with warnings.
"While raw shellfish can be a delicious appetizer, for the elderly, those  with liver disease, and those with immune system disorders such as AIDS, it  can also be a game of seafood roulette," said the group's director Mark  Epstein.
The contaminated oysters are from the Gulf Coast but they are shipped  around the country and infections have been reported in 14 states since 1981.
The Food and Drug Administration announced in January that it would  require the seafood industry to step up oversight on processing plants but  critics have charged that they have not kept that promise.
