Germany's opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP) is  expected to win the June 12 European elections here, according to an opinion  poll published Thursday in the daily Frankfurter Rundschau.
The poll, carried out by the INFAS institute, has the SDP leading by 39  percent in the elections against 35 percent for Chancelor Helmut Kohl's  Christian Democrat/Christian Socialist (CDU/CSU) alliance.
During the last elections held in 1989, the SDP and CDU/CSU were running  even, with the SDP garnering just over 37 percent of the vote and the  Christian Democrats 38 percent.
The Free Democrats, a small liberal party that is part of the coalition  government, may not be represented in the new European parliament as it is  expected to garner only five percent of the vote, the minimum required, the  poll results showed.
The Free Democrats won 5.6 percent of the vote in 1989.
The poll gave the Alliance '90/Greens party a total of 11 percent of the  vote, a two percent increase from the last elections, and the extreme-right  Republicans four percent, a 7.1 percent drop from 1989.
It also indicated that 65 percent of Germans living in the western part of  the country plan to vote June 12, compared to 55 percent for those living in  eastern Germany.
