Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov  called Friday for a resolution of the Greek-Macedonian conflict and said that  Greek sanctions against its neighbour could affect the region's stability.
"This situation is very regrettable because these sanctions are also  affecting Bulgaria," Daskalov said during a one-day official visit here. "This  conflict must be resolved on the negotiating table rather than through an  embargo."
Greece has refused landlocked Macedonia access to its northern port of  Salonika since mid-February in a dispute over names.
Athens accuses Skopje of having designs on the northern Greek province of  Macedonia and of usurping Greek symbols on its flag.
Daskalov on Friday also said that his country was paying a heavy price as  a result of the UN trade embargo against the rump-Yugoslavia -- Serbia and  Montenegro -- for the Serbs' role in the wars in Bosnia-Hercegovina and  Croatia.
