Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said  Tuesday that Israel had ways of making sure the PLO complied with the terms of  their self-rule accord.
"Every accord must serve the vital interests of both parties, which must  in turn rigorously respect their respective engagements," Rabin said at a  press conference at the Nahal Oz checkpoint between autonomous Gaza and Israel.
"There can be no unilateral violation. In case of serious violation by the  Palestinian side, Israel has the means to demand they put an end to it," he  warned, without elaborating.
The army's deputy chief of staff, General Amnon Shahak, told parliament's  defence and foreign affairs committee that the military had the means to make  sure autonomous Gaza and Jericho remained under control.
"The prime minister asked us to be prepared for any deterioration in the  situation in the autonomous territories, and the army has plans to face any  situation," he said.
Shahak said he could "say no more."
