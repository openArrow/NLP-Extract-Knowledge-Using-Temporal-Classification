Japan's biggest computer maker Fujitsu Ltd.  announced Thursday a group pre-tax profit of 44.1 billion yen (428 million  dollars) for the year to March, reversing a loss of 16.2 billion yen a year  earlier.
But the company also said its net consolidated losses widened 16 percent  to 37.7 billion yen in the same period, mainly due to the cost of  restructuring its troubled computer subsidiary Amdahl Corp. in the United  States.
Fujitsu, the world's second-biggest manufacturer of computers, said global  sales declined 9.3 percent from a year earlier to 3,139 billion yen, depressed  by sales of computers and information processing systems, especially overseas.
For the current year, pre-tax earnings are expected to double to 90  billion yen with sales recovering to around 3,220 billion yen. Fujitsu also  expects to return to the black on an after-tax basis with a net profit of 30  billion yen.
In the latest year, the company said, "technology advancement was  compounded by the rapid changes associated with the industry's shift toward  rightsizing open systems, networking and multimedia."
"There was a favourable turnaround in sales of communications systems,  especially in international markets, and sales of semiconductors and  electronic components enjoyed solid growth both in Japan and overseas.
"In computers and information-processing systems, however, Japan's  economic slump continued to adversely affect domestic sales and conditions in  the US mainframe market were especially poor," the company said.
Fujitsu said overseas sales plunged 19.5 percent from a year earlier to  926 billion yen, dropping from 33.2 percent of all turnover to 29.5 percent.
Sales of computers and information-processing systems dropped 15 percent  to 2,141 billion yen with overseas sales plunging 29 percent to 600 million  yen and domestic sales sliding seven percent to 1,541 billion yen.
But sales of communications systems grew three percent to 488 billion yen,  buoyed by a seven percent increase in overseas sales to 144 billion yen.  Doemstic sales rose less sharply, climbing two percent to 344 billion yen.
Revenue from semiconductors and electronic components was also higher,  climbing 12 percent to 395 billion yen. Domestic sales leapt 13 percent to 234  billion yen while overseas sales jumped 12 percent to 161 billion yen. Other  sales dropped 11.5 percent to 116 billion yen.
