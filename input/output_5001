Some 300,000 Ethiopians rallied here Saturday  to mark the third anniversary of the fall of dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam  and the accession of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front  (EPRDF).
The rallies, attended by diplomats, interim government members and  President Meles Zenawi, were held on the anniversary of the establishment of  the interim administration on May 28, 1991, a week after the fall of Mengistu.
Mengistu fled into exile in Zimbabwe as his civil war foes were poised to  take the capital Addis Ababa. He has remained there ever since. Ethiopia is  currently trying to organize his extradition under international law.
Defending his government's democratic credentials, Menes stressed that 72  percent of Ethiopian electors, or 16 million people, were registered to vote  for a constituent assembly on June 5.
He condemned the decision by opposition groups to boycott the ballot,  accusing them of "wasting their efforts in criticizing the government and  trying to hold back the process of democratization."
Next month's elections were originally scheduled to happen in January, but  were postponed in December.
Opposition parties in Ethiopia have been clamouring for a national  reconciliation conference to forge a new transitional administration to  replace the current one.
