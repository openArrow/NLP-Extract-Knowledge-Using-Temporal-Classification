Japan's Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said  Wednesday Japan needed to maintain low interest rates to support its weakened  economy, ruling out any possible of monetary policy changes in response to  overnight US rate hikes.
"A country's monetary policy must reflect its economic situation," Fujii  said.
The US Federal Reserve Board overnight Tuesday raised the interbank rate  half a percentage point from 3.75 percent to 4.25 percent and its discount  rate from three to 3.5 percent.
The Fed said the move was "designed to maintain the favorable trend in  inflation and thereby sustain the economic expansion."
