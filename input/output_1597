Laos has secured 28 million dollars in  international aid to fight the opium trade and reduce the flow of drugs from  highland areas, a report said Wednesday.
Vice Foreign Minister Soubanh Saritthirath, who also heads a anti-drug  committee, said the money would be spent encouraging highland residents to  settle in the plains where they could grow rice rather than opium poppies, the  official KPL news agency said.
At a meeting Monday with provincial officials, Soubanh said Laos had  agreed an overall scheme with the UN Drug Control Programme to control  production up to 2000.
Countries including the United States have contributed 28 million dollars  to help fight production in Laos, one of the countries in the notorious  "Golden Triangle" opium area.
The aim of the programme is to end slash-and-burn agriculture and poppy  production in the highlands and "introduce rural people to a more financially  and environmentally sound method of livelihood," the news agency said.
