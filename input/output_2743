Further US-Japan talks aimed at breaking a  three-month deadlock in trade negotiations have been delayed until Monday at  least said a US official here Saturday.
The talks had been expected to continue Saturday but late Saturday morning  the official said no meetings were planned for Saturday or Sunday and that  they would now resume most likely on Monday.
"This should not be interpreted that the talks had run into problems,"  added the official.
Late Friday President Bill Clinton's deputy economic advisor Bowman Cutter  said: "The conversations are going well."
The talks had originally been scheduled to last only one day, and the few  comments made by officials since Thursday morning have generally been hopeful.
