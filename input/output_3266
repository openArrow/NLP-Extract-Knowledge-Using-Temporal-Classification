World number-one Pete Sampras took a first step  towards his 'Grand Slam' dream here on Monday when he beat Spanish qualifier  Alberto Costa in straight-sets in the first-round of the French Open.
Sampras, winner of Wimbledon and the United States Open last year and of  the Australian Open in January, notched up a stylish 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 victory on  Roland Garros' new 10,000-capacity 'A' showcourt, and said: "I felt pretty  comfortable out there."
The 22-year-old American, who arrived in the French capital fresh from  five consecutive tournament victories, including an impressive triumph at the  gruelling Italian Open, now faces another qualifier -- Marcelo Rios of Chile.
Rios scored a 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 victory over fellow-qualifier Joshua Eagle orf  Australia.
Sampras, who has never got further than the quarter-finals in four  previous visits to the event and who went down to eventual champion Sergi  Bruguera of Spain last year, has clearly overcome his initial fear of the  slower surface.
"Providing I serve well I feel good," he said, adding: "It's the most  important part of my game."
Sampras is seeded to play compatriot and twice-champion Jim Couier in the  quarter-finals and Bruguera in the semi-finals.
