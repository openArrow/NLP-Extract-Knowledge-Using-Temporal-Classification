Peace talks between the Philippine government and  Moslem insurgents will go on even if a continuing rift with Indonesia results  in Jakarta cancelling its hosting of the talks, a government negotiator said  here Thursday.
Manuel Yan, an adviser of President Fidel Ramos on peace negotiations,  admitted that Jakarta, which is hosting the negotiations between Manila and  the insurgent Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), had not yet given word on  when the next round of talks would take place.
He said he did not know why the talks, which were originally scheduled to  resume on April, were postponed but said he had seen no indication that it was  related to Indonesia's displeasure over a conference on East Timor which is to  be held at the state university here starting May 31.
Indonesia has objected to the holding of the conference, organized by  local leftists, but President Fidel Ramos has said he cannot stop it.
The MNLF waged a bloody campaign for a separate Moslem state in the  southern Philippines in the 1970s but has since been weakened by internal  strife and declining overseas support. It has since agreed to a ceasefire with  Manila in order to negotiate for autonomy for Moslem-populated regions.
