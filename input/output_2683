Rwandan rebels pushed on Saturday with a violent
Abdul Kabia, contacted by telephone, said the rebels from the  Tutsi-dominaed Rwandan Patriotic Front held the advantage in the latest  fighting.
But he was reluctant to say if this "major offensive" was the final push  the rebels have vowed to make against the Hutu-dominated government forces to  take Kigali.
"We are uncertain exactly what their strategy is," said Kabia.
Though fighting died down somewhat during the morning, it forced the  United Nations to cancel a flight from Nairobi that was to try to get into  Kigali Saturday.
The fighting has kept the airport closed for three days running, blocking  UN attempts to fly in desperately needed food and medicine.
The airport is Kigali's only lifeline, but for the RPF it is a military  target because one of the army's biggest military camps, Camp Kanombe, runs  alongside the runways.
Kabia said shells fell on the airport's arrival terminal and near the  control tower Saturday. Though they caused no injuries among UNAMIR forces  deployed at the facility, six UN vehicles were destroyed.
Shells also fell inside the Rwandan capital, some near the Hotel Diplomate  and Kigali's hospital, where 30 patients were killed in their beds in shelling  on Thursday.
There were no immediate reports of new casualties on Saturday.
Special UN envoy Iqbal Riza of Pakistan was expected in Kigali this  weekend to seek the cooperation of both sides with the Security Council's  decision to send 5,500 peacekeepers to Rwanda.
Kabia said government forces had set up camp in "defensive positions" near  Gitarama, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of the capital, where the rebels  are thought to be preparing a vast offensive.
Gitarama is where the interim government opposed by the rebels holed up  after fleeing the capital when the country slipped back into civil war last  month, ending an eight-month-old truce that had brought UN troops into the  country to help prepare for elections.
The fighting erupted after the April 6 destruction of a plane carrying  President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu who had been seeking to open up  government to the minority Tutsis despite strong opposition from Hutu  extremists.
Up to half a million Rwandans have been butchered in ethnic and political  killings since then, with many of the victims members of the minority Tutsi  and Hutu opponents of the military-dominated government, hacked or bludgeoned  to death by extremist Hutu militias.
In Geneva, an International Committee of the Red Cross said Friday that  "hundreds of thousands" of people were fleeing central Rwanda amid the upsurge  of fighting in Kigali and elsewhere, many milling around the Gitarama region.
At least two million of the country's seven million population have been  made homeless and are threatened by epidemics, according to the World Health  Organisation.
