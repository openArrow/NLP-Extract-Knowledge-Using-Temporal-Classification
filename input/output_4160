Dynamic flanker Willie Ofahengaue is one of nine  Wallabies named here Thursday in an Australian rugby union XV to play touring  Ireland in Mt.Isa in northern Queensland next Wednesday.
Ofahengaue is recovering from knee surgery which sidelined him for the  bulk of last season and the selectors will use the Irish match to gauge his  fitness and form.
He joins fly-half David Knox, prop Dan Crowley, wingers Alistair Murdoch  and Ryan Constable, centre Pat Howard, scrumhalf Mark Catchpole, number eight  Fili Finau and flanker Brett Robinson.
The team is: Andrew Apps, Alistair Murdoch, Joe Roff, Pat Howard, Ryan  Constable, David Knox, Mark Catchpole, Dan Crowley (captain), Owen Finegan,  George Websdale, Justin Nowlan, Rob Korst, Willie Ofahengaue, Brett Robinson,  Fili Finau.
Meanwhile, former Wallaby fullback Glen Ella was named as the new  technical assistant coach with the Australian team on Thursday.
He comes in for Jake Howard and will link up with team coaches Bob Dwyer  and assistant coach Bob Templeton.
Ella, 34, brother to Mark and Gary, played four tests and toured Britain  and Ireland in 1981-82 and New Zealand in 1982 and 1986.
