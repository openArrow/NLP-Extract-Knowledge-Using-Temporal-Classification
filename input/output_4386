Fittipaldi and Unser, teammates for Penske Racing, share the Indy-car  season points lead with 37 through three events in the 16-race schedule.
Fittipaldi, 47, emphasizes his physical fitness, eating a special diet and  even having his recipes in the local newspapers. His pasta and fish dishes  have kept him in racing shape.
"It's more important to stay fit as you grow older," said Fittipaldi. "I  follow a high-energy diet the week before the race and I will load up on  carbohydrates the day before. I spend the night before every race relaxing  with my family and getting a good rest."
Fittipaldi, a father of five, owns an orange plantation in Brazil, where  he also operates a clothing business and a custom car wheel firm. It's a far  cry from the youth who won Brazil's Formula Vee title in 1967 and then took  his life's savings to Britain to start racing in the Formula Ford series.
Fittipaldi moved to Formula 300 and in 1969 joined Formula One's Team  Lotus. He won F1 world titles in 1972 and 1974.
"Winning my first F1 title was incredible because at 25 I was the youngest  F1 champion," Fittipaldi said. "And I have also gotten to win at Indy, which  was my dream since I was a boy."
Fittipaldi retired from Formula One in 1982 but was lured back two years  later to drive on the Indy-car circuit. Since 1985, Fittipaldi has won at  least one race a season. He took three last year and finished second to Nigel  Mansell for the series title.
Retirement is not on Fittipaldi's mind, although his has some concern with  this year's farewell season of Mario Andretti.
"Now I might be the oldest driver out here," he said. "No, I have not  thought about when I'm going to stop. I'm enjoying it too much."
Fittipaldi is enjoyed by his peers as well. An Indy drivers' poll showed  Fittipaldi was the Indy-car racer respected most by his peers.
Only one driver scored better overall in the survey -- Senna.
