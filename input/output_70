Two Nigerian soldiers were killed in the disputed  Bakassi peninsula in an incident blamed on Cameroon, Nigerian television  reported Thursday.
"Cameroon has once again confirmed that she is the aggressor," armed  forces spokesman Colonel Okon Ede was quoted as saying.
"While Nigeria has been playing the role of a good neighbour by resorting  to diplomatic, political and traditional means to resolve the dispute,  Cameroon has consistently displayed arrogant agression which resulted in the  death of two Nigerian soldiers recently."
Ede's statement, which gave no further details of the incident, called on  the international community to take note of "another veritable act of  provocation" by Cameroon.
Earlier the official Nigerian news agency said head of state General Sani  Abacha had held "crucial consultations" on national security with his armed  forces chiefs Thursday in the capital Abuja.
The situation in Bakassi, an area rich in natural resources where the two  sides have confronted each other since January, was one the agenda as well as  political and economic conditions in Nigeria, the agency said.
