Japan's Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. announced  Friday a pre-tax loss of 33 billion yen (321 million dollars) for the year to  March, reversing a profit of 5.3 billion yen a year earlier.
The company, which like most Japanese steeelmakers suspended its year-end  dividend, said sales fell 5.9 percent to 1,043 billion yen in the same period.
"Sumitomo Metals foresees the recession continuing in the year ahead," the  leading steelmaker said without issuing a forecast. "Private-sector capital  investment will remain depressed due to disppointing corporate profits.
"In the steel industry as well, the operating environment will become more  severe due to the continuing recession in Japan, declining demand for steel in  exporting industries and decreased exports to China," the company said.
Sumitomo said its production of pig iron grew from 10.87 million tonnes a  year earlier to 10.94 million tonnes in the latest year. But crude steel  output dropped from 10.01 million tonnes to 9.99 million tonnes and output of  finished products declined from 9.48 million tonnes to 9.41 million tonnes.
