French philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy said Bosnian  President Alija Izetbegovic was due in Paris Sunday evening.
The president, here at Levy's invitation, will meet Monday with Levy and  with the leaders of the Socialist and ruling coalition lists for the European  Parliament elections in June, Michel Rocard and Dominique Baudis respectively,  the philosopher said.
Izetbegovic was due to arrive from Saudi Arabia where he made a pilgrimage  to the holy city of Mecca.
Levy is fielding what he calls a "Sarajevo" list in the elections to  ensure that the Bosnian conflict remains on the agenda for the European Union.
Participants at a meeting Thursday decided to set up a list to be led by  cancer specialist Leon Schwartzenberg, and to be entitled "Europe begins in  Sarajevo."
Levy, an active supporter of the Moslems in the Bosnian conflict, has also  presented a documentary film on Bosnia-Hercegovina entitled "Bosna" at the  Cannes film festival.
He told French television earlier this month that it was "unthinkable that  the Bosnian issue is not at the heart of the European debate."
Rocard attended a public meeting Tuesday to discuss Levy's initiative,  which could draw votes from traditional Socialist voters.
