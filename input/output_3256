President Bill Clinton's top trade officials  reiterated Monday that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  should be ratified this year.
"We're going to pass GATT but it's not going to be easy," warned Treasury  Secretary Lloyd Bentsen during ceremonies to mark World Trade Week decreed by  Clinton for May 22 to 28.
Bentsen acknowledged, however, that GATT's approval was "not a given" and  that the federal budget had to make up 14 billion dollars in lost customs  receipts over five years.
"In the politically charged atmosphere of this election year congressional  approval can still be blocked by a small group of people who are frightened of  the future," said Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, who called on business leaders  to help convince legislators to approve the Uruguay Round of GATT signed by  more than 100 nations in Marrakesh last month.
Like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) ratified last year,  Brown added, "supporters are not speaking loud enough."
"Failure to (pass the GATT) would be an embarrassment and a severe  economic body blow," the commerce secretary said.
Brown also noted that the Clinton administration had worked to find  foreign markets for US businesses. "Sometimes successful commercial policy  demands that government become more active as an advocate, as a facilitator  and sometimes even as a financier," he said.
He noted that export controls on some products with military applications  had been eased with the end of the Cold War, and stressed the active role that  the Clinton administration had played in obtaining an estimated 10 billion  dollars worth of contracts for ATT, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas in Saudi  Arabia.
He also identified 10 main emerging markets that the Commerce Department  had chosen as targets: Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico,  Poland, South Africa, South Korea and Turkey.
