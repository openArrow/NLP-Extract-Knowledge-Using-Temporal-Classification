Southern leaders put forward a seven-point  plan Friday to end nine days of civil war in Yemen between rival north and  south forces, an official source said here.
The plan proposed by the southern Yemen Socialist Party, which is headed  by ousted vice-president Ali Salem al-Baid, calls for an "immediate end to the  war" and the creation of a government of national unity.
The government would be charged with "wiping out the consequences of the  war" and conducting an inquiry into "those responsible for the war," the  source said.
Baid, who was sacked last week as vice-president by the northern-dominated  parliament in the capital Sanaa, has said a ceasefire would depend on the  withdrawal of northern forces from the south.
His northern rival, President Ali Abdallah Saleh, has said he would only  accept a ceasefire if the southerners agreed to accept his government, respect  the country's unity and put all armed forces under the government's control.
The rival armies of former North and South Yemen have been locked in civil  war since May 5, shattering four years of uneasy union between the  conservative north and the Marxist south.
