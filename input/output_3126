US-based Dow Chemical Co. Inc. said on Monday  it had signed the basis of an agreement to establish a joint-venture to be  based in Hong Kong with Japanese Asahi Chemical Industry Co. Ltd.
The 50-50 joint venture between the two chemical giants would engage in  the marketing, sales and service of polystyrene primarily in China, Hong Kong,  Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore.
Under the agreement, which is subject to approval by the boards of both  companies, Asahi and Dow would develop a common polystyrene grade line-up  under the Styron trademark.
In Tokyo, a spokesman for Asahi Chemical said that annual sales of the  polystyrene venture were intended to reach 100 billion yen (97 million  dollars).
The new company was expected to be set up by July with operations starting  in August, the spokesman said, adding that the joint venture would establish  its own offices in China, Indonesia and Thailand.
Asahi, the biggest polystyrene manufacturer in Japan with annual output of  330,000 tonnes, exported 30,000 tonnes of polystyrene to Asia last year. The  company already has several subsidiaries and affiliates in South Korea,  Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia.
