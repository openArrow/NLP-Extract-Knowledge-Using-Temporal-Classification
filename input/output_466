Japanese organisers started a race against time on Saturday to find a  replacement for Argentina in the Kirin Cup.
"We are negotiating with countries which have friendly ties with the  Japanese Football Association," an association spokesman said.
Officials have until Monday night to find a replacement because of the  time needed to obtain entry visas, he said.
