Syria is willing to discuss an Israeli offer to  leave the Golan Heights on condition it pledges a complete withdrawal within a  "reasonable" time, the government newspaper Tishrin said on Sunday.
The remarks came as US Secretary of State Warren Christopher was expected  here later in his second peace shuttle to Syria and Israel in a month to forge  a peace deal between the arch enemies.
On his last trip two weeks ago he delivered to Syrian President Hafez  al-Assad proposals from Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin for a phased  withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which Israel conquered in 1967.
Rabin has offered to return three of five Druze villages on the heights as  a first stage in a three-step withdrawal over five-eight years. But details of  the peace plan have been kept secret.
Syria turned down the offer and sent a list of questions to the Israeli  authorities with Christopher demanding clarifications.
Diplomats said the exchange of messages between the arch-enemies was a  good sign of their intentions to try to narrow differences between them.
"The (Syrian) list included some very specific questions which opened the  way for a concrete and serious debate," a Western diplomat in Damascus said.
Meanwhile a senior Israeli official said in Jerusalem that Christopher  would try to persuade Syria to set up a joint military commission with Israel  in a fresh bid to unblock their peace talks.
"This trip will aim mainly to establish a military commission between the  two countries," he said Sunday.
"The commission would draft security arrangements for the border region  and report back to the politicians."
A similar commission was set up by Egypt and Israel and helped to bring  the old enemies together in a peace agreement, the official noted.
Syria's official press also called on the United States to honour a pledge  to play a full partner role in the peace process, saying it was not enough for  Christopher to be a mere postman between them.
"Damascus will not negotiate any Israeli proposals which do not stipulate  a clear engagement for a complete withdrawal in a reasonable time," Tishrin  newspaper said in a front-page editorial.
The commentary, entitled "Will Israel take the adequate decision," went on  to say that the ball lay in the Israeli court "and those who give it support"  referring to the United States.
The English-language Syria Times said progress depended on "Washington  playing its full partner role."
"This role should be effective and not ink on paper," the daily said.
Syrian demand for an Israeli pledge to withdraw totally from the Golan  Heights, which the Jewish state annexed in 1981, has been a major stumbling  block in the peace process.
Christopher, who is in Geneva for talks on the former Yugoslavia, said he  expected the process of reconciling Israel and Syria to be "long."
On Monday he flies to Israel and has not ruled out a return visit to  Damascus before leaving the region on Thursday.
"I do think the parties are serious and I want to play my part and take  messages back and forth," Christopher said.
A Western diplomat in Damascus ruled out any Syrian concessions over the  Golan.
"Syria is not like the Palestine Liberation Organisation," which signed a  peace accord with Israel on May 4 for launching Palestinian autonomy in the  Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, he said.
"Syria will never agree to signing a peace agreement that does not clearly  call for a complete (Israeli) withdrawal from the Golan. It cannot do less  than Sadat. It wants to do better than Sadat," the diplomat added.
The late Egyptian president Anwar Sadat became the first Arab leader to  sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1978 and to obtain a total Israel  withdrawal from the Sinai desert.
