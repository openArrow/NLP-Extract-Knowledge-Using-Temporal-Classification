The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  Friday rejected a North Korean proposal to keep fuel rods from a controversial  nuclear reactor in a "safe place under seal" ahead of resumed talks on the  issue, an IAEA spokesman said.
"That won't work. We will no longer be able to verify with certainty if  any of the nuclear material has been diverted," from the Yongbyon experimental  reactor, he said.
The North Korean ambassador to China, Chu Chang-Jun, told a Beijing press  conference Friday North Korea would keep "the fuel rods in a safe place, under  seal in order that the inspectors can verify that nuclear material has not  been diverted to non-peaceful ends.
"When the next round of discussions takes place between North Korea and  the United States and a technical solution is found, then the agency will be  able to take its samples," the ambassador said.
The IAEA said late Thursday that North Korea has begun extracting fuel  rods from its five-megawatt Yongbyon reactor in a "serious violation" of IAEA  inspection terms and said it would inform the UN Security Council.
The removal of the rods, if not halted immediately, could wreck the IAEA's  attempts to see if fuel had already been diverted, the IAEA said.
The agency called on North Korea to allow immediate inspections and to  delay the extraction of fuel rods until arrangements were in place.
"No North Korea response to our demands has reached us," the IAEA said.
The three agency inspectors in North Korea are attempting to check whether  any of the 8,000 nuclear fuel rods in the reactor have been diverted and used  to nuclear weapons.
The IAEA said it would still be possible to carry out inspections and  offered to send its top officials to discuss how it could be done.
