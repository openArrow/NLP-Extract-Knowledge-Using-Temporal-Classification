Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher refused  Thursday to testify to a parliamentary committee over the Pergau Dam  arms-for-aid scandal.
In a letter published Thursday, Thatcher said: "I do not feel able to  break the convention, established since 1945, that prime ministers and former  prime ministers do not give evidence to select committees on specific issues."
She was asked to appear before the House of Commons foreign affairs select  committee probing the circumstances of Britain's 234 million pound (351  million dollar) aid package to Malaysia for the construction of the  hydro-electric dam on the Pergau river.
A barrage of press reports have charged that the aid was given in exchange  for an arms contract valued at an estimated billion pounds (1.5 billion  dollars).
The reports said the contract was sealed personally in 1988 by Thatcher,  then head of government, in contravention of ministerial procedures.
Thatcher said that in select committee hearings "evidence is given by  ministers who have departmental responsibility for the subjects under  discussion.
She added: "You will know that I adhered strictly to this convention when  I was in office."
In December the former premier agreed to testify to the Iraq-gate inquiry  into illegal sales to Baghdad of material with military applications shortly  before the Gulf War.
Press revelations on the Pergau affair prompted Malaysia to slap a boycott  on trade with British firms in February.
Earlier Thursday in Kuala Lumpur government sources said Malaysia was  likely to lift the boycott soon, possibly during a visit next month by British  Trade Minister Richard Needham.
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is believed to have already  agreed to end the ban following recent consultations with British Premier John  Major, the sources said.
