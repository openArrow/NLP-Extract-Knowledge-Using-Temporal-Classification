A top anti-contraband police officer in China's  southern Zhuhai city was executed Sunday after he was convicted of helping to  smuggle cigarettes.
Yang Mingji was taken to a remote mountain area to be shot immediately  after the sentence was handed down by the Zhuhai Intermediate People's Court,  Portugal's Lusa News Agency reported from Macau.
Video footage of the trial -- conducted before 300 police officers -- was  carried on Hong Kong television, in which Yang could be heard shouting "not  guilty" while members of his family wailed in grief.
Yang, a member of the para-military People's Armed Police, was head of the  anti-contraband group and vice director of the "frontier squad" on Sanzao  Island, a section of Zhuhai.
Quoting court sources, Lusa said Yang was accused of having abetted the  smuggling from neighboring Macau of 2,300 boxes of cigarettes in March and  April last year.
Yang's rank was not disclosed.
An accomplice, Lin Shouru, was given a life sentence, while three others  -- all police personnel -- received prison terms of seven to eight years.
