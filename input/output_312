Steffi Graf stumbled into the semi-finals of the  German Open on Friday, dropping a set to Julie Halard, but returning after a  rain break to win 6-3, 4-6, 7-5.
It was a miserable performance from the top seed, who mixed flashes of  brilliance with masses of unforced errors. Typical of her erratic play, she  dropped the 2nd set with a double fault.
Although unable to find any consistency, Graf took the first set after  breaking to lead 5-4, hitting a fine backhand down the line on set point.
But France's Halard refused to be disheartened, and claimed the second set  6-4, before Graf clinched a close match in the final set on a Halard netted  service return.
Graf said afterwards: "She played incredibly well. She just went for shots  that were unbelievable, so I tried to hang in there. She took so many risks  and everything she hit, she hit very well, especially her forehand."
Anke Huber abruptly ended the run of Russia's Elena Makarova in the  quarter-finals, winning 6-0, 6-1 in just under an hour. It was one of the  German's finest performances for some time, and she pressured her opponent  form beginning to end.
Makarova said afterwards: "I was really tired and couldn't keep my  concentration, and she was playing so fast. If I put the ball short, she hit  it so hard."
