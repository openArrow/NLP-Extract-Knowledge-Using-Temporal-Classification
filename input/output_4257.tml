Thirtysomething blues&#13;
It has not been a good year for the thirtysomethings at the French Open.  In both the men's and women's <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">singles</EVENT> only one player who has <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">passed</EVENT> their  30th birthday <EVENT eid="e3" class="STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">remain</EVENT> in the tournament. In the men's, Brad Gilbert, 32,  <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">carries</EVENT> the veterans' flag into battle against Andrea Gaudenzi, a <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION">20-year-old</TIMEX3>  Italian upstart, while Lori McNeil, who <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">passed</EVENT> the 30 milestone in <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE">December</TIMEX3>,  is not been <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="NEG" modality="none">given</EVENT> much chance against <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DURATION">19-year-old</TIMEX3> Mary Pierce.

Going bananas&#13;
Players' faith in the nutritional qualities of bananas is stronger than  ever. Following the lead of noted on-court nibblers Boris Becker and Jim  Courier, the senior players here <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">munched</EVENT> their way through nearly 810 kg of  the fruit  -- <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DURATION">nearly four a day</TIMEX3> per player on the basis of some  back-of-an-envelope arithmetic.

Hacks <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">lagging</EVENT>&#13;
"Those who can do, those who can't <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="NEG" modality="none">write</EVENT> about it," <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">sums</EVENT> up the dismissive   attitude of many players to the journalists who follow the sport. And on the  evidence at Roland Garros, they might have a point. In a competition organised  by the company that times serves on the men's tour, the best anybody from the  press could <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="could">manage</EVENT> was a 125kmh service -- a mere 100kmh behind the fastest  players. The general public <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">fared</EVENT> better: one talented amateur <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">producing</EVENT> a  192kmh effort.
