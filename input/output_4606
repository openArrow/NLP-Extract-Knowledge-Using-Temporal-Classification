HONG KONG, May 27 (AFP) - A leading human rights monitor rounded on  President Bill Clinton on Friday for renewing China's preferential trade  status, lashing it as "one more capitulation" that would imperil dozens of  activists for democracy.
The organisation, Human Rights Watch/Asia, scorned Clinton's assessment  that China had complied with several conditions on human rights that he linked  to renewal of most-favoured-nation status, which gives Chinese goods lucrative  customs access to the US market.
"Far from improving, the overall human rights situation has significantly  worsened in the year since (Clinton's) executive order (on MFN conditions) was  issued," the group said in a statement issued here.
The decision was "one more capitulation on human rights," the statement  saud.
"President Clinton has effectively removed all pressure on China to  improve its human rights practices," said Sidney Jones, Human Rights  Watch/Asia's exeuctive director.
"Clinton has left his administration looking vacillating and hypocritical,  while the Chinese leadership, by contrast, has emerged as hard-nosed,  uncompromising and victorious. We're deeply disappointed by this decision."
Human Rights Watch/Asia -- formerly known as Asia Watch -- enjoys a strong  reputation as an independent monitor of human rights in China.
Earlier this month, it released a report documenting what it said were the  cases of several hundred protestors, seized in the crackdown of the 1989  pro-democracy movement, who remain behind bars.
The statement issued Friday said the leading dissidents, workers and  religious activists would now be more vulnerable to persecution and arrest,  given that Chinese leaders "understand that a crackdown would not bring about  a disruption of trade."
"Dozens of dissidents had their trials or sentences postponed while the  Chinese government awaited Washington's decision," it said. "Now they can  happen with little fear of persecution."
