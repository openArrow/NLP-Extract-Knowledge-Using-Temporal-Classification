The foreign ministers of Russia, the United States  and five western European countries will hold a meeting on Bosnia-Hercegovina  June 13, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Thursday.
Juppe, speaking on French radio, did not say whether the meeting would be  held in Geneva, where the foreign ministers held talks last Friday on the same  issue.
He said the upcoming meeting might be decisive in terms of future French  policy in Bosnia.
"We cannot leave our UN peacekeepers indefinitely (in Bosnia) if the  people they are trying to help have governments that don't want peace," Juppe  said.
France has warned in recent days that it would consider pulling out its  6,800 troops stationed in ex-Yugoslavia unless there was a breakthrough in the  peace process within six months.
Last Friday, the foreign ministers meeting in Geneva united in a bid to  put the peace process in Bosnia back on track, calling for a four-month  ceasefire and resumption of peace negotiations within two weeks.
They urged the warring parties to reach agreement on the basis of a  European plan for the ethnic division of the former Yugoslav republic,  providing 51 percent of the territory for a Bosnian Croat-Moslem federation  and 49 percent fo the Bosnian Serbs.
