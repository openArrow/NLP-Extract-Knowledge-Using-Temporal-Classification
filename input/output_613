Sinsegi Mobile Telecom, the consortium building  South Korea's second mobile-phone network, has decided to reoffer a share of  the lucrative project rejected by GTE, according to a statement published  Sunday.
The statement was issued Saturday after GTE Corp. rejected the  consortium's proposal to submit a letter of consent by Friday for its four  percent stake.
GTE was among four US companies chosen on Wednesday as foreign equity  partners in the consortium. Pactel Corp. was given a 10 percent stake in the  deal, which provided a 22.2 percent share for foreign participants.
The remaining 12.2 percent foreign stake was shared by Southwestern Bell,  which took seven percent, GTE four percent and Qualcomm 1.2 percent. But GTE,  displeased at the deal, has refused to join the consortium.
Sinsegi, pressured to speed up the delayed project, said it would take  action soon on alloting GTE's stake to other foreign firms, the statement  said.
The coveted project was to have been launched two years ago at a cost of  493 million dollars over the next three years.
The controversy over GTE dates from 1992, when its local partner, Sunkyong  Group, won the initial bid for the mobile-phone license but withdrew it later  amid charges of favoritism because of Sunkyong's family connection with then  President Roh Tae-woo.
After that, GTE threatened legal action against Sunkyong unless South  Korea ensures it the dominant foreign equity role in the consortium.
