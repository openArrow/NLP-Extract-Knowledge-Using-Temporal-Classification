Policemen and residents of a coastal village in the  eastern Philippines slaughtered a beached whale and feasted on its meat, the  official Philippine News Agency (PNA) said Monday.
"Excited policemen peppered the creature with Armalite (assault rifle)  bullets" when the mammal ran aground near Manito town in Albay Gulf last week,  then villagers carved up its carcass with axes and machetes, an official of  the natural resources department told PNA.
The whale is an endangered species protected by international agreements,  but Edgardo Bongalon, a provincial official of the natural resources  department, said the agency had guidelines about tortoise preservation but  none for whales.
