Oman will start producing gold in commercial  quantities in July after the discovery of large reserves, an Omani official  was quoted on Tuesday as saying.
Around 500 kilogramme of gold, extracted from copper ore by a new plant,  will be produced by mid-July and production could last 10 years at that output  level, said Mohammed ibn Qassim al-Yafi, mining chief at the Omani oil  ministry.
The period could be extended if more mines in commercial quantities were  discovered, he told the United Arab Emirates daily al-Ittihad.
He said an Australian company had completed setting up a plant to extract  gold at a cost of two million dollars.
Most of the gold reserves are based in Sahar province, also home to more  than 650,000 tonnes of copper oxide, he added.
Oman has stepped up exploration for mineral resources as part of attempts    to find new sources of income.
Like other Gulf states, the sultanate relies heavily on oil, of which it  produces 800,000 barrels per day.
