In a speech before the confidence vote, Berlusconi dimissed the calls for  him to dump the neo-fascists.
"I cannot accept a different government," Berlusconi said.
He insisted that his coalition, known as the Freedom Alliance, was the  product of a new majority-style voting system and that to jettison coalition  partners would flout voters' wishes.
"For the government to change there would have to be new elections," he  told the Senate.
Nicola Mancino, the head of the Italian Popular Party which holds 34 seats  in the Senate, had proposed on Tuesday that Berlusconi break with the National  Alliance and form a new coalition government with the centrist and some  center-left parties.
In his government program, unveiled earlier this week, Berlusconi said his  team of free-marketeers hoped to create a million jobs in two years and  planned sharp cuts in social security taxes for companies that took on new  employees.
Berlusconi has also said he wants to cut income taxes, eliminate other  taxes altogether and speed up privatization of state-owned firms.
Berlusconi enjoyed another victory Wednesday evening -- and by a much  heftier margin. His soccer team AC Milan crushed Barcelona in the European Cup  Final in Athens 4-0.
While the confidence vote was under way, Berlusconi slipped away to catch  part of the match on television, returning to the chamber after Milan's first  goal to applause from both political supporters and foes.
