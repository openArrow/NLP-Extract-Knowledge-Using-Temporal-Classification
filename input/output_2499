Hundreds of thousands of people are fleeing central  Rwanda as heavy fighting in the capital Kigali and elsewhere in the central  African nation causes a new exodus of refugees, an International Committee of  the Red Cross spokesman said Friday.
The CICR appealed for UN peacekeepers to be sent in as quickly as possible  and for the establishment of humanitarian corridors through the country.
Up to half a million Rwandans are believed to have died in ethnic and  political killings between members of the Hutu and Tutsi people that broke out  in early April.
