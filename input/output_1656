Pak Myong-Chol, president of the North Korean Olympic committee, did not  offer any reasons for missing the Ggames except to say: "Our NOC did not apply  before the deadline, which means this committee will not attend them."
The deadline for individual entries is July 4.
In December North Korea said it would send 505 competitors to compete in  27 events.
North Korea competed in the inaugural East Asian Games in China last year  but stayed away from the Student Games in the US city of Buffalo last summer  and the Lillehammer Winter Olympics in February.
