Luis Fernandez, who will train French champions  Paris St. Germain next season, was given a tremendous send-off by the home  fans at Cannes on Saturday when his team clinched the last available UEFA Cup  place for next season thanks to a goalless draw with St. Etienne.
Despite having to share the points with the visitors Cannes just pipped  recent French Cup finalists Montpellier for the last berth after Montpellier  were beaten 3-2 at Lyon.
