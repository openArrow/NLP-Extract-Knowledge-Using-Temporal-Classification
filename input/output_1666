A firm run by a Jewish immigration agency  recently produced Palestinian flags by mistake, the agency's treasurer Hanan  Ben Yehuda told reporters Wednesday.
The Hameshakem firm in Nahariya, northern Israel, run by the governmental  Jewish Agency, had been working on orders for car pennants from 28 countries.
But it did not recognize among them the Palestinian colors -- black,  white, red, green -- Ben Yehuda explained.
The shop supervisor thought it was the flag of "one of the many newly  formed countries in eastern Europe," he added.
Hameshakem, which employs handicapped people, halted production of the PLO  flags immediately after the error was discovered by a reporter.
Ben Yehuda said "it was a scandal" that the Jewish Agency, which   "incarnates the values of Zionism and the return of the Jewish people to their  homeland, should be used to manufacture PLO flags."
