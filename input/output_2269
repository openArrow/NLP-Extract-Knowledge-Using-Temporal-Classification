A homemade bomb exploded outside the site of the  1994 Miss Universe beauty pageant in the Philippine capital late Thursday, but  the blast caused little damage and no injuries, police said.
The explosion destroyed a concrete garbage box outside the Philippine  International Convention Center (PICC), where the pageant will be held early  Saturday, police investigators on the scene said.
The 77 contestants had been conducting daily rehearsals at the  government-owned buildings, but the practises were already finished and the  contestants had returned to their hotel when the blast occurred, they said.
Antonio Modena, a spokesman for the organizers, told AFP the bombing was  apparently "an effort to call attention to themselves, whoever they may be,"  and not intended to harm the contestants.
"I presume the authorities are taking the normal measures necessary to  prevent this kind of foolishness," Modena said. "I don't see why any group  would want to harm a group of young ladies who are not doing any crime or  (committing a) political offense."
The pageant has been criticized by at least one Filipino senator as a  waste of resources, while feminists decry it as an extravaganza sex show for a  country where 100,000 women work as prostitutes to survive.
Modena said he did not foresee a drop in attendance at the coronation  ceremony, for which seats have been sold for between 9,000 and 12,000 pesos  (333 and 444 dollars).
The ceremonies will be broadcast live to a worldwide audience.
