Two powerful blasts rocked Aden Thursday  evening, spreading panic in the streets of the southern Yemeni stronghold.
It was the first time that Aden has been hit since the Yemeni civil war  broke out
May 5.
The explosions sent residents scurrying to cellars, and a fire broke out  in the area near the airport.
A huge cloud of smoke billowing from the blaze could be seen several  hundred meters (yards) away, from the hotel housing most western journalists  covering the war between northern and southern forces.
Witnesses said an anti-aircraft battery adjoining the airport was hit.
It was not known if there were any casualties.
From the hotel ambulances could be seen racing through the city.
Reports said that east of the city, shells hit the first of a series of  checkpoints leading into the city.
