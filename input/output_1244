Some 17,000 Georgians are infected with rabies and  cannot be vaccinated due to a lack of medecine, Health Minister Avtandil  Djorbenadze was quoted as saying Tuesday by Itar-Tass agency.
The minister said the situation was due to the large number of stray cats  and dogs carrying the disease in the country and had worsened in the last  months because authorities were unable to collect refuse outside cities and  towns due because of a petrol shortage.
