A surplus in the German trade balance  grew by 27.5 percent in March from the figure in February to 7.4 billion marks  (4.48 billion dollars), provisional official figures showed on Tuesday.
A deficit on the current account, which also includes services and  invisible exports, meanwhile fell to 0.9 billion marks from a provisional 4.8  billion marks in February, the federal statistical office, which published the  figures, said.
The current account had shown a surplus of 1.3 billion marks in March 1993.
For the first quarter of 1994, the balance showed a surplus of 19 billion  marks which was about double the 1993 first-quarter surplus of 9.6 billion  marks.
The current account remained in deficit for the first quarter, at 8.2  billion marks, compared to a 1993 first-quarter deficit of 6.8 billion marks.
In March, Germany imported goods worth 53.8 billion marks and exported  goods valued at 61.2 billion marks. Imports rose by 10.4 percent from the  figure in March 1993 and exports by 14.0 percent.
Compared with February, in which there were three fewer working days than  in March, exports grew by 20.7 percent and imports by 19.7 percent.
Commerzbank analyst Peter Pietsch said the figures confirmed an upward  trend in the German trade performance.
The upturn in the international economy was beginning to be felt in  Germany, Pietsch said, while noting that most orders placed with German  industry had originated from southeast Asia, China and Latin America.
The statistics office said comparisons with 1993 remained difficult  because of new accounting methods under the Maastricht treaty. Definitive 1993  figures would not be available until September.
