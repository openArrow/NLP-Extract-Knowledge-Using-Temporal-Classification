A UN team is travelling to the Dominican  Republic next week to oversee a complete closure of the country's border with  Haiti to end violations of an international embargo.
President Joaquin Balaguer, who has opposed the UN sanctions to force  Haiti's military from power, ordered a complete closure of the border late  Wednesday.
The decision came after a meeting with US President Bill Clinton's special  envoy, William Gray, and Dante Caputo, the Organization of American States'  special negotiator for Haitian affairs.
Balaguer is facing a tough domestic fight since no winner has been  announced in the May 16 presidential vote in which he ran for a seventh term.  Opposition leader Jose Francisco Pena Gomez has alleged that the vote was  rigged to keep him from becoming the country's first black president this  century.
Caputo said that the United Nations would offer logistical assistance to  end the massive smuggling across the 300-kilometer (185-mile) border in  violation of a fuel and arms embargo imposed in October and an embargo on all  products except food, medicine and propane gas imposed this month.
The two nations share the Caribbean island of Hispanola.
The embargo was ordered to force Haiti's military to restore exiled  president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, ousted in September 1991.
In Port-au-Prince Thursday, the US embassy condemned the murder of four  political activists shot down in the sprawling Cite Soleil shantytown  overnight Sunday.
The embassy issued a statement blaming security forces for the violence  afflicting the Haitian capital and some rural areas.
Emile Jonassaint, Haiti's military-backed president, denounced what he  described as the "intolerable tendencies of some diplomatic officials."
Jonassaint also said that the embassy was going beyond its mandate.
