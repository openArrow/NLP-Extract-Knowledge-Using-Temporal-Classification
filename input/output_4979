Several thousand jobless French people took to the  streets of Paris on Saturday to join a march against "unemployment and  exclusion" from society.
Some 150 "permanent marchers" who have criss-crossed the country in recent  weeks to campaign against unemployment told a crowd which organisers put at  40,000 it was time to "finish with resignation and exclusion and (time to)  promote a different logic to create jobs."
Police put the crowd at between 6,000 and 8,000.
Some 60 organisations from across the country were represented at the  demonstration to call for the "abolition" of unemployment. Banners demanded  "everyone for work, work for everyone."
Some march organisers expressed disappointment that most of the country's  large unions, with the exception of the pro-communist CGT, did not take part  in Saturday's protest march.
