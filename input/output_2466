English First Division club Millwall, facing action  by the football authorities after a hooligan rampage this week, could be in  further trouble over comments by their chairman Reg Burr.
Burr was quoted in some newspapers on Friday as describing Derby defender  Paul Williams as a "physically aggressive and unpleasant player".
Williams was one of at least two Derby County players assaulted by  Millwall fans in the second of two pitch invasions during the promotion  play-off semi-final at the New Den on Wednesday night.
Later Derby manager Roy McFarland substituted Williams and the Rams' other  black player, Gary Charles, because he feared they faced the greatest danger  from the hooligans.
But Burr was reported to have said: "I don't think racism in football  exists in the way most people believe.
"It is just a shorthand way for supporters to let certain players know  their
feelings about the way they play.
"Gary Charles has not had any problems from our fans because he is a class  performer, who has behaved impeccably.
"Williams is just one of those individuals who attracts trouble and abuse."
Now Derby, who won 3-1 on the night and 5-1 on aggregate, will submit a  detailed document to the Football Association, who have charged the London  club with crowd control failure.
McFarland said: "We will make all our observations on the incidents that  happened at the New Den and the comments made since to the Football  Association.
"We will not be issuing any public statement, because we feel that would  be unfair."
Derby goalkeeper Martin Taylor was knocked to the ground during the  second, more serious incursion by up to 100 fans.
Later a mob of up 1,000 rampaged, overturning a BBC vehicle, in the car  park of the Lions' new 20 million pound stadium, which could now be closed by  the FA.
Sixteen fans were arrested and seven people injured, including six police  officers.
