Copper soared on the London Metals Exchange (LME)  on Tuesday, closing 43 dollars higher at 2,221 dollars per tonne, the highest  price since February 1993, in response to a further massive draw-down of  stocks and encouraging fundamentals, dealers said.
Semi-weekly stocks figures on the LME showed copper fell a significant  18,625 tonnes to 406,075.
"The overall trend is for copper to rise as there are strong fundamentals,  good short covering and stocks have fallen again," said William Adams, analyst  at Rudolf Wolff.
The price of copper has risen significantly because of prospects of an  increase in demand in Europe and the United States and because stocks have  fallen.
The other metals followed copper cup. Nickel closed 180 dollars higher at  6,540 dollars per tonne, a high point since the end of 1992, after having  risen by about 10 percent during the past three days.
Nickel firmed in line with copper and on the prospects of a strike at  Canadian producer Inco's Sundbury division where the current labour contract  is set to expire at the end of this month, Adams said.
The market believed that Inco had the ability to continue nickel  deliveries for only three weeks in the event of industrial action.
Tin closed 145 dollars higher at 5,800 dollars per tonne on strong  fundamentals.
Adams said that recent statements at a meeting of the Association of Tin  Production Countries (ATPC) were "promising" and if China kept to its promises  of a 20,000-tonne limit on exports, the fundamentals would be "strong."
Aluminium followed copper up, despite disappointing stocks figures,  closing at 1,375 dollars per tonne for an increase of 22 dollars.
Lead closed 7.5 dollars higher at 512.5 dollars per tonne, while zinc was  three dollars higher at 1,007 dollars per tonne.
