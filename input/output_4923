France, which gave the world the "French"  poodle, is now offering a way to keep it trim and clean -- cheaply.
An entrepreneur in this central city responded to what he called a "real  need" in recession-hit France by opening the country's first do-it-yourself  grooming salon for canines -- a "lav-dog."
Though Paul Bridet cannot claim credit for the idea, which he said was  imported from the United States, his month-old salon has caught on quickly in  a country keen on high fashion and whose sidewalks attest to the abundance of  dogs.
It can now cost up to 600 francs (more than 100 dollars) in France to drop  a dog off for grooming at a traditional shop.
But Bridet's cut rate prices run from 70 to 100 francs (about 12 to 17  dollars), depending on the size of the pet, for facilities allowing owners to  wash, dry and brush their dogs -- and finish off with a selection of special  dog "perfumes."
