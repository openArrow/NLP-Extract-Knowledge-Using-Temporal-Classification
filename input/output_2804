German league champions Bayern Munich,  playing without four of their key players, still showed up weaknesses in the  United States defence Saturday and scored a 3-2 victory in a pre-World Cup  friendly.
The United States switched to their five-man defence for the first time  this season, but still let slip one-goal leads.
Frank Klopas scored both of the American goals -- the first in the 21st  minute, heading in a ball deflected off Bayern defender Markus Munch.
Mehmet Scholl, who also scored twice, equalised 14 minutes later but  Klopas struck again two minutes later, blasting home from 12 meters after a  pass by Cobi Jones.
Christian Nerlinger put Bayern back on level terms 11 minutes into the  second-half, and Scholl scored the winner on the hour with a solo run in which  he beat both Reyna and midfielder Thomas Dooley.
Bayern were without sweeper Lothar Matthaus, defenders Thomas Helmer and  Jorginho and forward Adolfo Valencia -- all on duty with their national teams  preparing for the World Cup which starts in nine cities across the United  States on June 17.
There was little sign of World Cup fever Saturday. A sparse crowd of only  16,492 barely made a dent in the 80,000-seat Cleveland Stadium.
