China plans to open up its oil industry to foreign  capital especially through joint ventures, the president of the China National  Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) announced.
Wang Tao told Sunday's China Daily Business Weekly newspaper that the  joint ventures could search and develop oil fields in China and its offshore  areas.
Several large cooperation projects are already awaiting the government's  approval to start, he added.
Others deals could be sought at the world oil industry conference that  starts in Stavanger, Norway on Sunday. Wang will head the 54-strong Chinese  delegation.
China, which produces an estimated 140 million tonnes of oil a year, has  received around 15 billion dollars of foreign investment in the past 15 years.
About 20 percent of China's oil fields have been opened up to foreign  firms. More than 70 foreign companies tendered for licences to run 26 new  on-shore fields and 11 already in production. The results are expected in  August.
