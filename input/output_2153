But Kafelnikov, who has risen from nowhere to the top 20 this year and  will be one of the most feared unseeded players at the French Open end week,  was missing, having left for Paris early. But Volkov claimed there is no rift  with the team.
"He's taking a few days off. Maybe he's sick of tennis because he has been  playing so many weeks in a row. Everybody understands he's very tired and no  one blames him for what he has done," he said.
Chesnokov has different ideas, and was surprised to discover Kafelnikov  had left.
"We didn't do anything bad, but he just left. He didn't say anything. He  didn't say goodbye. If he doesn't want to play he should say, but we just  found silence," said Chesnokov.
The real reason behind Kafelnikov's dissapearance is money. When he was  chosen for the team he was only their third best player, but his recent  success has elevated him to number 1. The result has been a dispute over what  share of the prize money he should receive.
Volkov thought that Stich may have taken him too lightly, having not lost  to him since 1989.
"He has beaten me many times and maybe he was a little bit lazy," said  Volkov. "In the 2nd set he woke up a little bit but I realised I could play  better too."
