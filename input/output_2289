A subsidiary of US firm Vaalco Energy Inc. said  Friday it will raise production by at least 71 percent at its offshore West  Linapacan field in the Philippines following successful sidetrack drilling.
"We should be able to produce between 6,000 and 6,500 barrels per day  (bpd)," Alcorn (Production) Philippines Inc. official Ponciano Mathay told AFP.
West Linapacan is the site of the Philippines' only commercially producing  oil wells, but water seepage has drastically reduced output to only 3,500 bpd  from 15,000 bpd last year.
The operator drilled two sidetrack wells near the three producing wells in  an effort to boost production, which resulted in a stabilized flow rate of  2,830 bpd in the second of the two diagonal-direction wells.
The Philippine energy department said in its daily bulletin that Alcorn  has shut-in the well for final pressure build-up, and Mathay said production  would start "sometime next week."
The energy department has authorized drilling of 20 wells in several  prospects in the Philippines this year. Oil exploration is attracting foreign  interest due to the vast amount of resources and technology needed in these  areas, which are mostly offshore.
