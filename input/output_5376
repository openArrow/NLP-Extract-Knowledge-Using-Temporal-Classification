The Philippines on Monday deported four Sri Lankan  delegates to an outlawed private meeting on East Timor amid a mounting  diplomatic embarrassment over the ban.
The May 31-June 3 conference on alleged human rights abuses by the  Indonesian army in the former Portuguese territory has been temporarily banned  by a Filipino court, while President Fidel Ramos has vowed to deport  foreigners planning to attend the meeting.
Three other foreign delegates, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Mairead  Maguire and American university professor Susan Castillo were deported on  arrival here over the weekend.
Manila has also included on its list of banned participants Danielle  Mitterrand, a well-known human rights campaigner and wife of French President  Francois Mitterrand.
