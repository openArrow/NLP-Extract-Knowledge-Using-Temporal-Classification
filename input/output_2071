The stock market limited its losses against  rising bond rates and profit taking after two straight days of advances.
The Dow Jones index of 30 leading industrials was down 5.83 points at  3,727.06 at 11:00 a.m. (1500 GMT). Roughly 85 million shares were traded.
"People are still watching to see if the rally can continue," said Richard  Meyer, a trader at Ladenburg, Thalmann.
Investors were also hanging back in advance of the expiration of several  market indice-related options, he said.
Interest rates on the main 30-year Treasury bond averaged 7.30 percent, up  from 7.27 percent late Wednesday.
The long rates rose after the government reported that the US trade  deficit shrank a surprising 18.5 percent in March to 7.46 billion dollars and  that initial claims for US unemployment benefits last week fell by 14,000.
