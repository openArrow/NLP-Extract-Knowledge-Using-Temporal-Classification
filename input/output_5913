The Security Council decided Tuesday to  extend the UN observer mission in Angola for one month, and called for an end  to the renewed hostilities in the African country.
The council voted unanimously to extend the 80-member mission until June  30, but said the outbreak of fighting threatened humanitarian assistance.
The resolution approved by the 15 council members welcomed the Luanda  government's acceptance of international proposals for national  reconciliation, and urged the rebel Union for the Total Independence of Angola  (UNITA) to act in kind.
The council also said it was prepared to consider recommendations to  expand the UN mission if a peace accord is concluded.
Angola plunged back into civil war after the UNITA movement lost  UN-supervised general elections to the ruling People's Front for the  Liberation of Angola (MPLA) in September 1992.
