On Wednesday, Juppe had said France "cannot leave our UN peacekeepers  indefinitely (in Bosnia) if the people they are trying to help have  governments that don't want peace."
France, with 6,800 troops, and Britain, with around 3,400, are the two  biggest contributors to UNPROFOR. Spain has 1,487 men stationed in  ex-Yugoslavia.
France has warned in recent days that it would consider pulling out its  troops unless there was a breakthrough in the peace process within six months.
French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said 800 French troops deployed at  Glina in Serbian-held Krajina in northern Croatia would be withdrawn by June  15, and that 1,200 troops at Bihac would be deployed elsewhere in the region.
Juppe said Wednesday that the foreign ministers of Russia, the United  States and five western European countries would hold a meeting on  Bosnia-Hercegovina June 13, but he did not say if they would meet in Geneva as  they did last Friday.
The British Foreign Office spokesman said the two-month period cited by  Hogg was "merely a guideline and did not mean a precise deadline had been set  by anybody."
"Any eventual withdrawal of British troops would be in close coordination  with our partners," said the spokesman.
British Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind on Tuesday had warned that the  British UN contingent in Bosnia should not be taken for granted.
