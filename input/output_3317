The Palestine National Council, or  parliament-in-exile, is to meet in Gaza City to abolish a call for Israel's  destruction, an adviser to PLO chief Yasser Arafat said Monday.
Ahmad Tibi, an Arab Israeli, told Israeli television that the meeting  would take place after the appointment of the 24-member Palestinian authority  to take charge of autonomous Gaza and Jericho.
He gave no date, saying "it is not easy to bring together Palestinian  representatives scattered in different countries."
Before signing the autonomy deal with Israel in September of last year,  the PLO formally recognized Israel's right to exist and pledged to scrap an  article in its charter calling for the Jewish state's destruction.
