The 29-year-old Indurain's 1994 season was disrupted in March by a pollen  allergy which forced him to miss the Criterium International and he then  injured a muscle in his right thigh just above knee and pulled out of April's  Liege-Bastogne-Liege classic -- a race Berzin went on to win.
He did, howeve, return to win the Tour de l'Oise at Senlis, France, in May.
