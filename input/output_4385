Memories of the late Ayrton Senna  invade Emerson Fittipaldi's mind as he tries to set aside his grief and  concentrate on winning Sunday's Indianapolis 500.
"I try to concentrate on the race and I think of Ayrton," Fittipaldi said  after Thursday's final practice session here. "His presence is always there on  my mind."
Brazilian Formula One racing star Senna was killed four weeks ago in a  crash at Imola. Fittipaldi was a pall bearer at the funeral.
"It has been really tough this month," Fittipaldi said. "It was such a  shock. The first week here was really difficult for me. We just have to keep  life going."
For Fittipaldi, that means trying to become the first driver in 23 years  to win consecutive Indy 500 crowns. Only four racers have ever managed the  feat.
"You have to leave the work and the problems of the world. The race is a  new environment," Fittipaldi said. "You must switch off everything else.  Still, it's tough."
Fittipaldi will start from the outside of the front row, the same position  from which he won his first Indy 500 in 1989. Two-time Formula One champion  Fittipaldi went on to win the Indy series crown that year.
"It's nice to be out there," Fittipaldi said. "I remember 1989. Really,  anywhere in the front row is a good spot."
Fittipaldi dubs his Mercedes-powered Penske car "The Beast" and it has  lived up to the name, devouring rivals in the Indy speed quest with an  unprecedented  straightaway rate of 245 mph (392 km/h). No first-year engine  has won at Indy in 70 years, but the new Mercedes motor makes Fittipaldi and  pole sitter Al Unser Jnr favorites.
"It's going to be a fast race at the beginning," Fittipaldi said. "We will  have a quick start. Nobody is going to ease off. It will be a great race, the  most competitive Indy 500 ever."
