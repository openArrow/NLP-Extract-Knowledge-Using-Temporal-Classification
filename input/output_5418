The constituent assembly of the new Croat-Moslem  federation of Bosnia-Hercegovina on Monday approved Kresimir Zubak, a Croat,  as its president for the next six months.
His appointment was counterbalanced with the naming of Bosnian Vice  President Ejup Ganic, a Moslem, to the same office in the new federation.
Zubak, who has been the Croat leader since January when he replaced the  extreme nationalist Mate Boban, is untainted by charges of ethnic cleansing  against Moslems.
A moderate, he was chosen by Zagreb to put some order into Croat affairs  in Hercegovina and to make peace with the Moslems.
Haris Silajdzic, Bosnia's current prime minister, was nominated premier of  the new federal government.
Croats will occupy six of the 17 ministerial posts: defence, finance,  justice, trade, health and one minister with no portfolio.
The new federal institutions will not replace the existing ones of the  republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina, whose president remains Alija Izetbegovic, as  long as peace negotations with the Bosnian Serbs continue.
The federation agreement was negotiated in March and April in Bonn, Vienna  and Washington under the auspices of special US envoy for ex-Yugoslavia  Charles Redman.
The new federation is to consist of cantons with a high degree of autonomy  over decision-making.
