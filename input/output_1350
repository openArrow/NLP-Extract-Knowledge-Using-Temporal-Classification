The premier of British Columbia, Mike Harcourt,  sharply criticized Quebec separatists in an interview published Tuesday,  saying they wanted to "break up and destroy" Canada.
"In a renewed confederation, Quebec and British Columbia are natural  allies," said Harcourt, referring to efforts by both to lessen the federal  government's power and strengthen provincial governments.
"But if they decided to separate, we wouldn't be the best of friends, we'd  be the worst of enemies," he told the influential Toronto Globe and Mail,  adding that if French-speaking Quebec becomes independent it should not be  allowed to keep northern territories granted by the federal government at the  turn of the century.
Quebec's provincial opposition Parti Quebecois has said that if it  prevails in provincial elections before the end of the year it will call a  referendum on independence.
The Parti Quebecois's Jacques Parizeau and provincial premier Daniel  Johnson are neck and neck in opinion polls.
The interview with Harcourt came on the second day of a visit to Paris by  Lucien Bouchard, leader of the Bloc Quebecois. As leader of the Bloc, the  Parti Quebecois separatist ally in the Canadian House of Commons, Bouchard  also holds the official title of leader of the opposition in the federal  parliament.
His visit to Paris has been sharply criticized in Ottawa, in particular by  Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet.
