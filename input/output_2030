Thirteen opposition supporters in Niger were given  light jail terms on Thursday for their part in antigovernment disturbances  last month in which one person was killed.
Charged with arms offences and damaging the public thoroughfare, three  were jailed for two to three months and the other 10 received suspended  sentences of six or seven months. Another 12 suspects were freed.
Unrest involving security forces, followers of the ruling coalition and  the opposition parties broke out when the government's opponents staged a  protest march in the capital as part of a civil disobedience campaign.
