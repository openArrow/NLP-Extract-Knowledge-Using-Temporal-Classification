Canadian residents bought foreign securities worth  some 1.8 billion dollars (1.3 billion US) in March, double the amount of  Canadian securities bought by foreigners, the government reported Wednesday.
Statistics Canada said the March purchase of foreign stocks and bonds by  Canadians was due primarily to Canadian mutual fund industry stepping up its  "heavy investment in foreign stocks" with non-North American equity funds  proving popular.
The March figures bring the average monthly investment by Canadians in  foreign securities since November to 1.6 billion dollars (1.16 billion US).
In February, just 700 million dollars (507 million US) worth of foreign  securities were purchased by Canadian residents.
The 900 million dollars (652 million US) worth of Canadian securities  purchased by non-residents contrasted sharply with the average monthly figure  of 4.1 billion dollars (2.97 billion US) in January and February.
One of the main reasons for this decline, according to Statistics Canada,  was a drop in foreign purchases of Canadian stocks in March -- just 700  million dollars (507 million US), marking the first time since November that  this figure had fallen below a billion dollars (725 million US).
