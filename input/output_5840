Three points will be awarded for a win  in Scottish League matches from next season.
The move, agreed at the annual meeting of the Scottish League on Tuesday,  brings the Scots into line with their English and Welsh counterparts.
Meanwhile Celtic have applied to play their home games at Hampden Park,  the national stadium, next season. The request will be considered at a later  date.
Celtic will also have to break with tradition by putting numbers on the  back of their famous green and white hooped shirts.
Parkhead players previously wore numbered shorts, but the League ruled all  clubs should use numbered shirts because of the risk of referees mistaking  players' identities.
