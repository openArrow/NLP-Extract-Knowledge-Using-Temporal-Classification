Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas has  criticised Lisbon for lax security for 41 pro-Indonesian East Timorese  pilgrims visiting Portugal, the Antara news agency said Friday.
The group was pelted with rotten eggs and garbage by a jeering crowd on  arrival at Lisbon airport Tuesday. Its leader, roving ambassador Lopez da  Cruz, was called a traitor and murderer.
The group is making a pilgrimage to the Catholic shrine of Fatima.
"I am surprised such an incident could not have been prevented by the  local security," Antara quoted Alatas as telling journalists Thursday.
He said if that was how Portugal welcomed a group from Indonesia visiting  in the framework of confidence-building measures, then Jakarta would think  twice before allowing any more such visits.
The incident came a few days after Alatas and his Portuguese counterpart  Durao Barroso met in Geneva for a new round of talks under the auspices of UN  Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to try to find an acceptable solution  to the question of East Timor.
Indonesia invaded East Timor on December 1975 and unilaterally declared  the former Portuguese colony its 27th province in 1976. The United Nations  still recognizes Lisbon as the administrator of the territory.
Portugal severed ties with Indonesia shortly after the Indonesian troops  entered East Timor.
