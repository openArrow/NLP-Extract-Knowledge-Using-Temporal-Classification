But Parreira, a physiotherapist with the 1970 side, is fully aware that  all the past bitterness will be quickly forgotten if he can guide his squad to  glory in the United States.
The team Parreira picks for Brazil's opening group match against Russia in  San Francisco on June 20 will be built around a core of experienced  Europe-based players.
Romario, who has scored 30 goals for Barcelona this season, will be  partnered upfront by the pacy but lightweight Bebeto, who also plays in Spain  with Deportivo La Coruna.
Despite Romario's objections, Muller, a veteran of the last two World Cups  who is now with Sao Paulo after a spell with Torino, is also likely to start.
The two other strikers in the squad -- 17-year-old Cruzeiro player Ronaldo  and Corinthians' Viola -- have only six caps between them.
Alongside Rai in midfield, Bebeto's clubmate Mauro Silva does the midfield  anchor work.
At the back -- for once a Brazilian strength rather than a weakness --  Parreira is spoiled for choice.
Ricardo Gomes, of Paris Saint Germain, and Ricardo Rocha, formerly of Real  Madrid but now with Vasco da Gama, are the first choice centrebacks. But  Benfica's Mozer and Marcio Santos of Bordeaux, who earned a last-minute  call-up ahead of AS Roma's Aldair, are an impressive back-up.
Cafu, Jorginho and Branco will contest the full-back positions, with  Taffarel in goal, backed up by reserve keepers Zetti and Gilmar.
After the Russian game, Brazil then face Cameroon four days later in the  same Stanford Stadium. They travel East to Detroit on June 28 for their last  group B match against Sweden.
