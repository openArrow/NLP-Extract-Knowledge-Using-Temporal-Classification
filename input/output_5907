A four-ship US task force with 4,000 Marines  and sailors is set to leave Somali waters in the next week, a senior Pentagon  official said Tuesday.
The force is led by the San Diego-based amphibious assault ship USS  Peleliu, which has been stationed off the east African coast since March.
Its mission was to back up the withdrawal of US troops from Somalia and to  evacuate US diplomats in case of emergency.
But the need never arose and the ships have little time to begin their  voyage back to the US west coast if they are to keep to their six-month  deployment, a senior defense department official said.
About 19,000 UN peacekeepers still are in Somalia.
A small team of Marine guards is stationed at the US embassy complex in  Mogadishu.
