The Security Council began debate Tuesday  on efforts to bring about a ceasefire and resumption of negotiations to end  the civil war in Yemen.
Oman, which takes over the chairmanship of the 15-member council  Wednesday, has said it would propose a plan to help reconcile nothern and  southern Yemen, which have been at war since May 5.
But an envoy to the United Nations from northern Yemen, Abdel Aziz Abdel  Ghani, has said that the decision to hold a council debate without consulting  Sanaa "set a dangerous precedent" and warned against meddling in internal  affairs.
But several Arab countries have been attempting to bring about a ceasefire  and resumption of talks.
The south has welcomed UN efforts to bring about a ceasefire.
The war broke out after a nine-month dispute over sharing power in Yemen  -- the product of a 1990 merger between South and North Yemen.
