France on Tuesday also voiced support for "the unity of Ukraine" in its  dispute with the Crimean secessionists.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said France backed the "respect for  the borders and the unity of the independent Ukraine that emerged" from the  old Soviet Union.
Juppe told a press conference that the Crimean issue would not be raised  during a meeting in Paris Thursday and Friday on European stability, since the  agenda only called for discussion of central European countries and the Baltic  states hoping to join the European Union.
