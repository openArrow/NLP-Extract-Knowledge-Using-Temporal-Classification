Another 21 people were indicted for vote-buying,  bringing to 404 the number charged so far in the island's worst election fraud  scandal, a prosecutor said Tuesday.
The 21 included Cheng Wen-tung, speaker of the Nantou County Council in  central Taiwan, vice speaker Chien Jung-liang, 18 councillors and one travel  agent, said Chang Chiu-yuan, chief prosecutor of the county prosecutor's  office.
The speaker and vice speaker allegedly offered up to two million Taiwan  dollars (75,471 US) to councillors and arranged free sight-seeing tours in  exchange for their votes during the speaker and deputy speaker elections on  March 1, Chang said.
He recommended jail sentences of two years and six months each for the  speaker and vice speaker, and two years and two months each for 17  councillors, and three years and six months for another councillor, Chang  Ta-cheng, who was allegedly found using drugs during the trip.
The travel agent, Chen Chao-liang, was charged for trying to destroy  evidence on the organized tour, he said.
The government here was forced to take action against those involved in  the scandal to quell growing public anger. The elections on March 1 in the 23  city and county councils have been described as the most corrupt yet in Taiwan.
