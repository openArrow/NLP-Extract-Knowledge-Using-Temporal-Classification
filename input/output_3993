Andre Agassi was docked a penalty point for shouting  obscenties on his way to a five-set defeat by Austria's Thomas Muster at the  French Open on Tuesday.
Muster, the 11th seed, finally overcame the two-times finalist 6-3, 6-7  (5/7), 7-5, 2-6, 7-5 after 3h 43min in the most dramatic encounter yet at this  year's tournament.
Having been blasted off the court in the first set, Agassi repeatedly  rallied as the match seemed to be slipping away from him.
He was down 5-3 in the second, which he came back to win in the tie-break,  and trailed 5-1 in the final set before battling back to 5-5 only to drop his  serve.
Muster, who finally served out for the match at the third attempt, now  plays either Patrick Rafter of Australia or Lionel Roux of France for a place  in the last-sixteen.
Agassi, who had been shouting obscenities at himself all through the first  three sets, was given a warning for verbal abuse in the fourth after the  umpire over-ruled a linesman who had called Muster's serve long.
"This f...ing guy is incredible," Agassi reacted.
The penalty point came in the third game of the final set after Agassi,  trailing 0-2 and 0-15 at that point, had screamed "faggot" in reaction to an  unforced error.
Muster went on to take full advantage by clinching his second break of the  set and a 3-0 lead. Agassi meanwhile came within close to being defaulted as  he continued to angrily remonstrate with the umpire during the changeover.
