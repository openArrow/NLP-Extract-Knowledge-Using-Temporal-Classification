More than 80,000 people in the central Vietnamese  province of Quang Tri face famine because of poverty and bad harvests, said a  government report quoted Saturday by the unionist newspaper Lao Dong.
About half of those affected belong to ethnic minorities in the  mountainous region of Huong Hoa, according to a study this week by government  officials.
Some of these minorities are also facing extinction due to their difficult  living conditions and isolation, press reports said.
Although Vietnam is the world's third largest exporter of rice, with some  two million tonnes last year, it still suffers from occasional famines and  shortages in isolated regions due mostly to poor distribution.
