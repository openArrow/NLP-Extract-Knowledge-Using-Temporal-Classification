The Malaysian government has put on hold an  application by the University of London to set up a constituent college here  pending legislative changes, Education Minister Sulaiman Daud said Monday.
"It (the application) could not be considered as there is no legal  provision for it," Sulaiman was quoted by Bernama news agency as saying in the  northeastern town of Kuala Terengganu.
Sulaiman said following consultation with legal experts, the government  was drafting a law for tabling in parliament by the end of the year to allow  foreign universities to set up constituent colleges here.
Current legislation "has a different legal framework applicable to  government-sponsored universities," Sulaiman said.
The University of London was the only foreign institution of higher  learning so far which had applied to spread its wings to Malaysia, he said.
Officials said the decision to put on hold the university's application  had nothing to do with the government's February decision to boycott British  firms in retaliation for British media charges of corruption in  Anglo-Malaysian trade and in Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's administration.
Some 13,000 Malaysian students are pursuing studies in institutions of  higher education in Britain.
About 50 British universities and colleges currently provide twinning  programmes here to enable local students to acquire British qualifications  without having to undertake the entire course overseas.
