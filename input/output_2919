An attack by suspected loyalist paramilitaries on a  Dublin pub hosting an IRA fundraising event cast doubt Sunday over the  intentions of terrorist groups supporting continued British rule in UIster.
One man was killed and another injured Saturday night when at least three  men tried to push past a doorman at a Dublin bar where IRA sympathisers were  holding a collection for Irish Republican Army prisoners in Ulster.
The attackers also left a small bomb at the pub, whose detonater exploded.  The main charge failed to go off, however, and was made safe by police.
South of the border, there has been little of the violence which has  plagued the North since the "Troubles" between republican and pro-British  groups broke out in the late 1960s, but loyalist groups have signalled they  will target the South if Dublin shows any sign of playing a larger role in  Ulster's affairs.
On Friday, James Molyneaux, the leader of the pro-British moderate Ulster  Unionist Party, had appealed to loyalist terrorists to stop committing acts of  violence and admitted his party had had talks with elements "close to"  protestant paramilitary organisations on that basis.
Saturday's Guardian newspaper reported the paramilitaries were "seriously  considering" the Unionist leader's appeal.
The IRA also said Saturday in a statement it welcomed evidence that the  loyalist groups were thinking of ending their campaign against republican  targets. In its statement, the republican movement said: "should those  currently waging and directing the pro-British terror campaign desist from  their activity, ... the IRA would monitor the situation and review our  position on those responsible for this murder campaign."
However, the statement came just hours after the murder of a British  soldier in Armagh for what the IRA called "monitoring the movements" of one of  its men.
