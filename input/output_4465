He was accused of passing up opportunities to create a real opposition  party in favor of what critics called opportunistic alliances with both the  Liberals and Conservatives. Navarro even took the post of health minister  under President Cesar Gaviria.
In fact, Navarro, who became head of the M-19 after the 1990 killing of  its charismatic leader Carlos Pizarro, seems determined to put his guerrilla  past behind him, in particular the 1985 assault on the Palace of Justice.
The more than 100 dead included the Supreme Court president and 10 other  judges.
His strategy of doing whatever it takes to convince Colombians that the  M-19 has become a social democratic party appears to have failed.
But, to avoid being forgotten completely, Navarro burst into a television  studio during a debate between Pastrana and Samper on March 13. It was the  sort of guerrilla action he had sworn off in happier days.
