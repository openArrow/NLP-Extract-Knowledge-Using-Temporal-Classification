The Crimean parliament on Thursday  postponed "at least until Friday" a decision on whether to suspend  independence moves which have put the Russian-dominated peninsula on a  collision course with Kiev.
The parliament designated four deputies and five jurists to study  compromise proposals brought back Wednesday from Kiev after talks there  between Crimean and Ukrainian representatives.
The Crimean deputies decided that they would only vote on whether to  suspend the adoption of a 1992 constitution once the working group had  submitted its conclusions. Ukraine has given Crimea until Monday to reverse  the decision.
Crimea touched off a crisis with Kiev last Friday by voting for the  constitution which Ukraine considers to be tantamount to a declaration of  independence.
But pro-Russian Crimean leader Yuri Meshkov, quoted by ITAR-TASS news  agency, said Thursday that "peace and stability will be guaranteed" in the  Black Sea region.
"There is no threat. The 'hot heads' are surrounded by normal and calm  people and will not be able to poison things as they would wish, neither in  Ukraine, nor in Crimea," said Meshkov.
Also Thursday, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)  in a statement issued in Vienna said it was deeply concerned about Crimea's  move for greater autonomy from the Ukraine.
It called on authorities in the Ukraine and Crimea to seek a mutually  agreeable settlement to the crisis and offered to send a representative to act  as mediator.
