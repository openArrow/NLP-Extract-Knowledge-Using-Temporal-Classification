David Huish, deputy chairman of the Professional Golfers' Association, was  quoted as saying: "If Seve said that to my face I'd punch him on the nose.
"I can't believe it. If he's suggesting that members of the committee have  been offered inducements I'd take it all the way to the courts. It would be  like winning the pools."
Fellow Scot Brian Anderson, also of the PGA, said: "What Ballesteros might  have been offered has nothing to do with the committee. But if he is hinting  that present members of the committee have been offered inducements to back  the Valderrama bid I'd expect him to withdraw immediately and make a full  apology."
Phil Weaver, the PGA chairman, stated: "It is a preposterous suggestion.  To my knowledge no member of the committee has been offered any kind of deal to
use their influence. Seve is still trying to influence our decision from  the outside."
Other members of the committee are captain Bernard Gallacher and Neil  Coles, chairman of the European tour Board of Directors.
A replacement for Ballesteros on the committee could be named later this  week.
