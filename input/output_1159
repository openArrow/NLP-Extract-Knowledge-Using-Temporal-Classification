French Defense Minister Francois Leotard said  Tuesday that some 2,500 French soldiers would be withdrawn from peacekeeping  duties in the former Yugoslavia before the end of the year.
"We have begun a process of withdrawal of a certain number of battalions  we have there, first the one in Glina in Krajina (Serb-controlled territory in  Croatia) and then the one in Bihac" in northwest Bosnia, Leotard said in a  radio interview.
