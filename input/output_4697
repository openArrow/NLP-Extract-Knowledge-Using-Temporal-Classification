Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said  Friday that the US economy showed no signs of an inflation problem.
Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Greenspan said the economy  did not present "widespread indications" of resurging inflation.
"To date, underlying cost increases have been absorbed with little  evidence that they have yet passed through into prices for final products," he  said.
"If we are successful in our current endeavor there will not be an  increase in overall inflation," he said, referring to the Fed's four  short-term interest rates hikes since February 4 to ward off inflationary  pressures.
Greenspan defended the central bank's preemptive moves to curb inflation,  saying a delay in intervention would have resulted in a higher rate increase  later that would stifle growth.
"To be successful, we must implement necessary monetary policy adjustments  in advance of the potential emergence of inflationary pressures, so as to  forestall their actual occurence," he said, recalling that changes in US  monetary policy are not felt in the economy for at least a year.
"Our judgment was that with the financial conditions of both borrowers and  lenders greatly improved, such action wouldn't impede satisfactory economic  growth but rather would help such growth to be sustained," he told senators  reviewing the independent central bank's policy.
Greenspan's remarks came hours after the government said the US economy  grew three percent in the first three months of the year, sharply higher than  its initial estimate of 2.6 percent growth. Experts had expected a downward  revision to 2.4 percent.
An inflation index linked to US gross domestic product rose 2.6 percent,  unchanged from the original estimate.
The first-quarter GDP growth followed a robust seven percent increase in  the final quarter of 1993. The year-end surge triggered concerns that the  economy was overheating, and inflationary pressures would soon follow.
