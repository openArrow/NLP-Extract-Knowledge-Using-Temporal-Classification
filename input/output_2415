FIFA on Friday kickstarted a battle over the  allocation of new World Cup places when it endorsed a proposal to increase the  finals to 32 teams from 1998.
FIFA general secretary Sepp Blatter, who made the expected announcement  that this summer's finals in the United States would be the last with 24  teams, said no decision on allocation of the extra places will be made until  after this year's final on July 17.
But Blatter indicated earlier this week that he would be backing a formula  based on results at this summer's finals and UEFA, the European football  union, has already made a firm proposal to that effect.
UEFA want Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Caribbean/North American region  known as CONCACAF to be given one extra place each and the other four to go to  the regions providing the semi-finalists this summer.
In the last two tournaments Europe had three semi-finalists, with  Argentina representing South America, and in 1982 all four semi-finalists were  from Europe.
As Europe already has 13 of the 24 places this proposal is likely to run  into opposition and it puts UEFA on a collision course with the African  confederation (CAF), which said last month it would expect at least two, if  not three, of the extra places.
Only one African team, Cameroon in 1990, has ever reached the  quarter-finals of the competition.
Organisers of the 1998 finals in France have given their backing to the  proposed increase to 32 teams.
The World Cup was increased from 16 to 24 teams at Spain in 1982.
