Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Tuesday  criticized controversial remarks by a powerbroker and his main supporter,  Ichiro Ozawa, about women and a major newspaper.
"It's not appropriate," the prime minister told reporters, referring to  recent remarks by Ozawa, co-leader of the Renewal Party, one of the major  coalition forces in the government.
On Monday, Ozawa reportedly branded the mass-circulation Asahi Shimbun  newspaper as a "red newspaper" which practices "black journalism."
On April 16, Asahi quoted Ozawa as saying at a meeting that "one is free  to sleep with the woman of one's choice." He allegedly added, "It's none of  your business."
Ozawa reportedly made the controversial remarks when he spoke about the  formation of a parliamentary union by ruling parties.
The Social Democratic Party withdrew from the ruling coalition when other  government parties formed the parliamentary group, called Kaishin  (Renovation), shortly before Hata formed his cabinet on April 28.
