A panel investigating the March 23  assassination of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio voted  surprisingly Tuesday to disband, charging the government had failed to  cooperate in the probe.
The five-member commission appointed by President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari said its investigation had received no official support or access to  the official investigation.
The disbanding of the commission further clouds the situation surrounding  the slaying amid suggestions of a political conspiracy, possibly even  involving members of Colosio's own ruling party.
Colosio, the candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party  (PRI), was gunned down at a Tijuana rally five months ahead of the August  elections, creating political turmoil in Mexico.
The gunman, Mario Aburto Martinez, has claimed to have acted alone, but  four others have been arrested or are under investigation, all former police  officers who were members of a shadowy "Tucan group."
The criminal investigation has been led by an assistant prosecutor, a move  seen as unusual because it would normally have been handled by a special unit  of the justice ministry.
Prosecutor Miguel Montes has said the killing resulted from a "concerted  action," but has declined to elaborate.
