President Joaquim Chissano headed Tuesday for  public rallies in farflung northern districts of Mozambique on a tour  apparently aimed at whipping up support ahead of October elections.
He arrived Monday in the northern province of Nampula, Mozambique's most  populous, accompanied by an entourage of ministers, including those holding  the defence, education, and construction portfolios.
On his arrival, Chissano was greeted by thousands of people, some waving  banners in his support but a few denouncing his government, according to local  news reports from Nampula.
They said a group of Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO) opposition  youth league members appeared at the airport with banners saying: "We want a  government that makes us feel Mozambique is our own country, and not a heaven  on earth for Asians".
Traders of Asian origin dominate commerce in many coastal cities of the  country and periodically come under attack from resentful nationalists.
Chissano later met the provincial government in Nampula city, which  reported continuing hostile relations with RENAMO, the former rebel group  which signed a peace accord to end civil war in 1992.
Following the peace accord, Chissano agreed to appoint three RENAMO  advisers to each of the nation's 10 provincial governors, with the task of  easing the reintegration of a land split by war into government and  RENAMO-held territory.     Nampula provincial governor Alfredo Gamito told the  president: "I seriously doubt whether anything positive will come of it  (having the advisers) and I doubt whether RENAMO's so-called 'administration'  (of zones under its control) is anything other than pure invention".
President Chissano was to meet Tuesday with the Malema district government  before staging a public rally and travelling on to Lalaua in the afternoon.
