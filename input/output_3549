Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk will travel to  Luxembourg next month to sign a partnership and cooperation agreement with the  European Union, deputy foreign minister Alexander Makarenko said Tuesday.
Makarenko told AFP that Kravchuk would visit Luxembourg on June 12-14.
The foreign ministry official said that British Foreign Secretary Douglas  Hurd, currently visiting Kiev, told him that Ukraine's closer ties with the EU  would "create a different political climate."
Hurd said that member-states of the EU would guarantee the territorial  integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, Makarenko said.
