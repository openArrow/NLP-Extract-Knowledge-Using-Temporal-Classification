A leader of Japan's Social Democratic Party urged  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Thursday to step down and clear the way for a  revamped coalition that could include the SDP, which quit the government last  month.
SDP Secretary-general Wataru Kubo told reporters following a meeting with  Hata: "I told him a voluntary resignation is one of the possibilities, if he  wants to form a new coalition government and stabilise his power base."
During the meeting, Kubo reiterated a warning that Hata, managing a  minority government, would be easily forced to resign or call general  elections once a no-confidence motion was submitted.
Kubo made the remarks days after he and SDP chairman Tomiichi Murayama  indicated their party might be willing to return to the ruling camp if Hata  resigned voluntarily.
The SDP angrily walked out from the government last month following  infighting, forcing Hata to head the nation's first minority administration in  almost four decades.
Hata, declining to clarify his stance over Kubo's remarks, saying: "Mr.  Kubo just showed one of the possible ideas. I'm not in a position to comment  on (any resignation)."
