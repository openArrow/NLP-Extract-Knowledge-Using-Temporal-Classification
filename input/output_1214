American teenager Michael Fay seems all right  after receiving four lashes of a rattan cane on his bare buttocks two weeks  ago for vandalising cars, his mother said Tuesday after visiting her son in  jail.
"He seems to be okay. We weren't able to see the wounds but he said  (prison officials) have been treating them for him," Randy Chan told reporters  outside Queenstown Remand Prison.
Chan spent 40 minutes in jail accompanied by her second husband Marco and  an unidentified female friend of Fay's. They are the only outsiders, after US  embassy official John Coe, who have seen the 18-year-old after his  controversial May 5 caning.
Singapore's Prisons Department has denied claims by George Fay, the  teenager's father, and his US lawyer Theodore Simon that the lashing bloodied  Michael Fay, leaving him in constant pain and unable to sit during the May 6  meeting with Coe.
Fay was ordered caned six times after he pleaded guilty to spray painting  cars, pelting them with eggs and keeping stolen property.
But the Singapore government reduced his sentence to four lashes after  President Bill Clinton sought clemency.
Fay is also serving a four-month jail term but is expected to be granted  early release on June 21 for good behaviour.
Chan, who declined comment when asked how Fay was eating or sleeping, said  her son was looking forward to his release. "I think there will be a lot more  to be said at that time," she said.
Fay is one of five children of expatriate workers who were arrested in  October last year after local newspapers reported several cases of vandalism.
He pleaded guilty to government charges, but later asserted that he was  coerced into confessing crimes he did not commit.
US newspapers, legislators and human rights groups have criticised  Singapore for caning the teenager despite their appeals that he be spared the  rod.
