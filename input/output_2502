Ukrainian lawmakers suspended the constitution of  independance-leaning Crimea, parliamentary sources said, after Crimean  deputies earlier adopted a basic law tantamount to a declaration of  independence from Kiev.
In the closed-session vote Ukrainian deputies gave the pro-Russian Crimean  assembly 10 days to "conform with the laws and constitution of Ukraine."
The text, presented by President Leonid Kravchuk, did not say what  measures the Kiev parliament would take against the Simferopol legislature if  it failed to reverse its decision.
Lawmakers in the predominantly Russian-populated republic voted  overwhelmingly Friday in favor of restoring a 1992 constitution that  establishes treaty relations between Kiev and Crimea, allows for Crimean  citizenship and provides for the establishment of a local militia force.
The vote came despite a warning from Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk  that Kiev "has enough power to force respect" of Ukrainian sovereignty.
Presenting the law Kravchuk condemned the Crimean deputies' vote as "a  step towards Crimea's separation from Ukraine."
In Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin said he had warned Kravchuk to  refrain from using force against the secessionist republic and that the  Ukrainian leader had assured him he would not inflame the situation, Interfax  reported.
