Some 200 rowdy demonstrators Monday  disturbed a public meeting in Hamburg held by the anti-Maastricht "Federation  of Free Citizens", leaving several people slightly hurt, police said.
The federation is headed by the German former European Commission official  Manfred Brunner, who was one of the speakers at Monday's meeting and is  heading his movement's list in the June 12 European elections.
Another speaker was the head of the Austrian rightwing Freedom Party,  Joerg Haider.
Blowing whistles, throwing eggs and shouting slogans such as "Nazis out",  the protestors rendered the speakers inaudible and tried to clamber over  barriers protecting the meeting, which was being held in a city square.
Police, who drove the demonstrators back with batons, made several arrests.
Brunner and Haider are planning a meeting in Bonn Tuesday.
