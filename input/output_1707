SARAJEVO, May 18 (AFP) - The United Nations will launch a campaign next  week to raise the 530 million dollars it estimates is needed to rebuild the  war-torn Bosnian capital, according to a confidential report obtained by AFP  Wednesday.
The report said the fundraising operation would kick off in Vienna on May  24 and 25.
The figure of 530 million dollars was just set here after a year-long  study by the Interim Coordination Board (ICBO), a body created last April  under UN Resolution 908 to determine Sarajevo's needs, handle the fundraising  and attribute the reconstruction contracts to international firms.
The ICBO assessment was led by its chairmen, William Eagleton of the  United States and Edouard Rousselot of France.
Rousselot said their report estimated 270 million dollars was needed to  get emergency services in working order within six weeks, and another 260  million dollars for what were called medium-term needs over the next two years.
It is to be officially presented to the special UN envoy on ex-Yugoslavia,  Yasushi Akashi, in Zagreb on Friday, then go on to Vienna for the actual start  of the campaign, he said.
The report is divided into seven broad chapters: water, gas, electricity,  city services, civil engineering, city planning and health and educaiton,  according to Rousselot.
City services covers public transport, telecommunications and garbage  collection, while civil engineering includes airport management, railroads,  bridges, highways and public buildings.
Rousselot said that reinstating water, gas and electricity services "will  represent about 30 percent" of the 530 million dollars.
But he said the hardest task will be to persuade governments to commit  themselves to investing in Sarajevo's reconstruction.
The ICBO functions like an American-type trust. It now has no funds at all  and has operated up to now entirely off the UN budget in New York.
Its chairmen will present their proposals to donor countries and  institutions at the Vienna meeting next week.
Contributors will then be called to New York in June to detail their  offers to the ICBO, which in turn will open bidding on reconstruction  contracts.
Several international officials involved in the project have said the  Vienna meeting will be the first "moment of truth" to gauge how willing states  involved in the peace effort in Bosnia are to take part in the next stage,  post-war reconstruction.
"A certain number of Moslem countries are not even asking questions and  already have their money ready," said one of these officials who asked not to  be named.
But another raised doubts about French and British participation in  rebuilding Sarajevo after more than two years of war, saying he feared a  "return to the good old French way of saying 'everything will work out' while  not putting any money on the table."
Rousselot said in talks between ICBO and Bosnian officials, the Bosnians  have already questioned why France has shown no great interest in getting as  involved in the trust project as it has been on the ground, where its forces  form the largest contingent in the UN peackeeping force.
Recession-hit France has already spent three billion dollars -- nearly six  times Sarajevo's estimated reconstruction cost -- for maintaining its troops  in Bosnia and Croatia over the last two years of warfare, according to  military sources here who requested anonymity.
