Kuok Philippine Properties Inc., plans a stocks  rights offering and sale totalling 802.97 million pesos (28.7 million dollars)  to finance expansion and diversification, documents obtained Saturday said.
The Malaysian-Philippine real estate joint venture will offer 727.51  million pesos (26 million dollars) in stock to existing holders. An additional  75.46 million pesos (2.7 million dollars) will be sold to Eastern Securities  Development Corp., a local brokerage firm.
The documents, obtained from the official Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC), did not say what Eastern Securities would do with the shares.
Proceeds from the rights offering will be used to help finance the  construction of a three billion peso (107 million dollar) office complex in  Manila's financial district of Makati.
It will also go to raising the 480 million pesos (17.2 million dollars)  necessary for the company to acquire about 500 hectares (1,235 acres) of land  just outside Manila, to be developed into a "multiuse complex," in partnership  with two other unidentified real estate firms.
The documents also said that part of the proceeds would go to the 500  million pesos (17.8 million dollars) the company needs to raise to acquire  about 20 to 35 percent in an unidentified "major food processing and  manufacturing concern."
