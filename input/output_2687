Former Italian Christian Democrat prime  minister Giovanni Goria died aged 51 of lung cancer Saturday at Asti, near  Turin, associates announced.
Goria, an economist, led Italy's 47th post-war government from July 1987  to March 1988, heading a five-party centre-left team, and was several times  finance minister. He also once held the agriculture portfolio.
His most recent post was finance minister in Giuliano Amato's government,  a position he was forced to resign from in February 1993 amid a judicial  enquiry over alleged corruption.
Goria was implicated in several instances of paying backhanders to win his  party support in his Asti constituency, but always maintained his innocence.
Current Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, in a telegram to Goria's wife,  praised the late premier's "long, passionate and generous engagement" in the  service of his country.
