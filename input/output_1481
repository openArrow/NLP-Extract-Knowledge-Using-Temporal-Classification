Graf's unselfish attitude, her lack of desire to grab ever more riches for  herself, is reflected too in her wish to eventually set up a foundation to  help others.
"I do want to achieve something, for example giving people something they  don't have which I do have and could give. Once I stop playing, I want to  initiate something, like a foundation," she said.
"I do already help animals whenever I can, giving money. But I want to try  and help poor people because that touches me the most. When you live in a  healthy society, you sometimes don't notice it too much. You take it for  granted. But if you read a lot, it catches you."
As Graf goes into the French Open next week to defend her title, she does  so in the knowledge that she has really achieved all she wants in tennis.
For instance, getting back to world number-one was no huge deal for her  because she had already done it and the circumstances certainly took the  gloss-off of her achievement.
She's she has won all the Grand Slams a few times and setting records no  longer really interests her. But she will certainly not lack motivation as her  driving force for some time now has been to perform as close to perfection as  she can.
And that is what she will be doing at the new, enlarged Roland Garros  Stadium next week.
