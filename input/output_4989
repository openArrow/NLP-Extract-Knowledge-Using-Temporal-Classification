The second round of elections to a national  constitutional conference went ahead peacefully Saturday, with a  higher-than-expected turnout, national radio reported.
A boycott urged by opposition groups appeared to be largely ignored, with  voters turning out in force in the country's 30 federal states, according to  the radio shortly after polling stations closed Saturday afternoon.
The radio said the turnout had been "impressive" in at least eight states,  including Lagos. Sources in a number of other states told AFP that turnout was  substantial.
In a first round of voting Monday, voters abstained in large numbers in  response to a pro-democracy campaigners' call for a boycott. They described  the vote as a charade, saying the military had no intention of surrendering  power.
The aim of the ballots is to choose electoral colleges in each of  Nigeria's 30 states and the federal capital territory Abuja. These colleges in  turn will vote Saturday to choose 273 delegates to the conference, due to  begin June 27.
Another 96 delegates are to be chosen by the military.
The regime of Nigeria's latest military ruler General Sani Abacha, who  seized power last November, has said the conference will be a step toward  restoring democracy in the country.
