World number one Pete Sampras heads for the French  Open hoping to clinch a historic 'mini Slam' of four major titles in a row --  and he has the full backing of the man he crushed in the Italian Open final.
Boris Becker, swept aside 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 on Sunday, hopes the American can  go the whole way and emulate Rod Laver's feat of 25 years ago.
"I hope that Pete can do it," the German said. "After so long it would be  nice for someone to achieve this."
Technically, a Sampras victory at Roland Garros would not earn him the  accolade of a "Grand Slam" because his wins, unlike Laver's in 1969, have not  all come within a calendar year.
But Becker argued: "It should be called a Grand Slam -- a Slam is such a  rare thing that four in a row should count even in different years."
Sampras, 22, only dropped one set on the way to the Italian title, on a  clay court surface where he has traditionally been vulnerable. That  reputation, however, has now been buried.
Sampras will be playing this week in the eight-nation World Team cup event  in Dusseldorf, Germany. His coach Tim Gullikson will be there to help Sampras  iron out problems with his serve.
"I'm moving much better on clay and that makes me feel more comfortable  about my chances at the French," Sampras said. "I've got to be considered as  one of about five or six favourites.
"But court conditions will be slower in Paris than they were here in Rome.  I just somehow hope to come through and win at the French. If I cannot win it  this year, there's always next year or even five or ten years.
"That's one event that I really want to win someday. It would give me a  title that a lot of the top guys in the game have never had."
