World Cup co-hosts India and Pakistan have set  aside their bitter political differences in an attempt to ensure the 1996  event is a success.
"We are one on this," said Madhavrao Scindia, the former Indian cricket  chief who heads the Pak-India-Lanka joint organising committee (PILCOM).  "Nothing will stop us from making it a grand success.
"I am confident cricket will bring the peoples of the two nations closer.  The World Cup will be a significant event in the history of the sub-continent."
Ever since India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka pipped favorites England last  year to stage the sixth finals, doubts have been rife whether the joint bid  would work.
India and reigning world champions Pakistan have not hosted each other  since 1989. Ties between the two countries worsened in the past four years  over a Moslem secessionist campaign in Indian Kashmir which New Delhi accuses  Pakistan of fuelling. The neighbours have fought two wars since 1947 over  Kashmir.
But Scindia said: "We successfully co-hosted the World Cup in 1987 and  there is no reason why we can't do it again. Cricket is a religion in this  part of the world. Everything pales before it."
The 1996 World Cup, tentatively scheduled to be played between January and  March, will be the biggest ever with 12 teams taking part in the 37-match  jamboree budgeted at about 50 million dollars.
Seventeen matches will be played in India and 16 in Pakistan including the  final at Lahore's Gaddafi stadium, while four will be staged by Sri Lanka.
Scindia did not rule out the possibility of roping in Sharjah in the  United Arab Emirates, where India and Pakistan played recently in the  Australasia Cup, as an additional venue if necessary.
