The US Federal Reserve raised two key interest  rates Tuesday.
The US central bank raised the overnight interbank rate half a percentage  point from 3.75 percent to 4.25 percent and its discount rate from 3.0 to 3.5  percent.
It was the fourth rise in the overnight rate since February, but the first  for the discount rate in five years.
The Fed said the move was aimed at keeping inflation in check and  supporting economic growth.
