The dollar rallied slightly against the yen in  Europe on Tuesday in response to news that the United States and Japan will  resume trade talks.
The dollar closed at 104.85 yen from 104.27 at the close on Monday.
At the Candian Imperial Bank of Commerce, analyst David Coleman said that  a statement by US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor that the two sides were  resuming negotiations had not shaken markets.
The two sides had been involved in talks for many months and markets would  not react without seeing substantial results, he said.
But the development might halt the rise of the yen, he said.
During the last few months the yen has risen to record high points against  the dollar.
Dealers have said that the US government wanted to engineer an increase in  the value of the yen to penalise Japanese exports and persuade Japanese  officials to open their domestic market to imports.
The dollar firmed against the mark to 1.6525 marks from 1.6965 at the  close on Monday. The mark was not pushed upwards by an announcement that  German M3 money supply grew at an annual rate of 15.8 percent in April from  15.4 percent in March and compared with expectations that the figure would be  13.4 percent.
The Bundesbank has set a target for M3 growth this year of 4.0-6.0 percent.
The president of the Bundesbank Hans Tietmeyer had implied in Helsinki on  Monday that the bank would pause in its process of reducing interest rates.
These two factors, which would normally be expected to strengthen the  mark, did not weaken the dollar because dealers feared that central banks  might intervene to support the US currency, analysts said.
European currencies were steady. The mark closed at 3.4215 French francs  against 3.4175 at the close on Monday, at 963.75 lire against 965.25 and at  148.65 drachmas against 149.45.
Trading in the drachma was calm.
The dollar was being quoted at 1.6525 marks against 1.6465 on Monday, at  104.85 yen against 104.27, at 1,4125 Swiss francs against 1.4065 and at 5.6438  French francs against 5.6413.
Sterling was at 1.5065 dollars against 1.5050, at 2.4895 marks against  2.4780, at 157.96 yen against 156.93, at 2.1279 Swiss francs against 2.1168  and at 8.5023 French francs against 8.4901.
The price of gold fell to 387.50 dollars an ounce from 387.75 dollars.
