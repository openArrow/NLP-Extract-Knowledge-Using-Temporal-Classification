China's State Development Bank (SDB) is to pump  more than 800 million dollars into the country's cash-strapped power sector  which is struggling to meet increased capacity targets, the China Daily said  Wednesday.
The SDB, one of three new policy banks reponsible for reforming China's  financial system, will grant seven billion yuan (808 million dollars) in loans  to the power sector this year, the newspaper said.
The loans, this year's first batch, account for 36 percent of the 20  billion yuan the central government plans to arrange in bank credits in 1994,  with total power project investment is expected to reach 72 billion yuan.
