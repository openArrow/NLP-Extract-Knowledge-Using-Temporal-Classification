A determined Orange Free State  province defeated England 22-11 in the tourists' first match in South Africa  at Springbok Park here Wednesday.
Free State's performance underlined South African rugby's strength behind  the pack, with scrum half Hentie Maartens the perfect link as he brought his  backline into play and set up the victory.
The home side, who lost their captain Naka Drotske very early in the game,  ran in four tries to one and fully deserved their victory in a scrappy if  entertaining match.
Brendan Venter sparked the backs into action and set up the play that  brought Chris Badenhorst his two tries.
Blindside flanker Andre Venter, swathed in bandages, made a typical  bullocking run for his try and his substitute Jaco Coetzee took over to go  over for a try with 12 minutes left.
England's embarassment would have been complete if fly-half Dolf van  Rensburg had not left his kicking boots at home, succeeding with only one out  of six kicks at goal.
After leading 6-5 at half-time, England's energy waned and, sensing that  victory was within their grasp, Free State pressed home the advantage.
"We wanted to get off to a good start, but Free State are a very good  side," said Dean Ryan, the tourist's captain of the day.
"They ran at us all the time and it's something we are going to have to  get used to while we are in South Africa."
England play Natal in Durban on Saturday.
