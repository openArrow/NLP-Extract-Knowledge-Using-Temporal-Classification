North Korea's President Kim Il-Sung has said he does  not fear possible trade sanctions against his country, already isolated from  the world for more than 40 years, press reports said Thursday.
"What further sanctions, beyond those we have been subjected to, can be  imposed? I feel like saying 'Go ahead and try'," Kim said in an interview last  month, extracts of which appeared here in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.
The leader of the Stalinist state also issued a fresh denial that North  Korea's nuclear programme was aimed at producing atomic bombs.
He said his country, which has been seeking a dialogue with the United  States on the nuclear issue, would not do so if it were really capable of  making nuclear weapons
In the interview with the American-Korean editor of the Washington-based  US Asian News, Kim also ruled out the possiblity of China playing a role in  resolving the nuclear impasse, saying: "We are not a vassal state of China."
Meanwhile the daily Rodong Sinmun workers' newspaper Thursday once again  accused the United States of preparing a "military adventure against the DPRK  (North Korea)", said the official KCNA news agency, monitored in Tokyo.
"The U.S. is raising a hue and cry over the 'nuclear issue' of the DPRK in  an effort to find a pretext for a military adventure," said the paper, quoted  by KCNA.
"Strength and pressure never work on the DPRK," added the paper.
