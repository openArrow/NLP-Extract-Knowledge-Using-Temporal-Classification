Radio equipment donated by Germany for the new  Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation has been blocked in customs for two weeks  in a dispute with Israel, a Palestinian official said.
Israel has demanded that the Palestinians pay duty on the equipment, Saman  Khoury, the corporation's deputy chairman told AFP.
"Under the autonomy agreement there should not be any taxation on  equipment donated to us or bought by us," he claimed.
"We have been waiting for permission to go and pick up the equipment. We  do not understand the hold-up. It is clear in the agreement that there should  be no customs duty."
However the protocol on economic relations signed by Israel and the PLO on  April 29 notes that donations will be exempted from customs and import taxes  "if destined and used for defined development projects or non-commercial  humanitarian purposes".
It also covers only the autonomous areas of the West Bank town of Jericho  and the Gaza Strip while the radio station is being set up in Ramallah.
Israel's West Bank military administration spokesman Major Elise Shazar  said the Palestinians only raised the question in a meeting on Sunday.
"It is now under review and we are doing everything possible to help," she  said. "We appreciate that time is important to the Palestinians to set up the  station."
Khoury did not know what the equipment was or exactly who donated it and  neither did the Germany embassy in Tel Aviv.
But the deputy chairman said the corporation had 17 full-time staff and  hoped to start radio broadcasts in July from the West Bank town of Ramallah,  where a pre-1967 radio station operated.
Television services would take longer to set up, he added.
The corporation's chairman, Radwan Abu Ayash, was in hospital.
