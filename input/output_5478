The Syrians want peace with Israel, Russian  envoy Viktor Possovaluk said here Monday after meeting Prime Minister Yitzhak  Rabin.
"My personal feeling, and it's our view as a Russian co-sponsor (of the  Middle East peace process), is that the Syrian people and Syrian leadership  are interested in achieving peace with Israel," said Possovaluk.
Rabin urged Syria on Sunday to talk directly and secretly to Israel and  admitted the gap between the two countries was "wide and deep."
President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy, who toured the new Palestinian  self-rule enclave of Jericho on Sunday, told reporters Rabin had assured him  "the government of Israel will keep and fulfill its commitments in the peace  process."
Possovaluk said he had given the prime minister a message from Yeltsin  hoping that relations would go on improving between the two countries.
Rabin has strongly criticized Russia's attempts this year to play a wider  role in the Middle East saying Moscow must coordinate with co-sponsor the  United States or risk causing problems.
But Rabin said Israel would coordinate with the Russians, "so I thanked  the prime minister," he said. Russia was in constant touch with the Americans.
