Libya's foreign minister spent the weekend in Paris  on a private visit that infuriated relatives of people who died in a French  airliner bombing blamed on Tripoli.
The French foreign ministry said the minister, Omar Al-Muntasser, came to  Paris on a private visit but insisted he had no meetings with government  officials.
"He stopped in Paris on his way home from South Africa but had no contact  with government officials," a ministry spokesman said.
The spokesman insisted the visit did not mark a shift in French policy of  demanding full Libyan cooperation with the probe of the bombing.
Earlier sources said Al-Muntasser left Paris Monday evening.
Libya has been punished with UN trade sanctions in connection with the  French airliner bombing, the 1989 downing of an UTA jet over Chad that killed  170 people, and in connection with the bombing of a PanAm jet over Lockerbie,  Scotland in 1988 that claimed 270 lives.
The sanctions were first imposed in April 1992 and then tightened last  year.
The last time a Libyan foreign minister visited Paris was in 1991.
Francis Szpiner, a lawyer for relatives of the UTA bombing, protested the  minister's stay.
"This visit hits a raw nerve for relatives of victims of this terrorist  act," Szpiner said. "If it was an official visit, it is scandalous. If it was  private, it should have been barred."
Libya has steadfastly snubbed requests from France, Britain and the United  States to turn over Libyan suspects in the two airliner bombings.
