Boetsch was trailing 1-6, 1-2 when he called it a day against Italy's  Andrea Gaudenzi at the French Open here on Saturday.
The 17th-ranked Frenchman admitted the injury was something that had been  troubling him for eighteen months but which had finally worstened during his  second-round match this week.
The 23-year-old Halard, who has risen to 24th in the world rankings after  an excellent season, took just over an hour to score an impressive 6-4, 6-2  win over Davenport.
The 6ft 2in (1m 88) American, just 17-years-old and a first-round loser  here last year, tried to hit her way out of trouble from the baseline.
But Halard, recent winner at Taranto and runner-up at the Paris Indoor  Open, took the initiative and pulled her opponent out of position with  excellent angles and changes of length and direction.
"I knew I had to keep moving her around and keep the pressure on her,"  said the French player, always a dangerous underdog who holds victories over  many of the world's top players.
"I got off to a good start and forced her to make mistakes.
Halard, making her eighth appearance in the Championships, now faces  seventh-seed and 1988 finalist Natalia Zvbereva of Belarus.
The 22-year-old Arantxa Sanchez, the 1989 champion, was always in control  against Germany's 37th-ranked Barbara Ritter and now plays eleventh-seed Anke  Huber of Germany.
The other French success came when wild-card entry Alexia Dechaume reached  the fourth-round by defeating Italy's Marzia Grossi 6-3, 6-3. She now faces  third-seeded Spanish baseliner Conchita Martinez.
Martinez beat big-serving Brenda Schultz of the Netherlands in  straight-sets.
