It was a day of dreams and nightmares for players  trying to prolong their stay in the French capital for another week here on  Saturday.
Spaniard Alberto Berasategui, who upset Jim Courier in the final at Nice  last month, reached the last-sixteen of the men's singles at the French Open  by putting out powerful Russian newcomer Yevgeny Kafelnikov in straight-sets.
But a bitterly-disappointed Arnaud Boetsch, who had looked capable of  carrying French hopes into the final rounds, had to limp off the Roland Garros  centre-court with a groin strain after just ten games against Italy's Andrea  Gaudenzi.
There was better news for the home fans in the women's singles where Julie  Halard and Alexia Dechaume joined Mary Pierce in the fourth-round -- Halard  putting out ninth-seeded Lindsay Davenport.
It left only seven women's seeds in the event after six days play.
Berasategui admitted after his dismissal of Kafelnikov: "Winning the  French Open is a dream for me. But I have to take it match by match. I don't  think I can play better than I am playing at the moment."
He also admitted that he even if he got through the next round against  either Mark Woodforde of Australia or Javier Frana of Argentina, who returned  to the circuit in March after a three-month absence for hepetitis, a probable  quarter-final against big-serving Goran Ivanisevic could cause him problems.
"I don't like very much his game," said the Spaniard.
Kafelnikov, 20, a finalist at Hamburg and a semi-finalist at Monaco, may  have been suffering from an overbooked pre-Roland Garros schedule. But then  the towering 6ft 3in Russian probably had no idea he would have such a  successful season and have to play so many matches.
Neither he nor Berasategui could hold their serves at the start and the  first five games all went to the receiver.
But once Berasategui had taken the first set, the Spaniard never looked  back.
