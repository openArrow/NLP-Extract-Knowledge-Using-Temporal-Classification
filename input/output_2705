Students and youths in Pyongyang have staged an  anti-US rally calling for an end to the US-led "nuclear racket" against North  Korea, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.
Pyongyang's official news agency, monitored here, said the rally was held  in response to a proposal from the South Korean headquarters of the National  Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification  (Pomchonghakryon).
The alliance, which claims membership in North and South Korea and  overseas, is outlawed in the South as an organisation benefitting the enemy.
Speakers at the meeting stressed the need for an "unremitting struggle to  check the US imperialists nuclear racket, remove the danger of nuclear war  hanging over the nation and get the US forces and nuclear weapons withdrawn  from South Korea," the KCNA said.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed Thursday that  North Korea had begun extracting fuel rods from its Yongbyon nuclear plant  before the arrival of IAEA inspectors in the Stalinist nation to supervise the  process.
The IAEA Friday called the action a "serious violation" of its monitoring  terms and said it would report North Korea to the UN Security Council, while  acknowledging that the replacement process was not yet advanced enough to  prevent full inspection.
