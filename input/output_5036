Nancy Ramsbottom aced the par-three  third hole here Sunday en route to a third-round 71, holding on to a two-shot  lead in the Corning Classic women's golf tournament.
Ramsbottom who has never won in 10 years on the LPGA Tour, holed a  seven-wood at the 186-yard hole, where her ball landed 15 feet short and  rolled in.
Ramsbottom, who had led since Thursday's first round, had fallen into a  tie for the lead after Martha Nause birded the second hole.
After the ace, Ramsbottom completed a steady round for a three-round total  of 206.
The Corning Country Club course yielded few birdies in blustery winds.  Stephanie Farwig (69) and Pat Bradley (70), shared second on 208.
Colleen Walker (68) was tied with Nause (72) and Beth Daniel (71) on 209.
Ramsbottom, who has never led going into the final round of a tournament,  said she liked the feeling.
"I feel good," she said. "I like having the lead. If I can just maintain  my composure, stay cool and confident then I'll feel real good about it."
But with six golfers within six shots of the leader, Hall of Fame golfer  Bradley said nothing was decided.
"It's anybody's ball game tomorrow," Bradley said. "It's just nice being  in the hunt."
She said the leaders would be in bigger danger if the winds die down.
"The winds are swirling and they have played havoc," she said. "If the  fans are turned off, nothing is protected on that leaderboard."
