The Lillehammer Olympic Organising  Committee behind this year's Winter Games and Norway's environmental  federation are to be awarded six UN environmental prizes, a LOOC spokesman  said Tuesday.
The awards for staging the environment-friendly tournament will be made in  London on June 3, International Environment Day, during ceremonies for "The  Global 500 Roll of Honour" of eco-friendly enterprises.
Games organisers cooperated closely with environmental officials to ensure  the Games were as "green" as possible.
