Foreign ministry officials briefed diplomats here  Saturday on Lebanon's call for a UN Security Council meeting to discuss  Israel's kidnapping of a Moslem guerrilla chief from his Lebanese home.
Foreign ministry secretary general Zafer al-Hassan met with ambassadors  from the five permanent Security Council members, Britain, China, France,  Russia and the United States, to discuss the issue.
Lebanon has called for a meeting on the kidnapping, after Israeli  commandos snatched Mustafa Dirani from Qsarnabaa, northeast of Beirut on May  22.
He was taken to Israel where he is being questioned in a secret location  about missing airman Ron Arad, whose plane was shot down in southern Lebanon  in 1986.
Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares Bueiz has denounced Dirani's kidnapping as  "piracy which touches every level of human rights."
Bueiz, quoted by the press Saturday said the United States could veto  holding a meeting, but said "we have to put the UN Security Council's  responsibilites before it and it will either accept them or not."
After the meeting Russian ambassador Guenady Illichev said he would convey  Lebanon's position to Moscow for decision.
The US ambassador Mark Humbley said he knew nothing about US efforts to  discourage Lebanon from calling the meeting or of any possible US veto.
