US Senator Edward Kennedy has written to Lebanon's  justice minister voicing anxiety at the government's dissolution of the  opposition Christian Lebanese Forces (LF) party, Lebanese papers said  Wednesday.
In a letter addressed to Bahig Tabbara, Kennedy said he was disturbed by  the government's decision to dissolve the Lebanese Forces and arrest many of  its members and chiefs without waiting for the results of an investigation.
The Lebanese Forces has been implicated in the bombing of a church that  killed 10 people in Feburary and was dissolved on March 24 after the arrest of  deputy leaders Fuad Malek.
LF leader Samir Geagea was later arrested along with more than 20 of the  party's members.
Kennedy said he was also worried by a media ban preventing papers from  publishing any details of the inquiry saying it was a flagrant violation of  press freedom.
He called for the media ban to be lifted and for the investigation into  the church bombing to be speeded up.
The justice ministry spokesman confirmed Kennedy's letter had been  received, but said Tabbara had not yet replied.
