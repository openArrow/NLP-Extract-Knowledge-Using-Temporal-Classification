The United Nations has sponsored a new round of  peace talks in southern Somalia, but many Somali faction leaders failed to  turn up, a UN spokesman said Wednesday.
Leaders of a southern faction allied to warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid were  absent from the opening of the talks in the port city of Kismayo on Tuesday,  attended by the leader of a rival group, Mohamed Said Hersi, known as "General  Morgan," son-in-law of ousted ruler Mohamed Siad Barre.
Aidid's chief financier Osman Ato was there, but Somali analysts said it  was unclear whether Ato was still a close advisor to the warlord.
Kismayo, 500 kilometres (300 miles) south-west of the capital Mogadishu,  has been repeatedly battered by fighting between two rival factions of the  Somali Patriotic Movement, one led by Morgan and the other, allied with Aidid,  by Omar Jess.
Neither Jess nor other key figures from the rival SPM group such as Aden  Abdullahi Nur Gabyo turned up.
They were said to be "resolving differences between themselves" and might  come to the Lower Juba regional peace conference which is to last at least a  week in a few days, said spokesman George Bennett.
Previous UN efforts to broker a peace accord among Somalia's 15 warring  factions have failed to end anarchy in the war-ravaged Horn of Africa nation.
Peace talks including all main faction leaders are scheduled to open in  Nairobi at the end of this month.
