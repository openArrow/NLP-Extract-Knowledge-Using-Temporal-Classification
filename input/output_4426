In contrast to these positive developments, political detentions continue,  many prominent dissidents, including Wei Jingsheng, have not been released,  and the data provided on prisoners is incomplete.
3. Humane treatment of prisoners/prison access. The US government has  sought to implement this criterion by persuading the Chinese government to  allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit prisoners.  Following US representations, Beijing agreed to "expert talks" about prisoner  visits with the ICRC earlier this year. Two sessions have been held, but no  agreement has been reached yet, and no prisoner visits have taken place.
4. Protecting the distinctive heritage and culture of Tibet. In order to  implement this criterion, the administration has urged the resumption of talks  between the Chinese and the Dalai Lama or his representatives, which were  broken off without progress in 1992. In April, the Dalai Lama reiterated his  position of being willing to leave independence off the agenda in talks with  Chinese leaders. To date, China has not agreed to resume the talks.
5. Permitting international radio and TV broadcasting. The administration  has sought to end Chinese jamming through signal overlaps of Voice of America  Chinese language broadcasting. China denies it jams these signals, but VOA  claims a 40 percent signal loss. In March, Beijing agreed to Secretary  Christopher's request to receive technical data, which was provided in April.  Last week, Beijing invited a VOA/USIS technical delegation to Beijing for  further discussions. Thus far, the jamming continues.
