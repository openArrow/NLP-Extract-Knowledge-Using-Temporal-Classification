The Italian industrial group Riva said late Friday  it was pulling out of a deal to buy the giant eastern German EKO Stahl  steelworks, embarrassing the Kohl government in the region ahead of October's  elections.
Riva said it would not revise its decision "whatever new proposals are  made," the Treuhand privatisation state holding company said.
The move comes after two weeks of talks which tried to renegotiate the 100  percent buyout which was worth 1.1 billion German marks (700,000 dollars), one  of the most ambitious privatisation projects in the former communist East.
The deal came unstuck over differences between Riva and the IG Metall  union over the choice of a neutral member of the company's supervisory council  and the pace of job cuts, which would bring staffing down from 3,000 to 2,300.
The union has also questioned Riva's economic soundness.
The Treuhand said it would immediately get back in touch with investors  who had shown an interest in the company earlier.
The EKO Stahl works is a key employer in the depressed eastern German  region of Eisenhuettenstadt.
