The dollar closed moderately higher at 104.72 yen on  the Tokyo foreign exchange market Wednesday, up 0.25 yen from the previous  day's finish of 104.47 yen.
The dollar's advance reflected an overnight agreement to resume stalled  "framework" trade talks between Japan and the United States, which should  forestall upward pressure on the yen, dealers said.
Framework talks, suspended since February, are aimed at cutting Japan's  chronic huge trade surplus with the United States.
After opening at 104.75 yen, the greenback moved narrowly between 104.62  yen and 104.80 yen Wednesday. The closing rate here was slightly higher than  104.70 yen quoted in New York in late trading Tuesday.
Spot turnover decreased from the previous day's 5.838 billion dollars to  3.420 billion dollars.
The mark closed at 1.6555 to the dollar here Wednesday, against 1.6468 the  previous day.
