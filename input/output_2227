Kantor said that during the morning the two sides had discussed the US  conditions for the talks to resume, but refused to say whether progress had  been made on any specific problem.
The Japanese team is headed by Japanese deputy foreign minister for  economic affairs Sakayuki Hayashi and vice-minister at the international trade  and industry ministry Sozabaru Okamatsu.
Both sides have said they are anxious to make progress before the Group of  Seven industrialized countries summit in Naples in July.
The latest talks came as the US government reported the US trade deficit  with Japan jumped 25.4 percent in March to 5.80 billion dollars, the  third-widest gap with Japan on record.
That deterioration came despite an overall improvement in the US trade  deficit, as the gap sharply narrowed 18.5 percent from the February level to  7.46 billion dollars.
If Thursday's talks can reach agreement to resume negotiations the Naples  summit date could be used as a deadline for accords, a US trade official said  Wednesday.
The two sides are trying to agree on the definition of "objective  criteria" to measure progress in opening Japan's markets in the key areas of  government procurement, the auto trade, and financial services under a  framework agreement reached in July last year.
The government procurement talks cover computers, supercomputers,  satellites, medical technology and telecommunications.
