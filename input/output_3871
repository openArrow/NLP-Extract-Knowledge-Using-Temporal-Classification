Deputies of Croatia's ruling party, the Croat  Democratic Union (HDZ), dismissed the speaker of parliament, party dissident  Stipe Mesic in an overnight session Wednesday boycotted by opposition parties.
Opposition groups labelled the move "illegal and anti-constitutional".
The meeting had been called by the HDZ, which has an absolute majority of  seats in the assembly. With sufficient deputies present to form a quorum, the  HDZ members voted to dismiss Mesic and unanimously elect Nedeljko Mihanovic in  his place.
Opposition groups announced they would take the matter to the  constitutional court. Press reports meanwhile quoted Mesic as saying the  assembly now had two speakers, "one elected legally, the other elected by a  coup d'etat."
Parliament carried on with its daily business Wednesday without opposition  members present.
The quarrel surfaced Monday with the election of Katica Ivanisevic, an HDZ  deputy, to the head of a regional chamber in place of Josip Manolic, who left  the party in March. His replacement came after a compromise agreement between  the ruling party and the opposition.
In return for the election of its candidate, the HDZ agreed to allow the  opposition to choose two deputy speakers for the regional chamber, which  functions as a senate. But the HDZ then refused to accept Manolic as a  candidate for deputy speaker, provoking the opposition boycott.
Mesic and Manolic recently founded an opposition party, the Independent  Democratic Croats, to which 10 HDZ deputies have transferred their allegiance.     md/cdw/ss
