"I knew what to expect this time. In Australia I had never seen him play  and I was more prepared today," he said.
"I was two points from losing in Melbourne and after that match I came  through and won and that got me started for the year."
He said he had not thought of completing a non-calendar Grand Slam in  Paris next week.
"I don't wake up thinking about it. I never thought I would be in this  position so early in my career," he said.
"To me the French will be the biggest hurdle to get through. I'd love to  come through there one year. So many great players have won there and if I win  it at 22 or 32 it doesn't matter.
"When Laver won the Grand Slam he did it in one year and that's why he was  such a great player. In today's game I think it's tough to do it in one year."
