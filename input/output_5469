France called Monday for UN sanctions to be applied  against North Korea if Pyongyang should prove to have reneged on its  committments to give international inspectors full access to a nuclear reactor  at Yongbyon.
Foreign ministry spokesman Richard Duque said North Korea would have  committed a "grave violation" of its accord with the International Atomic  Energy Agency guaranteeing inspectors proper access to the site to check that  no nuclear fuel had been diverted from the reactor if it transpired that the  Communist state's officials had concealed "certain elements of information."
Were this the case, "the adoption of sanctions by the Security Council  would become indispensable," Duque said.
The international community suspects Pyongyang is developing nuclear  weapons, but Pyongyang says its nuclear programme has purely civilian aims.
Duque added IAEA directer general Hans Blix had sent United Nations  Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali a report detailing the situation in  North Korea and said the Security Council was due to discuss the issue Tuesday.
The IAEA said Saturday its mission to inspect the 5-megawatt site at  Yongbyon had failed.
