A German court Wednesday jailed a former East  German prosecutor for arbitrarily sending government opponents to prison, in  the first such decision since unification.
A Berlin court had handed down a two-year suspended sentence for a former  East German judge in January for what it said were too harsh sentences in  similar trials.
The prosecutor, a 61-year-old woman whose identity was not revealed, was  an aide to the chief public prosecutor in East Berlin between 1976 and 1985.  She has since retired.
"Those who were influential in East Germany like the defendant must be  held responsible," the presiding judge told the court.
The defendant was released pending appeal.
