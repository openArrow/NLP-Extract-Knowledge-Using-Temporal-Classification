Chinese President Jiang Zemin hammered home  Tuesday the importance of studying Deng Xiaoping theory during an impassioned  call for party discipline, just days before the fifth anniversary of the  Tiananmen Square massacre.
Addressing a special study class for senior party officials from across  China, Jiang, who is also Communist Party secretary general, stressed that a  proper grasp of patriarch Deng's socialist theory was essential to handling  the contradictions thrown up in the joint push for "reform, development and  stability."
"We must unswervingly follow the party's mass line and give play to the  initiatives of all sectors of society," Jiang was quoted as saying by the  official Xinhua news agency.
His repeated references to Deng once again underlined the backstage  importance of the ailing 89-year-old paramount leader, who has not been seen  since a brief television appearance during Chinese New Year celebrations in  February.
"It is imperative to correctly grasp the current overall situation in  China and solve, in a positive and appropriate way, prominent problems  adversely affecting reform, development and stability," Jiang said.
His speech appeared to contain a veiled warning to senior provincial  officials to toe the party line, amid official concerns over the growing  economic autonomy of developed coastal regions and the threat of social unrest  in poorer inland provinces.
Jiang's remarks came a week after Supreme People's Court president Ren  Jianxin indicated that the Communist Party had effectively lost control of the  public order situation in parts of China -- especially rural areas.
Ren, who is also director of the party's Central Committee for  Comprehensive Management of Public Security, said major efforts were needed to  resurrect and strengthen local party organisations that had become "paralysed  or semi-paralysed."
Stability has been the key theme of a series of speeches by top government  and party leaders in the past month, reflecting top-level concern over law and  order and rumblings of discontent in the countryside.
