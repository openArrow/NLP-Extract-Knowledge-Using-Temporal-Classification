Federal Police narcotics agents seized 300  kilos (660 pounds) of marijuana and 60 cases of heavy arms munitions during a  roadside raid, said police Saturday.
Authorities found the contraband Friday hidden in the rear of a truck  stopped at a fueling station some 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the center of  Rio.
According to police, the drugs were bound for Rio's "favelas", the slums  surrounding the city. Police believe the shipment entered Brazil from Paraguay.
