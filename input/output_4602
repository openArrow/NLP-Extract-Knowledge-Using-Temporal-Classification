Jim Courier looked close to his old best at the  French Open on Friday as he powered towards a probable quarter-final showdown  with Pete Sampras.
Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman was led like a lamb to the slaughter as Courier,  whose final defeat here last year kick-started the most serious slump of his  career, raced to a 6-3, 6-1, 6-1 victory in just 1hour 48min.
"I played an intelligent match. I guess he made some unforced errors but I  did what I had to," the American said. "I felt very relaxed and I made all the  right decisions."
With a comfortable 4th round tie against the winner of the all French  clash between Fabrice Santoro and Olivier Delaitre coming up, Courier should  have no trouble keeping his date with the world number one.
Friday's 3rd round win was a trademark demonstration of Courier's ability  to grind his opponents into submission.
A 4th game break gave him a closely-fought first set 6-3 and he  immediately turned the screw with a break at the start of the third.
The finest of drop shots and a bullet return of serve set up a second  break to put Courier 4-1 ahead. Another fierce return brought him a third  break and the set.
By the second game of the third, the Swede's confidence was in tatters. He  splayed an overhead smash at the net wide and then made two unforced backhand  errors to gift Courier his break.
From there it was one-way traffic and Courier wrapped things up with a  powerful mid-court volley.
The American, who has endured a miserable time that has seen him slide  from world number one to 7th in little over 12 months, was happy to feel his  powerful groundstrokes working smoothly but it was his intelligent use of the  drop shot at key moments that pleased him most.
"It is a shot I'm using more and more and on clay, when the courts are  playing slowly, it can be very effective."
