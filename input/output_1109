On Thursday, Rao and Clinton will meet for two and a half hours, then hold  a joint press conference at the White House.
Rao will also address the full Congress, meet high-ranking US officials,  attend a dinner hosted by the National Association of Manufacturers, and meet  with the Indian Interest Group, which represents US companies with investments  in India.
The 73-year-old prime minister is getting a frosty welcome from some in  Congress who accuse India of violating human rights in Punjab, the Sikh's  homeland.
Thirty-eight Congressional members wrote to Clinton this month urging that  he raise human rights concerns during his meeting with the prime minister.
Adding pressure, Human Rights Watch/Asia and Physicians for Human Rights  released a report Wednesday titled "Dead Silence: The Legacy of Abuses in  Punjab."
The report charges that Indian police murdered and tortured hundreds of  Sikhs during the decade-long insurgency in Punjab and that brutal  state-sanctioned methods are also used in Kashmir.
Tension is also mounting between the United States and India over India's  nuclear and missile programs.
Washington is urging both India and Pakistan to put a cap on their nuclear  programs in the interests of non-proliferation in the region.
But Rao is under tremendous domestic pressure to resist US calls to limit  the nuclear program and freeze its missile defense program, and the Washington  trip is his most controversial foreign visit in three years in office.
Rao leaves the United States on Friday.
