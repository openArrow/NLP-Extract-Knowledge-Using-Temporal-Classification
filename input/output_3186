Jyoti Basu, chief minister of the Indian state  of West Bengal, denied on Monday press reports that North Korea had requested  food aid during his recent visit to Pyongyang.
Basu, a member of the politburo of the Communist Party of India (Marxist),  said in a statement that the reports that North Korean officials had asked him  to arrange emergency shipments of rice from India were "absolutely baseless."
"I had talks with several leaders of (North Korea), including the prime  minister," said Basu, who visited North Korea from May 7-14. "But no one made  such a request to me.
"On the contrary, I was impressed by their economic development,  construction work and their confidence to meet any situation," he said. "The  news item is obviously intended to show (North Korea) in a bad light."
Basu, who heads India's sole communist state government, has been in power  in West Bengal for 17 years.
