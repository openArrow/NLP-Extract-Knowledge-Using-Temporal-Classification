As the death of the woman who became the closest modern America ever had  to royalty, dominated television and radio, tributes poured in.
President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, on Friday remembered her as  a model of courage and dignity.
"Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was a model of courage and dignity for all  Americans and all the world," Clinton said.
"More than any other woman of her time, she captivated our nation and the  world with her intelligence, her elegance and her grace.
"Even in the face of impossible tragedy, she carried the grief of her  family and our entire nation with a calm power that somehow reassured all of  us who mourned," the president said.
Lady Bird Johnson praised her courage.
"In times of hope she captured our hearts. In tragedy her courage helped  salve a nation's grief," said the widow of former president Lyndon B. Johnson.
The widow also of Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis, she checked in  Monday for the last time at New York's Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, where  former president Richard Nixon died earlier this month.
She decided to go home on Wednesday to die after doctors said nothing more  could be done for her.
Shortly before her death Onassis went into a coma. She had refused to take  medication.
"When she died it was very peaceful. She just sort of slipped away," said  Tuckerman.
A five hour interview with her made 10 years go by writer William  Manchester, author of "The Death of a President," remains sealed by a court  order until 2067.
In 1966 Onassis tried to block Manchester's book because it revealed what  she considered intimate family details. Manchester, who became a family  friend, agreed to drop some passages.
