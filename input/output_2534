slightly higher. Aluminium ended the week 5.5 dollars higher at  1,379 dollars per tonne in a market with little news as copper and nickel  grabbed all the attention.
Prices were boosted after reports that aluminium shipments out of  Rotterdam had jumped in recent weeks on strong demand from the United States  and Far East, and that Russian exports of the metal might be showing signs of  slowing.
Warehouse sources estimated between 20,000 to 30,000 tonnes of aluminium  were moving out of Rotterdam each week.
Weekly stocks on the LME rose 8,350 tonnes to a record 2,655,025 tonnes.
NICKEL: higher then lower. Nickel ended the week 20 dollars lower at 6,350  dollars per tonne after lifting Tuesday to a high since November 1992 at 6,540  dollars per tonne.
Nickel rose in the wake of copper and on the prospects of a strike at  Canadian producer Inco's Sundbury division where the current labor contract is  set to expire at the end of this month, said William Adams, analyst at Rudolf  Wolff.
The market believes Inco has the ability to continue nickel deliveries for  only three weeks in the event of industrial action.
The factory produces around 9,000 tonnes of refined nickel per month,  around nine percent of western production, said John Bergtheil, analyst for  Metals and Minerals Research Services.
Weekly stocks on the LME fell 246 tonnes to 132,270 tonnes.
TIN: higher. The price of tin lifted 140 dollars during the week, rising  after the other metals and on strong fundamentals.
Adams said recent statements from a meeting of the Association of Tin  Production Countries (ATPC) were "promising" and if China kept to its promises  of a 20,000-tonne limit on exports, the fundamentals would be "strong."
