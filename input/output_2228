"Romario is a genius, he showed that in that match," Parreira was forced  to acknowledge.
He has yet to completely lose his capacity for saying the wrong thing. He  caused a storm last month by rubbishing the qualities of his striking rival  Muller and was publicly rapped on the knuckles by Pele.
But Brazil know they can't do without him if they are to finally emulate  the team that Pele led to glory in 1970.
The player himself is confident they can do it.
"This is a very good generation of players," he says. "We've got maybe 25  players good enough to play at the top level and I think we can be compared to  the magic team of 1970."
Romario, who played in only one match in the 1990 finals having just  recovered from a broken leg, knows this summer will be his last chance to earn  himself a place in history.
"When I came to Barcelona I had three objectives. To win the European Cup,  get back into the national side and to win the World Cup.
"The World Cup is the most important because I don't see myself playing in  France in 1998."
