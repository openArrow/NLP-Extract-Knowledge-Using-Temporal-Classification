The United States has proposed creating humanitarian zones on the Rwandan  border but Boutros-Ghali has warned that the zones would attract non-refugees  from areas unaffected by the war.
The resolution was adopted after several days of negotiations between the  council members, notably between France, New Zealand, and the United States,  as well as between US representatives and Boutros-Ghali.
After the debates began Monday, the United States presented nine  amendments to the original draft resolution that had been proposed by the UN  chief.
As the negotiations drew on, US Ambassador Madeleine Albright, in close  consultation with Washington, began giving way to pressure from several  countries who insisted on the urgency of a decision.
A compromise solution finally breached Washington's strict guidelines for  UN peacekeeping operations and the need for prompt UN action to stem the wave  of bloodletting that has killed some 200,000 people in Rwanda and forced  nearly a million to flee to neighboring countries.
The resolution also includes a US proposal to establish humanitarian zones  for the protection of refugees. In the text, however, neither the number or  location of such areas are defined.
On the use of force by UN peacekeepers, the resolution recognized that  they "may be required to take action in self-defense against persons or groups  who threaten protected sites and populations, United Nations and other  humanitarian personnel or the means of delivery and distribution of  humanitarian relief."
After the vote, some confusion persisted on who would contribute to the  peace-keeping force in Rwanda.
UN sources said Ghana and Nigeria were confirmed contributors, while  diplomats mentioned Australia, New Zealand, Senegal, Zambia and Zimbabwe as  likely candidates.
