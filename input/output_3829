Talks have begun between North Korean officials and  inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the  refuelling of a controversial nuclear reactor, the IAEA announced Wednesday.
IAEA spokesman Hans-Friedrich Meyer said the talks being held in the North  Korean capital of Pyongyang would continue Thursday.
The IAEA delegation to the talks is made up of two special envoys who  arrived in North Korea Tuesday and two inspectors who arrived there May 17.
Meyer would not disclose who was representing the North Korean government  at the talks.
The IAEA inspectors involved were part of a three-man team sent to North  Korea to do maintainance work on surveillance cameras at the Yongbyon nuclear  reactor and to take samples from spent fuel rods.
The IAEA said last Thursday that North Korea had begun extracting spent  fuel rods from its five-megawatt Yongbyon reactor, 90 kilometers (54 miles)  north of Pyongyang, in a "serious violation" of IAEA inspection terms and that  it would inform the UN Security Council.
On Friday, the agency rejected a North Korean proposal to keep fuel rods  from the controversial nuclear reactor in a "safe place under seal" ahead of a  resumption of talks on the issue, saying it would inhibit verification that no  nuclear material had been diverted for military use.
The IAEA wants to measure the fuel rods to determine how long they have  been in the reactor and thereby calculate whether any plutonium could have  been diverted for military purposes.
