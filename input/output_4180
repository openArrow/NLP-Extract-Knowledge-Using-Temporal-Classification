PLO chief Yasser Arafat will not be authorized  to visit Jerusalem during his forthcoming trip to the autonomous areas of Gaza  and Jericho, Police Minister Moshe Shahal said on Thursday.
Arafat is expected in the autonomous territories around mid-June, on his  first visit in 27 years.
"Arafat will not be able to come to Jerusalem without an official Israeli   invitation," Shahal said.
"In terms of politeness, a person with a political function cannot visit a  foreign state without having been officially invited," Shahal was quoted by  Israeli Radio as saying.
He was apparently responding to an earlier comment by Yossi Beilin, deputy  foreign minister, who said Thursday that he was ready to "examine" the  possibility of allowing Arafat into Jerusalem.
"If the question of Arafat coming to Jerusalem is raised, it will have to  be examined," Beilin told Radio Israel.
Referring to recent friction between the Palestinian police and Israeli  forces and settlers in the autonomous areas, Shahal blamed it on "an absence  of understanding by the Palestinian police as to how they should operate."
"They have no bad intentions but they lack coordination. Otherwise, they  are fulfilling their tasks well."
On Wednesday, Palestinian police pointed a gun at General Doron Almog,  commander of the Israeli troops in Gaza who was on his way to Jewish  settlements in Gush Katif in southern Gaza.
And on Tuesday, Palestinian police in Jericho briefly detained five  settlers and confiscated their weapons, before handing them back.
