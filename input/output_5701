Singapore Tuesday announced it was opening its  telecommunications market, currently monopolised by Singapore Telecom, to  other companies in a bid to improve service and bring down prices.
Minister of State for Finance and Communications, Teo Chee Hean, said  competition "will meet Singaporeans' demand for better quality and greater  variety of mobile communication services at competitive prices."
Teo said the Telecomunication Authority of Singapore (TAS), the government  body overseeing the industry, would open mobile phone and radio paging  services to other companies in 1997, when exclusive rights held by Singapore  Telecom expire.
"This will be a major step in the liberalisation of Singapore's  telecommunications industry," he told industry specialists at the opening here  of an exhibition of telecommunications equipment by some 1,000 companies.
Teo said Singapore last year completely liberalised its telecommunications  market, allowing dealers to offer equipment ranging from telephones to  facsimile machines and modems.
TAS also liberalised mobile phone, paging rental services and  value-added-network services, like electronic mail and electronic data  interchange.
"As part of the ongoing process of market liberalisation, TAS will be  licensing a new public mobile data operator to compete with Singapore Telecom  soon," Teo said.
Teo said that government policy was aimed at ensuring that Singapore's  telecommunications industry remained efficient, innovative and competitive.
