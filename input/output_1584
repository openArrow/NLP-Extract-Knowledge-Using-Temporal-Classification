President Fidel Ramos signed here Wednesday a law  allowing more foreign banks to operate commercially in the Philippines, easing  more than four decades of protectionism.
The law, which fulfills a key requirement of the International Monetary  Fund (IMF) for approval of a 650 million-dollar program, allows up to 10  additional banks, from the current four, to set up branches in the country.
Businessmen hailed the new law as a boon to foreign investment and a  strong impetus for the modernization of the domestic banking cartel, which has  long been critized for inefficiency and extreme conservatism.
A 1948 law limited commercial banking activities to only four foreign  banks already operating here at the time -- Citibank NA, HongKong Bank,  Standard Chartered and Bank of America.
At least 11 European and Asian banks have expressed interest in coming  into the country under the new law, according to monetary officials.
"The main purpose of this bill is to promote foreign investment in the  country," Central Bank governor Gabriel Singson said.
The bank liberalization law had been toned down amid strong opposition  from some local banks, which feared being drowned by foreign competition.
Under the new banking act, the Monetary Board -- the country's highest   monetary authority -- may allow six new banks to set up fully-owned branches  in the Philippines, with the president authorized to admit four more.
But it limits the number of branches of the new entrants to six each, and  requires a minimum permanently assigned capital of 210 million pesos (7.7  million dollars) for each of the first three branches.
The next three branches must be capitalized at 35 million pesos each.
Other foreign banks may opt to purchase up to 60 percent equity in  existing banks, from the previous ceiling of 40 percent, or set up new  subsidiaries with local partners and own 60 percent of the shares.
