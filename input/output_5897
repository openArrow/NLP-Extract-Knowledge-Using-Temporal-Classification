Canadian military veterans voted  overwhelmingly Tuesday against allowing Sikhs or members of other religions to  wear headgear associated with their religious views inside legion halls.
The controversy was sparked off last year after Remembrance Day services  for Canada's war dead.
Sikhs -- invited by the Royal Canadian Legion to take part in a  Remembrance Day service in Vancouver -- were refused entry to the local legion  canteen because they were wearing their turbans.
The Royal Canadian Legion bans the wearing of headgear in its canteens as  a mark of respect for comrades who had died for their nation, although some  branches have relaxed this rule for Sikhs and Jews.
But on Tuesday delegates to the legion's national convention voted  overwhelmingly against forcing all branches to allow members and their guests  to wear religious headgear in legion canteens.
