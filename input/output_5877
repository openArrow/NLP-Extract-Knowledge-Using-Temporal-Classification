Salah Djebaili, rector of the Bab Ezzouar Science  and Technology University in Algiers, was killed Tuesday in a gun attack,  security services said.
Djebaili was shot as he was about to get in his car, parked a short  distance from the university campus in the eastern suburbs of the Algerian  capital, they said.
He was the third intellectual to be assassinated in the past three months.
On March 5, the director of the Higher School of the Fine Arts, Ahmed  Asselah was killed in an attack near the school's centre in Algiers, followed  nine days later by the murder of playwright Abdelkader Alloula, near the  culture palace in Oran in western Algeria.
It was not immediately clear who was responsible for Tuesday's attack,  though both previous attacks were claimed as the work of the Armed Islamic  Group, one of the most radical groups opposing the military backed government.
Moslem fundamentalists have been waging a war against secular  intellectuals and the government since the army scrapped elections in January  1992 which the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front had been poised to win.
More than 3,000 people have died in the fighting since then.
Fourteen intellectuals have been killed since Djillali Lyabes, former  universities minister and then head of the Institute of Strategic Global  Studies, was killed in March 1993
Algeria's current army-dominated government is led by President Liamine  Zeroual, a general who has backed "comprehensive" talks with the opposition,  including Islamic militants.
