Colin Montgomerie survived a 'squirrel scare' to  sweep Seve Ballesteros off the top of the European order of merit here on  Sunday by capturing the Spanish Open with a final birdie.
The big Scot, who won the 1993 money list with almost 800,000 pounds, took  his earnings this year to over 150,000 pounds when his closing 70 for an 11  under par 277 gave him one shot to spare over England's Mark Roe, Richard  Boxall and Mark McNulty of Zimbabwe.
It was Montgomerie's fifth European win and he achieved it with a  champion's finish after a red squirrel ran across the 18th tee as he was about  to drive.
His caddy Alastair McClean shouted to the Scot not to hit and Monty calmly  reloaded to hit the perfect drive and then an 80-yard wedge shot to within a  yard of the hole.
Germany's Bernhard Langer took fifth spot on 279 with Spanish stars Jose  Maria Olazabal and Seve Ballesteros taking a share of eighth place with 282.
McNulty's finale was even better than the winner's, striking a nine iron  from the light rough to within 15 inches of the cup for his birdie three --  but that only earned him a share of second place, on 278, for his final 71.
He lost his victory chance when he took bogeys at the 10th and 11th,  driving into the trees and then pulling a tee shot down a steep bank.
McNulty was still delighted, however, saying: "This is only my fourth  tournament of the year after I hurt my shoulder playing beach cricket during  the winter."
Langer blamed his poor putting for wrecking his hopes of a third Spanish  victory.
South African Ernie Els, who led the first round with a 67, repeated that  by claiming an eagle and four birdies to lift himself to a share of sixth  place, a shot off Ballesteros.
The Spaniard's 66 was the best of the day, equalling Montgomirie's score  on Saturday evening.
