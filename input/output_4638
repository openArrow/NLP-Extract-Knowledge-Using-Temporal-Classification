UN troops in the Rwandan capital Kigali on Friday  started evacuating civilians from the embattled city to safer areas of their  choice during a lull in fighting, a UN spokesman said.
Some 200 people were moved on Friday afternoon from areas controlled by  the rebels Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and those under government forces,  spokesman Abdul Kabia said, contacted by telephone from Nairobi.
The evacuees in the ongoing operation will include some 500 Tutsis holed  up for a month in the Mille Collines Hotel as the central African country  plunged into an orgy of ethnic massacres.
RPF fighters have kept up their push against battle-weary government  soldiers who have started fleeing the capital.
The death of president Juvenal Habyarimana in an alleged April 6 rocket  attack on his plane unleashed a tide of tribal bloodletting in which an  estimated 200,000 to half a million Rwandans have been killed.
Many of the victims came from the Tutsi minority or were moderate members  of the majority Hutu tribe, slain by extremist Hutu militias set up before his  death by Habyarimana.
