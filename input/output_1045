Ukraine will have sent all of its remaining nuclear  warheads to Russia for dismantling within four years, Defence Minister Vitaly  Radetsky said Monday, according to Interfax.
"Everything is progressing according to schedule," General Radetsky said,  adding that loading a train with warheads takes about one month.
To date, Ukraine has sent three trains carrying a total of 180 warheads to  Russia. By the end of last year, Kiev still possessed some 2,000 warheads.
The dismantling of the former Soviet republic's nuclear arsenal was agreed  in an accord signed in Moscow in January by Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk, his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin and US President Bill Clinton.
Ukraine inherited 176 missiles from the former Soviet Union, including 46  SS-24 intercontinental ballistic missiles with a range of more than 10,000  kilometres (6,000 miles), and 130 SS-19 missiles, which are considered  obsolete.
Kravchuk said Friday that all the SS-24s had had been deactivated.
