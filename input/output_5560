The Security Council's 15 members held an  emergency meeting Monday to review a draft statement on North Korea's nuclear  program, the UN announced.
The meeting came amid mounting concerns about Pyongyang's refueling of the  Yongbyon nuclear reactor, from which the United States suspects plutonium may  have been diverted for nuclear arms production. North Korea maintains its  nuclear program has only peaceful ends.
The statement under consideration calls on North Korea to allow the  Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to carry out full  inspections of its nuclear facilities.
The text has been approved by the council's five permanent members --  China, France, Britain, Russia and the United States -- who have been meeting  throughout the day.
The IAEA has said that without full inspections it cannot guarantee that  fuel is not being diverted to weapons purposes.
Earlier Monday, South Korean President Kim Young-Sam said the standoff had  entered a "crucial" stage because of North Korea's refusal to allow monitoring  of the discharge of spent reactor fuel rods.
Washington suspects North Korea has diverted plutonium in past years, and  says outside checks are essential to determine if the isolated communist  regime has embarked on a nuclear weapons program.
