Japan's International Trade and Industry Minister  Eijiro Hata said Tuesday he hopes high-level talks with the United States this  week would pave the way for an early resumption of bilateral trade talks.
Hata told a news conference the talks will be held Thursday in Washington.
A similar announcement was made by US Trade Representative Micky Kantor on  Monday.
"We have limited time," Hata said, stressing the need to break the impasse  in the so-called framework agreement negotiations, which collapsed in February.
Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice minister for international affairs at the  international trade and industry ministry, and Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy  foreign minister for economic affairs, are to be sent to Washington for the  talks.
Hata said, however, they would not carry specific answers to three  conditions for resuming the talks -- compromises in macroeconomic policies,  the purpose of the talks and objective criteria.
"Rather than bringing answers, we want to begin with reviews" on the talks  and each side's opinions, Hata said.
Kantor said Friday he had reached agreement with Japanese Foreign Minister  Koji Kakizawa on the need for preliminary contacts aimed at reviving bilateral  trade talks.
