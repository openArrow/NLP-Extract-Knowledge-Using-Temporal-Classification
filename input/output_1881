China is stepping up survey work and strengthening  supervision of fisheries near the disputed Spratly islands in the South China  Sea, the China Daily Thursday quoted the agriculture ministry as saying.
Ministry official Zhuo Youzhan said Wednesday a 37-member Chinese team had  returned to the southern port of Guangzhou on May 10 after completing the  21-day exploration in the region covering 3,398 kilometres (2,107 miles), the  first such project since 1949.
The team had enforced maritime regulations and compiled a survey of  fishery resources and weather patterns, Zhuo said, adding that "it is very  important to safeguard the rights of Chinese fishermen in the area and protect  the region's rich marine resources."
The statement came as China moved to reaffirm its "indisputable  sovereignty" over the Spratlys, also claimed wholly or in part by Vietnam,  Brunei, the Philippines, Malaysia and Taiwan.
The crux of the dispute over the string of tiny islands centres on the  fact that the area is believed to be rich in resources, particularly oil and  gas, as well as fisheries.
Beijing drew an angry reaction from Vietnam last month when it announced  its intention to proceed with a contract with Colorado-based Crestone Energy  to explore for oil in the Spratlys area.
