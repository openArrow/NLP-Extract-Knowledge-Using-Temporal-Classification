The Dominican Republic's President Joaquin  Balaguer, at 87 seeking his 7th term as president, wrapped up his campaign  Friday with a huge rally that attracted tens of thousands of people.
Waving banners and beating drums, Balaguer's supporters cheered as the  87-year-old, who is nearly blind, pledged in a short but clear speech that if  re-elected, he would struggle "with all my might to maintain economic, social  and political stability."
Balaguer, who has dominated this island of seven million people for  decades, has been most closely challenged by black leader Jose Francisco Pena  Gomez for Monday's vote.
Like Pena Gomez and other contenders, Balaguer has promised to focus his  attention on the poorest in his Caribbean nation, especially access to clean  water, health care and public transport.
Balaguer was first named president by dictator Rafael Trujillo in 1960.  But Trujillo was assassinated a year later after 31 years in power and  Balaguer was removed in a civilian-military uprising in January 1960.
Juan Bosch, another presidential candidate this year, was elected in 1962  but removed in a September 1963 coup. After a failed 1965 coup to return Bosch  to power, Balaguer was re-elected for three consecutive terms (1966-1970;  1970-1974 and 1974-1978). He returned to the presidency in 1986 and was  re-elected again in 1990.
Around 30 people have died in political violence during street protests  and rallies for the May 16 poll. But there have been no deaths this week, and  Balaguer and Pena Gomez have both urged their supporters to refrain from  violence.
Also Friday, about 100 representatives of the Roman Catholic church,  business and union leaders urged all political parties running candidates to  respect the outcome.
They also urged the the electoral officials to quickly give out an  accurate count of the vote.
In addition to a presidential race, there are 30 senate races, 100  deputies and 103 mayors.
