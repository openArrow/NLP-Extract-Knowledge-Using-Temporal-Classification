Japan is to donate 3.82 billion yen (36.7 million  dollars) to China to build an environmental protection centre in Beijing, the  China Daily reported Friday.
The donation, part of a 10.26 billion yen package agreed in 1988, was  signed Thursday, the newspaper said, adding the funds would finance the  construction and the purchase of equipment for a Sino-Japanese Friendship  Environmental Protection Centre.
The donation package will also cover medical care, agriculture, education  and environmental protection projects in landlocked areas of China, as well as  a Sino-Japanese Friendship hospital, and a Sino-Japanese Friendship Exchange  Centre here, it said.
Officials from Japan, China's largest aid donor, said they hoped the  package could help narrow the development gap between this country's booming  coast and backward inland regions.
Japan has given financial assistance worth 1.52 trillion yen to China over  the past 15 years, the newspaper said.
