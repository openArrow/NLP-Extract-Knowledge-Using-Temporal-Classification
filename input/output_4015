Israel on Wednesday ended a 24-hour  closure of Jericho as the autonomous Palestinian area's police chief said he  had instructed his men not to detain armed Jewish settlers.
The Israeli army closed Jericho on Tuesday after Palestinian police  stopped three armed Jewish settlers, took away their arms and held them  briefly before calling in a joint Israeli-Palestinian force and returning  their weapons.
"The Israelis objected that we removed the settlers from the spot they  were in," said Brigadier General Ismail Hassan Jabr, chief of Jericho security  forces.
"We gave strict orders that from now on, our police should only call in  the joint mobile unit and not move the Israelis from their spot nor confiscate  their weapons," he said, referring to a joint patrol unit composed of  Palestinian and Israeli troops.
He added however that his soldiers had taken away the arms of the  settlers, who were buying fruit, because Palestinians around them had started  to protest.
"The Palestinian people here have been under a long, harsh occupation. The  presence of armed settlers is bound to provoke rash reactions," he said.
"I told this many times to the Israelis, they say they understand, but  must stick to the agreement. I think they must be more flexible."
Israel said the closure of Jericho was to give time to the Palestinian  police to read closely the autnomy agreement which stipulates that Israelis  are allowed to carry licensed arms in the autonomous zones.
After re-opening Jericho, the Israeli army said it would only allow  Israelis to drive through a main road in the town center that is patrolled by  the joint forces. It has also asked the Israelis not to leave their cars.
