Suha Tawil, the wife of PLO chief Yasser Arafat has  dismissed rumours she was planning to file for divorce saying the couple could  only be separated by death, the Al-Hayat newspaper reported Thursday.
Speculation that the couple was heading for divorce swept PLO headquarters  in Tunis after Arafat ordered the detention of Tawil's uncle, George Hawa, in  an inquiry into a corruption scandal.
Hawa, a businessman based in London, was released on Wednesday after a  five-day detention, informed sources in Tunis said.
Tawil dismissed reports of his arrest as "unfounded rumours."
"There is no truth also to the rumours that my husband and I are to  divorce (...) Arafat and I are staying together until death," Arafat's wife  told Al-Hayat, which is published in several Arab capitals including Beirut.
