A Taiwan company is to invest 17 million  dollars to set up shrimp farms in northeastern Brazil, more than doubling the  country's shrimp farming industry, the Taiwan company said here Friday.
Sibra International Corporation is to set up farms in the states of  Sergipe, Pernambouc, Paraiba and Rio Grande do Norte covering a total of 5,000  hectares (12,350 acres), more than doubling Brazil's shrimp farm acreage, the  company's managing direcctor Li Ping said.
The company expects to recoup its investment within three years, with  turnover of 250 million dollars and annual production of 10,000 tonnes.
In the longer term Sibra, operating through its Brazilian subsidiary,  hopes to double production working with Brazilian concerns.
"We are ready to transfer technology to the Brazilians. We will give them  the eggs and food and will buy all their production," Ping said.
Sibra is already planning to set up Brazil's most sophisticated shrimp roe  laboratory in Penambouc next month and plans to export 90 percent of its  Brazilian production.
Ping said shrimp farming could transform northeastern Brazil into a rich  area, noting that in Taiwan shrimp farms could produce six tonnes of shrimp  and a profit of 20,000 dollars a year.
But in Brazil profits could be even higher he said because the local  climate would allow three breeding cycles as opposed to the one per year  possible in Taiwan.
Brazil currently produces only about 1,000 tonnes of farm-raised shrimp  per year for sales of five million dollars.
