"I really don't want to believe it has happened," said Nigel Mansell, the  1992 F1 champion. "The situation is dire, not just for Formula One but  motorsports."
Mario Andretti, the 1978 F1 champion, wants track safety studied as well  as greater cockpit protection.
"We should learn something from these tragic accidents," Andretti said.  "When it comes to safety, measures should be redundant. What would it cost for  an extra wall of tires? The other thing is F1 cockpits are much more naked.  The driver's whole neck is exposed. Padding would help with side impact."
"Either of these things might have saved Senna and Ratzenberger," he said.
Fittipaldi stressed that drivers and race organizers must work together to  correct the problems.
"They should sit down around the same table and everyone should give input  on the future of racing. That would be constructive," said Fittipaldi, who  called the week of Senna's funeral one of the toughest in his career.
Scotland's Derrick Walker, an Indy-car team owner and manager, pointed out  that Indy's safety measures came after past tragedies.
"This place has had some crashes and learned from them," Walker said. "All  groups must pick their safety level and look ahead so we don't lose our top  racers, so we don't have the tragedies you see over there now."
