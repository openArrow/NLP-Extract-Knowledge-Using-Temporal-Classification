Elders of a rat-infested village in West Java  eager to rid the area of the paddy-damaging rodents have decreed a 10-day  forced labor punishment for anyone who kills a snake, reports said Thursday.
Head of the Sukajadi village in Tasikmalaya regency, Memed Sumarya, was  quoted by the Kompas daily as saying that the various snakes in the region  were good predators and could help keep the rat population down.
Sumarya said that anyone caught killing a snake will have to labor for 10  days cleaning the village.
He said that for the last three harvest periods, despite various efforts  to eliminate the rat plague, the rodents have seriously damaged half of the  village's 140 hectares (345 acres) of rice fields.
