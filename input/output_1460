After the spectacular failures of his young braves in the crucial  qualifying games against Holland and Norway, Venables' old brigade of Peter  Beardsley, 33, and 31 year-olds, Richardson and Bould, combined maturity with  an unseasonal robustness.
The mercurial Beardsley poached his ninth England goal on his 51st  appearance, nearly four years after his last for his country.
Rob Jones started the move on the right, laying the ball into the path of  Platt, who showed a dash of Italian style, rolling it around his foot before  hitting it along the by-line.
Beardsley was perfectly placed to tuck away the chance from ten yards.
One minute before the break, Shearer raced on to Beardsley's pass and was  tripped by Ioannis Kalitzakis, inside the penalty area.
Platt stepped up to send the goalkeeper the wrong way for his 22nd goal in  47 internationals -- an amazing strike-rate.
The Greeks made three changes for the second-half but their substitutions  made little difference and their attacks lacked penetration.
Their defensive frailities also persisted and in the 55th minute they made  a hopeless mess with the offside trap, the ball running to an unchallenged  Anderton, who shot against goalkeeper Karkamanis.
The ball squirmed free to Shearer, who crossed to the far post where Platt  won a game of head-tennis with the Greek defenders to score his second.
Within three minutes England were 5-0 ahead.
Adams knocked a short pass to Beardsley who looked up and sidefooted the  ball 20-yards into Shearer's stride.
The Blackburn striker turned Karacaidis and thumped his low cross shot  past the diving Karkamanis into the far corner for his first England goal  since November 1992 against Turkey.
England will relish a further chance to pierce the World Cup bubble, when  they face the winners of their qualifying group Norway in the same stadium.
