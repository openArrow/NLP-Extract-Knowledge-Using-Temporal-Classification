The foreign ministers of Russia, the United States  and five western European countries ended a meeting on Bosnia-Hercegovina  Friday with a call for a ceasefire, and negotiations between the warring  parties in two weeks, a French diplomatic source reported.
He said the ministers had called for the ceasefire to be "unconditional."
A communique due to be published later in the evening would reiterate the  ministers' support for a European Union proposal to divide the former Yugoslav  republic on the basis of 51 percent for Moslems and Croats and 49 percent for  Serbs, the source said.
