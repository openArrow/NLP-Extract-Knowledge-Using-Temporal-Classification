spokesman
NAIROBI, May 17 (AFP) - Ghanaian UN troops to be sent back to Rwanda to  end the conflict there must be adequately equipped if they are to carry out  their mission effectively, the spokesman for the UN mission in Rwanda said  Tuesday.
Abdul Kabia, reached by telephone in the Rwandan capital Kigali, said the  Ghanaian battalion of about 800 soldiers "should arrive immediately" and must  have "enough armoured vehicles and effective communications" to be able to  protect the airport and other sectors of the capital.
Kabia added that Kigali was calm Tuesday after sporadic shooting overnight.
His comments came a few hours after the UN Security Council approved the  phased deployment of 5,500 peacekeepers to Rwanda and slapped an arms embargo  on the central African nation, where mass slaughter among the Hutu majority  and the Tutsi minority broke out after the death of president Juvenal  Habyarimana on April 6 in a suspected rocket attack on his plane.
Resolution 918 calls for the immediate deployment of about 150 UN military  observers and a Ghanaian mechanized battalion which had withdrawn to Nairobi  last month after the fighting broke out.
About 330 members of the battalion who stayed behind are in charge of  securing the airport and the city stadium which has been turned into a refugee  camp.
The size of the peacekeeping mission to Rwanda was drastically reduced  from 2,700 to some 300 after UN troops were killed in the bloodletting, which  has claimed some 200,000 lives and forced nearly a million to flee to  neighboring countries.
Fighting was reported Tuesday in various parts of the country including  the northwestern town of Ruhengeri. According to unconfirmed reports, rebel  troops of the Rwandan Patriotic Front have taken control of Bugesera, a small  town south of Kigali and have advanced to Gitarama, southwest of the capital.
