The Japanese government plans to send a mission to  South Africa later this month to assess ways of boosting economic assistance,  a newspaper said Sunday.
The mission will identify areas where Japanese economic aid can be put to  best use, the Sankei Shimbun said.
Japan is expected to pledge large-scale aid at a Group of Seven  industrialized nations' summit in Italy in July, said the paper.
Last year official Japanese assistance to South Africa totalled only 6.6  million dollars.
