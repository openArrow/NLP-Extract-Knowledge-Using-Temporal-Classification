The laying of wreaths by veterans of Nazi  Germany's Waffen SS at the Normandy graves of fallen comrades provoked an  outcry among Allied veterans, who called it "a catastrophe" and "indecent",  reports said Saturday.
Some 15 former Waffen SS men from the 9th and 10th tank regiments laid the  wreaths in two war cemeteries recently in ceremonies attended by the mayors of  Maizet and Esquay Notre-Dame, villages in the Normandy region of Calvados.
The ex-combatants were also asked to sign the visitors' book in both  villages.
One angry French World War II veteran, Leon Gautier, said the mayors  should resign over the incidents "because they should have cancelled the  ceremonies".
British veteran Thomas Parry, who lives in Normandy, deplored the  incident, saying the SS, renowned for their brutality, had been a "race apart".
The Normandy incidents came as France was gearing up to celebrate the 50th  anniverary of D-Day on June 6.
German police meanwhile reported that another Jewish cemetary had been  desecrated in Wurzburg, southern Germany. Authorities were still engaged in a  search of the area for members of a suspected neo-Nazi gang accused of  smashing 13 graves on Wednesday night.
Germany's top Jewish leader, Ignatz Bubis who heads the country's Central  Jewish Council, called on Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government to push for  coordinating European legislation to fight extreme-rightist violence when  Germany assumes the rotating presidency of the European Union in July.
It was unacceptable that Nazi pamphlets were being printed in Denmark and  Spain and then distributed in Germany, which itself outlaws the printing of  such material, Bubis said Friday in a newspaper interview.
He said all European Union nations should adopt the tougher German  legislation as "we cannot stop political violence with national measures."
Bubis called on Germans to demonstrate against racist violence, which  caused the deaths of 22 people last year.
