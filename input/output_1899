An explosion and fire on a Red Sea ferry carrying  almost 600 passengers and crew killed at least three people and left 50  injured on Thursday, rescue services said.
An American warship and a merchant ship had managed to save some  passengers, and there was an unknown number of missing, said the officials in  the Egyptian port of Hurghada.
The Qamar al-Saudi was carrying 583 passengers and crew from Jeddah, Saudi  Arabia, to Suez, in Egypt, when an explosion in the engine room caused a fire  which spread rapidly, the officials said.
Most of those on board were Egyptians returning home for a religious  holiday.
In December 1991 another ferry on the same route, the Salem Express, hit a  coral reef off the Egyptian coast with the loss of 471 people.
