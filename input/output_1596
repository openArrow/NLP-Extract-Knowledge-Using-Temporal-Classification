North Korea has asked India for emergency  supplies of food and medical drugs, a Hong Kong-based weekly magazine reported  Wednesday.
The plea for food aid was made by North Korean leader Kim Il-Sung to the  chief minister of India's West Bengal state, Jyoti Basu, the Far Eastern  Economic Review said in its latest edition.
The report quoted official sources in New Delhi, saying the plea was made  during the 12-day visit to China and North Korea by Basu, who leads India's  last remaining communist government.
Kim is believed to have painted a dire picture of food shortages to Basu  and asked the Bengali communists to organise relief shipments for North Korea  as they did for Cuba two years ago when Fidel Castro's regime was under  pressure.
The report said Basu's apparent agreement to the request was causing  embarrassment in New Delhi, which has tried to prevent India's problems with  Washington over nuclear non-proliferation from becoming entangled with the  US-North Korea row over nuclear weapons.
