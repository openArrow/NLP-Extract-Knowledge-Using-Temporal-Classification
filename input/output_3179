Only a trickle of Nigerians went to register Monday  in elections to a constitutional conference organised by the military regime  amid boycott calls by pro-democracy campaigners, reports across the country  said.
At several polling stations in Lagos, the commercial capital inhabited by  some six million people, nobody at all had registered in the first three hours  after the polls opened, while at others visited by AFP, fewer than a score of  names were recorded.
After registration, the election proper began at noon (1000 GMT), with  voters expected to stand behind the portrait of the candidate of their choice  in a controversial "open ballot" system.
The aim Monday was to choose electoral colleges in each of Nigeria's 30  states and the federal capital territory Abuja, which would in their turn,  next Saturday, elect 273 delegates to the conference, which the regime has  said will chart Nigeria's political future.
Pro-democracy movements, including a powerful group known as Middle Belt  Forum consisting of prominent politicians and other figures in central states,  have dismissed the vote as a "charade" aimed at perpetuating military  dictatorship.
They asked junta leader General Sani Abacha to invite, by May 31, the  presumed winner of presidential elections annulled by the military last year,  tycoon Moshood Abiola, to form a government or face mass protests.
The Campaign for Democracy, a coalition of some 40 pro-democracy and human  rights organisations, has also warned that it would try "physically" to block  the vote and called for a boycott of the conference.
The junta, which plans itself to appoint 96 people to the conference, won  the support at the weekend from a group of traditional chiefs in the ethnic  Yoruba heartland in the southwest, Abiola's home region.
The Yoruba rulers said they would back the government conference in June  on condition that the annullment of last year's presidential poll be part of  the agenda.
Sources reached by AFP in major cities in other parts of the country  reported widespread apathy about the poll.
Apart from the boycott call, however, critics spoke of slipshod  organisation of the poll, with Lagos voters not even knowing until the early  hours of Monday who the candidates were. There was no election campaign.
In most polling stations visited by AFP, there were no pictures of the  candidates to go with their names.
Lagos walls, however, were adorned with posters issued by the recently  formed National Democratic Coalition movement, which read: "Abacha must go  now. Shun the constitutional conference. A popular national government is the  answer."
The previous military regime of General Ibrahim Babangida annulled the  presidential poll of June 12 last year alleging irregularities, although  foreign election monitors had declared the vote free and fair.
Abacha seized power last November after a brief, unelected civilian  interregnum, brought some of Abiola's aides into his team and pledged an end  to military rule, but abolished all of Nigeria's democratic institutions.
He has presented the conference as a key part of the plan to hand over  power. Monday's vote is set to end at 4:00 p.m. (1500 GMT).
