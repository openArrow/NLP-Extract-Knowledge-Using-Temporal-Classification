Graham Gooch and David Ward were double ton kings  on Friday as early-season championship pacesetters Surrey and Essex turned on  the heat.
The 40-year-old Essex captain, a cast-iron certainty to earn a Test recall  this summer, hammered the Kent attack for 236 at Chelmsford as his side piled  up 446 for three, a lead of 255.
Gooch hit 28 four and three sixes in the ninth double century of his  career and shared a county record opening stand of 316 with Paul Prichard, who  compiled a fine 109.
It kept Essex hard on the heels of leaders Surrey, for whom Ward and  Graham Thrope plundered the weakened Derbyshire attack for 301 in a rampaging  third wicket stand.
Ward achieved the double ton for the third time in his career and was  unbeaten on 216, having hit five sixes and 23 fours, out of his side's 373 for  five, a lead of 165 after Surrey had bowled out the visitors for 208.
Thorpe, dropped on 18, made a patient 114 with 17 fours after Derbyshire,  without flu victim Devon Malcolm and with Ole Mortensen (hamstring), Dominic  Cork (knee) and Phil DeFreitas (sore toe) all sidelined.
England chairman of selectors Ray Ilingworth saw Leicestershire paceman  David Millns take four for 62 as the home side bowled out Somesrset for 288 at  Grace Road. Peter Hepworth and Ben Smith hit half centuries to help  Leicestershire to 236 for four in reply.
Paul Johnson, another England hopeful, staked his claim with 101 for  Nottinghamshire against Durham at Trent Bridge.
He shared in a fourth wicket stand of 125 with West Indies all rounder  Jimmy Adams (60) but Notts wasted their good work by losing their last five  wickets for just 18 runs and were all out for 278, a lead of 43.
David Graveney bagged six for 80, his best figures for Durham, who knocked  off the arrears in closing at 58 for one.
Martin Speight rescued Sussex against Hampshire at Hove with a timely 126  - his first championship century of the season.
Speight, who took 35 minutes to score his first run, struck five sixes and  16 fours from 147 balls. His second 50 came off only 28 deliveries.
He and England leg-spinner Ian Salisbury (49) put on 151 for the seventh  wicket after Sussex slumped to 73 for six, chasing Hampshire's 267.
The home side were finally dismissed for 279 and Hampshire replied with 44  for one.
Richard Stemp's left-arm spin put Yorkshire in command at Cardiff, where  Glamorgan slumped 158 for eight, 32 runs short of saving the follow-on.
Stemp was on the brink of a career-best, having taken five for 41 from 23  overs and needing one further wicket at a low cost tomorrow.
Yorkshire had finished with a creditable 339 after Richard Blakey (87)  and Darren Gough (54) led a recovery.
Gloucestershire captain Courtney Walsh kept Worcestershire in the field  for nearly 10 hours and then added to their misery by taking two for 25 before  the close at New Road.
The double dismissal of openers Tim Curtis and Philip Weston - both leg  before - justified Walsh's tactics in letting his side's first innings dawdle  to 390 in 152.1 overs.
Worcestershire, set of 241 to avoid the follow on, struggled to 51 for two  off 18 overs.
