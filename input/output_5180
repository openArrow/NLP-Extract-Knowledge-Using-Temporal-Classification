The self-declared Bosnian Croat parliament has  given qualified backing to an accord providing for a Moslem-Croat federation  in Bosnia, the Croatian news agency Hina said Sunday.
At a meeting Saturday in the southern Bosnian city of Mostar, the  parliament endorsed the federation plan as an "historic necessity" dictated by  "internal and foreign policy realities."
But it made its backing subject to the Croats in Bosnia being afforded  equal rights and the federation being liked in a confederation with Croatia.
Croatian Defence Minister Gojko Susak, who attended the assembly's debate,  said "without a confederation, there can be no federation."
The meeting came ahead of a session in Sarajevo on Monday of a constituent  assembly die to to elect a Croat president, a Moslem vice-president and a  Moslem prime minister for the federation in accordance with an agreement  reached May 11 in Vienna.
Under the latest international peace plan for Bosnia, the federation is to  cover 51 percent of Bosnian territory. The Moslems and Croats have said they  want 58 perccent. The Bosnian Serbs currently hold 70 percent.
The Vienna accord foresees the creation of four Moslem, two Croat and two  mixed cantons. The mixed areas in central and southern regions of the country   will be jointly administered, but this has upset local Croats, especially in   Mostar. Croat inhabitants complain the canton including Mostar includes the  Catholic pilgrimage site of Medjugorje.
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has said Mostar should underline its  Croat identity. "Mostar should be the home of the main Croat institutions. It  should have a Croat university, a Croat theatre, a Croat fotball club."
The Croats also want to keep their Croatian currency, the kuna, in Bosnia  as added evidence of their ethnic identity.
The federation accord provides for a Bosnian federation currency under  central government control.
