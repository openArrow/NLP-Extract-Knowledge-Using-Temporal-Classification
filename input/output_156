Benetton picked up their second Formula One team on  Friday, when manager Flavio Briatore took control of French strugglers Ligier.
Briatore, backed by the Italian clothing giant, had been angling for  months to get hold of the team's Renault V-10 engine, which has powered  Williams to two consecutive driver and constructor world titles.
Ligier's entrepreneur owner Cyril de Rouvre, who had bought the team from  Guy Ligier in late 1992, was forced to sell after becoming the subject of a  fraud investigation last December.
A statement, issued by Ligier's sponsors here for the Monaco Grand Prix,  said that of several offers received: "Flavio Briatore's plan seemed the best  solution, one will enable Ligier to make up lost ground technologically, get  back to a competitive level and thereby ensure its future.
"Benetton-Ford's results in the 1994 world championship, its technical  reputation, notably in the area of aerodynamics and suspension, were a  deciding factor in the choice."
Benetton Ford driver Michael Schumacher has won all three Grands Prix this  season.
Briatore, whose Benetton-Ford team is based in Britain, is expected to  outline his plans for Ligier on Saturday evening.
