The Ukrainian parliament Monday postponed for 24  hours a debate, scheduled for Tuesday, on its conflict with the separatist  republic of Crimea.
The breakaway republic last month passed a separatist constitution, whose  suspension Kiev has demanded. But Crimean authorities had not responded by  Monday afternoon to a Ukrainian ultimatum, due to expire Tuesday, to back down.
"We have to avoid a confrontation. We must not aggravate relations between  the parliament of Crimea and of Ukraine," Ukrainian parliamentary speaker  Alexandre Moroz stressed at a press conference.
Moroz rejected the idea, being pushed in some sections of the Russian  media, of direct presidential rule being imposed on Crimea, saying there was  "no reason to impose it."
"I think the negotiations will come to a conclusion and the Crimean  constitution will be abolished," Moroz stated.
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, who was initially to have come  forward Tuesday with a package of measures to crush the secessionist push in  Crimea, meanwhile put back his own intervention until Wednesday.
Parliamentary press service sources said the Kiev assembly was next due to  examine the composition of Crimea's new government, while a parliamentary  delegation under communist deputy Boris Olenik was set to go to Crimea at the  end of the week.
In Simferopol, Igor Azarov, a spokesman for vice parliamentary speaker  Viktor Mejak, said the assembly was awaiting negotiations prior to debating  whether to suspend the separatist constitution.
