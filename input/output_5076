The foreign office here on Sunday said the expulsion of Maguire, who won  the Nobel prize in 1976, and fellow Irish activist Tom Hyland, "was taken  solely to prevent non-Filipinos from making use of Philippine soil to seek to  undermine the territorial integrity of a friendly neighboring state."
Hyland is the coordinator of the Dublin-based East Timor Ireland  Solidarity Campaign, and Maguire is one of its patrons along with black South  African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, another Nobel Peace prize laureate.
Their expulsion did not reflect the Philippine view of its relationship  with Ireland or "diminish respect" Manila has for their efforts in bringing  peace to the Irish people, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said in a  statement.
DFA said the two would have been welcome if they were here "to lend their  wisdom in peacemaking" to help solve the Philippines' own conflicts, which  include a communist insurgency and a Moslem rebellion.
