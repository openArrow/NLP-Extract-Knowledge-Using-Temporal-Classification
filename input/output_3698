Benson and Hedges Cup holders Derbyshire saw their  hopes of retaining the title dashed by Worcestershire bowler Stuart Lampitt on  Tuesday.
Lampitt set up a nine-wicket win at Derby by taking six for 16 in a  30-ball spell to humiliate the home side.
His final figurs of six for 26 sent Derbyshire spiralling to 98 all out,  virtually settling the match before it had even begun.
Drizzle delayed the start to 2pm, but by 6.30pm it was all over as  Worcestershire's batsmen completed the kill in only 18.2 overs against some  dreadful Derbyshire bowling.
Former England strike bowler Phil DeFreitas did nothing to earn a Test  recall by producing an appalling spell. His second and third overs cost 21  runs, including four no balls.
Tim Curtis, caught at long leg off a no-ball from Devon Malcolm, put on 93  with Graeme Hick to seal the game.
Worcestershire's other bowling hero on the seaming pitch was Australian  Tom Moody, who took 3-14 in 11 overs of gentle medium pace, the ball moving  both ways.
Derbyshire's sad score was their lowest total in the Benson and Hedges  competition.
