French champions Paris Saint Germain snapped up  Cannes manager Luis Fernandez on a two-year deal here on Monday.
Fernandez, a former Paris Saint Germain captain and French international  midfielder, replaces Artur Jorge, ditched with a year of his contract to run  despite winning the French title and reaching the European Cup Winners' Cup  semi-finals.
Jorge was continually criticised for producing a boring, safety-first  playing style and responded by refusing to speak to the media.
Fernandez, ironically, was the Paris Saint Germain skipper when the team  won its first championship in 1986.
He played in France's European Championship winning side in 1984, acting  as Michel Platini's workhorse. He joined Cannes as manager in 1993.
Jorge is set to return to his native Portugal where he is being touted to  take over as national coach.
