The House of Representatives voted Thursday to  give an ultimatum to Western Europe to pay a larger share of US defense costs  on the continent or face further reduction of US troops.
The measure was approved 268-144, in defiance of the White House, as an  amendment to a proposed 262.7 billion dollar defense spending bill, which  remained subject to debate.
"The United States continues to be the world's policeman," said  Representative Jim Ramstad of Minnesota. "We simply can't afford it."
The measure directs the president to press US allies in Europe to pay up  to 75 percent of the non-salary costs of maintaining troops in Europe. For  every percentage point below 75 percent, the United States would withdraw  1,000 troops.
"There is no reason for the American taxpayers, in the face of our own  substantial deficit, to continue to subsidize Germany, France, England,  Norway, Belgium and other prosperous European democracies," said  Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, sponsor of the amendment.
Supporters of the measure said the allies now pay only five percent of  non-salary costs and said the amendment could lead to savings of five billion  dollars over five years.
Salary costs were excluded from the language to avoid giving the  impression US troops were serving as mercenaries, backers said.
The administration of President Bill Clinton opposed the measure, saying  the European allies cannot afford to increase contributions without cutting  their own defense budgets.
Defense Secretary William Perry said in a report to Congress that demands  for more cost-sharing would require Washington "to expend an inordinate amount  of political capital in a win-lose confrontation."
Representative Earl Hutto, an opponent of the amendment, said "This  amendment would become little more than a troop reduction plan. Our presence  overseas provides an important calming influence for which there is no  substitute."
