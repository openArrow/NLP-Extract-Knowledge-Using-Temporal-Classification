Laudelino Cubino upstaged compatriot Miguel  Indurain by claiming Spain's first stage win in the Tour of Italy here on  Saturday.
Russian Evgeni Berzin retained his overall lead after losing ten seconds  to the leading group of six riders.
Indurain, the pre-race favourite who has yet to feature at the head of the  Giro, gets his chance to put that right in Sunday's 44km time trial.
Cubino had broken clear on his own with 25km to go but his chances looked  over when he was caught by the peloton with just 3km to go.
But sprinter Italian Michele Coppolillo, who finished second, and  third-placed Fabian Jeker of Switzerland were so busy watching each other that  Cubion stole the stage on the line.
