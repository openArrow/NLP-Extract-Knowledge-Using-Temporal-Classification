The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) fronting the  armed insurgency against Turkish authorities is on the point of breaking up  after a series of military defeats, Interior Minister Nahit Mentese said here  Sunday.
Mentese said in a statement that the PKK "has lost its options for  logistical support and suffered major losses following large-scale operations  by the army."
He added: "The process of dissolution of the separatistist organisation  has begun."
Since May 1, Mentese said, 314 PKK militants had been arrested and 186  killed, and 48 others including senior commanders had surrended to security  forces in the Kurdish strongholds of east and southeast Turkey, where the PKK  is fighting for an independent state.
He repeated earlier government pledges that the PKK would be eliminated by  the end of the year, urging militants to give themselves up to benefit from  sentence reductions offered to Kurdish activists who have taken no part in the  armed struggle.
Separately, authorities in Diyarbakir, the headquarters of the  government's military operation against the insurgents, said Sunday that 16  Kurdish rebels were killed Saturday in clashes with government forces in  southeast Turkey.
The deaths raised to 31 the number of Kurdish fighters killed since Friday.
Earlier Sunday in Zakho, Iraq, aid organisations said thousands of Kurds  had fled repression in Turkey and crossed the mountains into neighbouring Iraq.
Some 4,200 Turkish Kurds have crossed the border into northern Iraq since  the beginning of March, with most having crossed in the past four weeks, said  Hannes Kempman from the German aid association HAD.
Since the Turkish Kurd insurgency was launched in August 1984, more than  11,000 rebels, police, troops and civilians have been killed.
