Switzerland's Tony Rominger created history here on  Sunday by clinching a hat-trick of Tour of Spain triumphs.
The 1992 and 1993 winner also gave world number one Miguel Indurain the  perfect reminder that this year's Tour de France will be a major confrontation  between the two.
The 165km 21st and final stage between Palazuelos and Madrid was won in a  sprint finish by Frenchman Laurent Jalabert.
Rominger led the event from the first day after winning the opening time  trial. Spaniards Mikel Zarrabeitia and Pedro Delgado came third overall.
It was Jalabert's seventh stage win of the race.
