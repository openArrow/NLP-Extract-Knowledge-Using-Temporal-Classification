Angolan state radio also announced Tuesday that more than 125 people have  been killed and 300 wounded in six days of fighting in Kuito, which was  continuing on Tuesday.
Both sides had deployed artillery batteries in the streets of the town,  divided between government troops and UNITA, the radio said.
A spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) called  for the creation of "neutral zones" in Kuito to bring medical and food aid to  civilians, in a broadcast on the commercial LAC radio.
Official radio added that an unknown number of civilians had fled their  villages near Luena in the eastern Moxico province, where fighting has been  under way since Monday.
The army said nine UNITA soldiers were killed about 30 kilometres (19  miles) from Luena, but the radio gave no other details.
