Boris Becker earned a free ride into the Italian Open  semi-finals here on Friday, when fellow German Michael Stich pulled out before  their quarter-final with back pains.
Stich, the world number two, had complained of "a cold in the back" after  Thursday's third-round victory over Moroccan surprise qualifier, Karim Alami.
On Friday, a report from tournament doctors said Stich was suffering from  "pain in the lower lumbar region and in both legs, with consequent loss of  muscle strength." They prescribed muscle relaxants and pain killers.
Becker and Stich have only met on clay once, two years ago in the  semi-finals at Hamburg, when Stich thrashed his compatriot 6-1, 6-1.
The semi-final was Becker's top career showing on clay, his least  favourite surface, although the three-times Wimbledon champion still has an  all-surface career record of 5-3 over Stich.
Becker has also won their last two matches -- at Wimbledon last year and  Stuttgart in February.
World number Pete Sampras was playing Italian Andrea Gaudenzi in the day's  opening match at the Foro Italico, basking in warm spring sunshine.
Gaudenzi advanced from the third round through injury to Austrian sparring  partner and seventh seed Thomas Muster, who also withdrew with back pains  during their first set while trailing 4-1.
Sampras has been through a solid tune-up this week during his first outing  on clay this year. The 22-year-old American is aiming for a long-shot victory  at the French Open, which would give him four Grand Slam titles in a row.
Goran Ivanisevic, who knocked out fellow big-server Richard Krajicek of  the Netherlands on Thursday, will take on another Dutchman, Jacco Eltingh, for  a place in the semis.
Second seeded American Jim Courier was to play Slava Doesdel of the Czech  Republic.
