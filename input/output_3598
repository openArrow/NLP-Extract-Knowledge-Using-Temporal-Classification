North Korea's refusal to allow inspections of its  nuclear power stations, and its arms exports to unstable countries, poses a  "grave risk" to world peace, NATO said here Tuesday.
In a statement issued after their latest twice-yearly meeting, defence  ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation pledged to support all  efforts aimed at defusing North Korea's nuclear threat.
The statement criticised North Korea's failure to meet the terms of the  Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and its "recurring threats" to withdraw from  the treaty altogether.
It said that this, plus North Korea's "history of exporting ballistic  missiles and weapons technology to regions of instability," presented the  world with a "serious, unprecedented problem."
The NATO meeting also stressed the need to maintain control over the  nuclear arsenal of countries of the former Soviet Union.
"Any loss of control could pose a very serious risk to the alliance's  security," the statement said.
