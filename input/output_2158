Venezuelan Energy Minister Erwin  Arrieta-Valera called here Thursday for OPEC countries to be less  confrontational and to foster better relations with consumer countries.
He backed the recent decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting  Countries (OPEC) to maintain production quotas in 1994, and to distribute any  necessary cuts proportionally across OPEC members.
But he told the Arab Times in an interview: "It is time to review the  behaviour of OPEC and to go back to its original principles.
"The founders did not think of forming a cartel but of regulating the flow  of this strategic material from the producer to the consumer.
"We became a cartel in the 1970s and now we are suffering from that  mistake."
Some OPEC actions had led to tensions and conflicts with industrialised  oil importing countries, he said.
"Energy should be used to benefit everybody, not for a cause or  confrontation."
He added he thought prices would rise moderately as a whole in 1994 to  reach an average of 14 to 15 dollars a barrel over the year.
And called for cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers to keep  prices stable, saying he thought prices would fall in the summer in line with  a drop in demand.
"OPEC will use this time until the end of 1994 to study the total volume  which should be pumped into the world market."
