Japanese corporate profits are expected to edge  upward by an average of 6.2 percent in the current year to March 1995  following a four-year slump, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said Saturday.
According to the newspaper, 1,473 major companies excluding financial  institutions forecast higher pre-tax profits of a total 6.952 trillion yen (67  billion dollars) following a 16.6 percent fall in the year to March.
Revenue is also forecast to increase 0.5 percent this year to 322.34  trillion yen after falling five percent the previous year.
The newspaper attributed the bright forecast to progress of their  restructuring programs and swift recovery in the US economy.
In the manufacturing sector, companies projected earnings to jump 18.2  percent this year to 3.549 trillion yen on sales gaining by 1.6 percent to  119.84 trillion yen.
The Nihon Keizai said electronics companies forecast higher profits on  continued expansion of the Asian and the US markets. But the newspaper warned  the pace of overall recovery was to be slow on concern of a higher yen.
In the non-manufacturing sector, companies forecast lower profits of 3.404  trillion yen this year, down four percent. Revenue is projected to fall 0.1  percent to 202.5 trillion yen.
