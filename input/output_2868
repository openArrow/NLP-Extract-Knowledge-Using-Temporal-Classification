Israel's abduction of the pro-Iranian querrilla  chief Mustafa Diran in Lebanon was a "terrorist act," Iranian state radio said  Sunday.
In a commentary, the radio called on the international community to  condemn the kidnapping, showed the "weakness" of the Israelis.
Dirani, 46, was abducted by Israeli commandos in a pre-dawn raid Saturday  on his home in the village of Qsarnabaa in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley  in eastern Lebanon.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the kidnapping was undertaken to gain  information about missing Israeli airman Ron Arad, whose plane was shot down  over south Lebanon in 1986 during an Israeli bombing raid of a Palestinian  refugee camp.
Israel is hoping Dirani will confirm reports that Arad is still alive an  being held by Iranian revolutionary guards, acharge which Iran has strongly  denied.
The radio did not mention Arad.
