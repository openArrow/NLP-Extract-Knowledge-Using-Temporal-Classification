US and Japanese negotiators will meet here  Thursday to discuss the trade dispute which has soured relations between the  world's two largest economic powers, a White House official said Monday.
Earlier talks broke down in February when then Japanese prime minister  Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton failed to see eye-to-eye at a  White House summit meeting.
