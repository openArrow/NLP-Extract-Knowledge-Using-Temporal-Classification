In Dirani's home village of Qsarnabaa, from where he was abducted, another  leader of the Resistance of the Faithful told reporters that his colleague had  no information on Arad.
Since Dirani left the Syrian-backed group Amal in 1988, "he has had no  further involvement in this affair and has absolutely no information on this  subject," insisted Zakariya Hamzeh.
Hamzeh also issued a threat of revenge against Israel. The Resistance of  the Faithful "will not allow Israel to laugh for long," Hamzeh warned, without  elaborating.
Dirani was head of intelligence for Amal when the group captured Arad.
