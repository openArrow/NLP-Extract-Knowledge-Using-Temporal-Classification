Despite his high ranking, the volatile Croatian is still struggling to  recapture form. He failed to win a match at both Madrid and Hamburg and  although he reached the quarter-finals at Monte Carlo and Rome, he was  severely beaten in both events -- first by Bruguera and then by Becker.
Strengths: Service
Weaknesses: Himself and surface
MICHAEL CHANG (France x8)
Youngest-ever winner of the French Open in 1989 at the age of 17 yrs 3  months, Chang is always dangerous at Roland Garros. Winner of four titles so  far in 1994 after triumphing at Jakarta, Philadelphia, Hong Kong and Atlanta,  Chang slipped up when beaten by Dutchman Jacco Eltingh in the second-round of  the Italian Open.
Strengths: Speed around court
Weaknesses: Lacks of power
BORIS BECKER (Germany x10)
Desperately in need of success after a bitterly disappointing 1993, a  slimmed-down Becker joined forces with Nick Bollettieri and started the year  by winning Milan and then by reaching the semi-finals at Stuttgart. The  26-year-old German's next successes came when he reached the semi-finals at  Tokyo and, more significantly, the final at Rome. The 6ft 3in, three-times  Wimbledon champion, who became the father of Noah in January, will be making  his ninth appearance at Roland Garros where he was semi-finalist three times  -- in 1987, 1989 and 1991.
Strengths: Determination and experience
Weaknesses: A style unsuited to clay
THOMAS MUSTER (Austria x11)
A slow-court specialist willing to spend all the time it takes slogging it  out from the baseline. The 26-year-old Austrian won both the Mexico and Madrid  tournaments this year and will be making his ninth appearance at Roland Garros  where he was a semi-finalist five years ago.
Strengths: Stamina and discipline
Weaknesses: Lack of innovation
