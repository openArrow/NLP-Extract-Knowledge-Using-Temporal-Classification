German M3 money supply grew by a year-on-year  15.8 percent during April, well above the Bundesbank's target of four to six  percent for 1994, according to provisional figures from the German central  bank Tuesday.
M3 grew by an annualised 15.4 per cent in March, 17.5 percent in February  and 21.2 percent in January.
The Bundesbank stressed in a statement that money supply "grew strongly in  April" due in part to the bank's paying over in that month of practically the  whole of the central bank's 1993 profits to the state.
It said the April figure was still much influenced by the expansion in  German M3 around the end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994, which the bank  said was due to exceptional factors.
The April figure was also due to uncertainty on world markets, the bank  said, expressing the hope that recent German interest rate cuts would ease a  liquidity bottleneck.
Economists partly explain the continuing high rate of M3 growth by the  movement back into Germany of Luxembourgeois investment funds, which have gone  into short-term deposits while awaiting a calming of the bond market.
With a hoped-for move now into relatively more attractive longer-term  deposits after the latest Bundesbank rate cuts, these funds would no longer  compose part of the M3 measurement.
M3 comprises money in circulation, sight deposits and term and savings  deposits of less than four years.
