"Life goes on... I guess, "said Sampras, adding: "But I still think I can  win here one day. In fact I'm sure of that. Each year I'm getting better on  clay."
"Looking back over today's match -- I felt I had my chances. I had the  shots to come in on, but I didn't do it. If I could play it over again I would  probably serve and volley more."
"The bottom line is winning the big points -- and I didn't win too many of  them today.
Asked about his failure to complete the feat of a fourth consecutive Grand  Slam win, Sampras shook his head sadly: "I don't know what to think right now.  I feel very down and disappointed.
"To win four in a row would have been something that would have been  written about for a long time to come.
"I don't think there was anything wrong with my preparation for this  tournament and I'll probably play the same schedule again next year.
