The European Court of Justice Thursday  condemned Ireland for allowing a child to be placed for adoption in defiance  of her natural father.
The nine judges unanimously ruled that Ireland contravened the European  convention on human rights and sentenced Dublin to nearly 55,000 punts (some  80,000 dollars) in interest and damages.
The case arises out of a decision by local authorities in Ireland to place  a baby girl into care after her mother asked for her to be adopted in 1988.
Joseph Keegan, the natural father, asked the girl be placed into his own  care, but his demands were finally rejected in February 1990 on the grounds  that the baby girl had grown attached to her adoptive family.
The European Court of Justice found that Irish legislation had not allowed  Keegan to take up the matter with the adoption services, had forced him to  resort to court action and that time taken up by litigation had tipped the  balance in favour of the adoptive family.
A state should act in such a way as to allow family ties to develop, the  court also said.
