Olympique Marseille's future was placed  in the hands of an examining magistrate by a commercial court here Tuesday  after it heard the club had debts of 404 million francs (70 million dollars).
Accounts for the 1992-93 season showed debts of 404 million francs and  operating losses of 123 million francs (22 million dollars) which left a net  deficit of 67 million francs (12 million dollars).
Club president Bernard Tapie claims the debts can be covered by the sale  of players and he can personally guarantee the 67 million francs. Tapie has  appealed against his life ban from the sport for his alleged part in a  match-fixing scandal which led to Marseille being demoted to the second  division.
Bernard Nouaille has been appointed to check the club's accounts. If he  reports the club is in cessation of payments it will be wound up.
The French league's financial watchdog, the DNCG, was to rule by the end  of the month on whether Marseille could sign any new players for next season.
Brazilian forward Sonny Anderson da Silva, on loan from Servette Geneva,  will almost certainly leave Marseille, the Swiss champions said.
Juventus of Italy have already bid 10 million dollars and French clubs  Monaco and Bordeaux are also interested.
