Australian minerals producer MIM Holdings Ltd.  announced Wednesday it had completed the sale of a 24.2 percent stake in  metals trader Metallgesellschaft Ltd. to German parent Metallgesellschaft AG  (MG).
MIM managing director and chief executive Norm Fussell said the commany  had retained a 9.1 percent interest in the London Metal Exchange member.
The sale of the trader was part of an asset swap between MIM and MG that  included a restructuring of the companies' German smelting interests.
MIM would now wholly own MHD "Berzelius" Duisburg GmbH lead and zinc  smelter-refinery and MG, through its unit Rheinische Zinkgesellschaft mbH, now  held 100 percent of zinc refiner and manufacturer Ruhr-Zink GmbH.
Previously, both MIM and MG, held 50 percent stakes in each business.
On Monday, MIM announced it had sold its 3.5 per cent stake in MG itself.
The holding in the German metal producer was valued at 85 million  Australian dollars (61 million US) last year but Myers said MIM's sale had  realised only 62 million dollars after being sold over a four-month period at  varying exchange rates.
"There has obviously been a loss but this is being taken up by provisions  made over the last year," Myers said.
MIM shares closed at 3.27 dollars each, six cents below their finishing  level on Tuesday.
