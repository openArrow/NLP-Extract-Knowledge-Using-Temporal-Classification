A Japanese court on Monday ordered Tokyo Electric  Power Co. Inc. to pay 106.6 million yen (one million dollars) in lost wages  and compensation to 13 employees who suffered discrimination because of their  political beliefs.
The Chiba District Court upheld the plaintiffs' claims, ruling that Tokyo  Electric Power, the world's biggest private electric power company,  discriminated against the employees for wages and promotions because they were  members or supporters of the Japan Communist Party.
The verdict came 18 years after the plaintiffs in Chiba Prefecture, east  of Tokyo, filed a suit against the company, seeking 360 million yen in  compensation and wage differences.
Monday's decision is the fourth ruling on a lawsuit against Tokyo Electric  Power, following those in three other district courts. In each case, the firm  has appealed the rulings.
Discrimination lawsuits against the power company were filed in 1976 by  165 company employees in Tokyo and five other prefectures, including Chiba.
