Nine officials of Pakistan's central bank have  been suspended for negligence in connection with a multi-million dollar  banking scandal, a source said Saturday.
A senior executive of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), speaking on  condition of anonymity, said the action had been taken following an  investigation.
The scandal surfaced when former chief executive of local private bank,  Mehran Bank Limited (MBL), was arrested for allegedly embezzling more than 36  million dollars on Foreign Exchange Bearer Certificates issued by SBP.
The jailed banker, Younus Habib, has also been accused by the government  of misappropriating tens of millions of rupees since the bank's establishment  in 1991 and doling out large sums to politicians and a former army chief.
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has said a judicial probe would be conducted  into the scam.
