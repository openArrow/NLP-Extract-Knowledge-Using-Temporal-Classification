The dollar fell against other major currencies  except the yen here early Tuesday in a quiet market after the long Memorial  Day holiday weekend.
Gold, meanwhile, rose to 387.40 dollars an ounce, up 2.70 dollars from  late Friday.
At about 9:30 a.m. (1330 GMT), the dollar traded at 1.6405 German marks,  unchanged from midday in London and down from 1.6432 marks late Friday in New  York.
Against the yen, it was quoted at 104.45, down from 104.55 in London but  up from 104.22 Friday in New York.
The greenback fell to 5.6110 French francs from 5.6158 late Friday, to  1.3985 Swiss francs (1.4020) and to 0.6614 pound sterling (0.6620).
A trader with a European bank here said the dollar was expected to trade  within a narrow band until the publication Friday of US May unemployment  figures.
Most experts predicted the jobless rate remained unchanged at 6.4 percent  and the economy created 285,000 jobs.
The dollar was expected to fluctuate between 1.6385 and 1.6450 marks for  the rest of the day.
Climbing bond interest rates were holding back the dollar, the trader said.
Interest rates on the main 30-year Treasury bond averaged 7.44 percent, up  from 7.39 percent late Friday.
