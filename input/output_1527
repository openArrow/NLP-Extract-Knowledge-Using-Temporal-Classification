The Indian government has handed out approvals  for the first companies seeking to tap overseas capital markets following the  failure of a billion-dollar float by the overseas telecom monopoly.
Truck manufacturer Tata Engineering, scooter maker Bajaj Auto and J.K.  Synthetics are among the companies given the green signal, The Economic Times  reported Wednesday.
Tata Engineering proposes to raise 300 million dollars, Bajaj Auto 160  million dollars and J.K. Synthetics 100 million dollars through Euroissues.
The reported go-ahead for their proposals marks the lifting of a freeze on  Indian companies wishing to sell equity in foreign markets to fund expansion  projects.
The three corporations would be the first to make an overseas foray since  this month's failure of a billion-dollar venture by the Videsh Sanchar Nigam  Ltd. (VSNL, Overseas Telecommunications Service).
Poor response from overseas investors forced VSNL to withdraw the issue,  which critics said had been too ambitious. Some analysts attributed the  failure to uncertainty over the end-use of funds that VSNL would have raised.
On May 11, the finance ministry announced rules for Euroissues, saying  overseas money should be used up within a year and for five purposes -- to  import capital goods, set up new plants, buy equipment and real estate, repay  foreign debt and invest abroad.
Companies will be required to submit quarterly statements certified by  their auditors that the funds have not gone towards any other purpose, such as  retiring high-cost domestic debt and for short-term gains like playing the  stock market.
