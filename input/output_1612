Graffiti by American, British and German  soldiers during World War II are displayed at an exhibition in a Normandy town  to coincide with 50th anniversary ceremonies next month marking the allied  D-Day landings.
The exhibition, organised by the Normandy association "friends of  graffiti" contains pictures of the drawings carved in stone or chalked on the  walls of local houses or churches.
While many soldiers only recorded their names and units and the date,  others were more ambitious leaving behind such graffiti as a British Spitfire  or a naked woman on a barn.
"This exhibition aims to bring back the past of those anonymous soldiers  who 50 years ago wanted to leave something of themselves behind," said  organiser Jacqueline Wurmlinger.
The exhibition runs throughout the summer at a chapel in  Banneville-sur-Ajon, southwest of Caen.
