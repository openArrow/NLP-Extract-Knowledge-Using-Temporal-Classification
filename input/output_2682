Italian prosecutors demanded Saturday that  Senator Giulio Andreotti, the seven-time Christian Democrat prime minister, be  indicted on charges of collusion with organized crime.
The Palermo prosecutors office made its request to local judges after an  investigation launched in March 1992 into Andreotti's alleged links to the  Mafia.
Andreotti, 72, is a senator for life, but had his parliamentary immunity  lifted in June last year.
Andreotti, who served as a government minister 33 times in nearly 50 years  of political life, has denied accusations which came from former Mafia members  that he was a protector of top crime figures for nearly 15 years and may have  ordered two mob killings.
