A Bosnian grenade-launcher and anti-tank  missile were found on Sardinia, police said Tuesday, fueling fears of some  sort of mysterious network between the Mediterranean island and ex-Yugoslav  states.
The 64 mm grenade launching tube and an anti-tank missile, in perfect  working order and packed inside a Plexiglas container, were found hidden at a  rocky site near the town of Macomer in central Sardinia.
Their discovery followed another recent find on Sardinia of submachine  guns made in ex-Yugoslavia, officials said.
Investigators said they have not ruled out some sort of link between  Sardinia and elements in war-torn former Yugoslav states, but its goals were  unclear.
Powerful weapons from ex-Yugoslav war zones have been found in other  Italian regions over the last two years since war broke out after the break-up  of the old Yugoslav federation, notably in Calabria and Puglia in the south  and the island of Sicily. Italy lies just across the Adriatic from Croatia and  Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Sardinian gansters who oppose Rome's central hold over Italian affairs  have launched dynamite attacks in recent years against symbols of state  authority, including police stations and military barracks.
They have also staged kidnappings of local officials to demand ransoms.
