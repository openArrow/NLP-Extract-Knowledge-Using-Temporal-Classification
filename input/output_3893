A Polish court prosecutor Wednesday called for  15-year jail terms for two former communist generals accused of plotting the  1984 murder of Jerzy Popielusko, a priest associated with the then underground  Solidarity trade union.
Former deputy interior minister responsible for the political police,  Wladyslaw Ciaston, and the former head of the interior ministry department  responsible for the clergy, Zenon Platek, have been on trial here for the past  two years in connection with the assassination.
Both men, who are free on bail, have pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Former conservative premier Jan Olszewski, who testified at the trial  Monday, described the killing as "a premeditated murder, carefully prepared."
Olszewski, a lawyer who represented three police officers tried in 1985  for the killing, said the murder aimed to "destabilize" Poland and "serve the  interests" of factions within the communist party and the interior ministry.
The three policemen directly implicated in the murder, Captain Grzegorz  Piotrowski and lieutenants Leszek Pekala and Waldemar Chmielewski, were  sentenced respectively to 25 years, 15 years and 14 years in prison.
Their chief, Colonel Adam Pietruszka, was sentenced to 25 years in jail.
