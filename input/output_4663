Share prices rallied by 2.29 percent here on Friday  following a recovery of 3.67 percent on Thursday.
The market had fallen at the beginning of the week by 2.8 percent on  Monday, by 3.7 percent on Tuesday and 5.5 percent on Wednesday.
The fall of stocks prices followed, and was seen by dealers as being  linked to, pressure against the drachma last week.
Trading in the drachma was calm on Friday. The drachma was quoted at 149  to the mark compared to 150.07 on Thursday and at 245.7 to the dollar against  246.4.
The Bank of Greece eased short-term rates to provide liquidity to the  strangled market. But the overnight interbank rate was 130-150 percent from up  to 200 percent on Thursday, the chief foreign exchange dealer at Citibank  Yorgos Kontoyannis said.
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said late on Thursday that "the battle  of the drachma is continuing, it is crucial but it has been won".
The problem of high rates should be solved "within one or two weeks", he  said.
But banking circles said that "the battle is not yet over".
