Iraq on Thursday denied US charges that it had  used chemical or biological weapons in the 1991 Gulf war, saying the "Jewish  lobby in Washington" was behind the allegations.
An official spokesman quoted by the state-run Iraqi news agency INA  accused "American circles and the Jewish lobby in Washington of deceiving the  Congress and hiding the real causes of the mysterious ailment" afflicting tens  of thousands of US veterans of the war.
"Pressure groups in the Congress are trying to exploit this ailment for  political ends hostile to Iraq," according to the spokesman quoted by INA,  which was monitored in Cyprus.
He said the ailment was caused by "weapons containing depleted uranium,"  which US forces used in the Gulf.
He hinted that the ailment might also be due "to pills and vaccines that  were given to soldiers," although "they were still under experimentation."
"It is inconceivable that the US medical community, which is known for its  scientific and technological advances, was unable to assess the causes of the  sickness," the spokesman said.
A congressional study released Thursday said troops were exposed to Iraqi  chemical and possibly biological agents during the Gulf War launched by a  US-led military coaltion to free Kuwait from Iraqi occupation.
Senior Pentagon officials said, however, there was no evidence that US  troops were exposed to Iraqi chemical attacks and discounted the possibility  of exposure from fallout from allied bombings of Iraqi chemical or biological  weapon sites.
Senator Donald Riegle, who released the study, sharply criticised the  Pentagon for foot-dragging and suggested it was withholding information on  exposure of US forces to biological material.
