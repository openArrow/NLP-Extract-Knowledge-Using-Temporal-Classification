A French warning about pulling troops out of Bosnia  "is difficult to disagree with," Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said  on returning from the latest peace talks in Geneva, ITAR-TASS news agency  reported on Monday.
Kozyrev was referring to a statement by French counterpart Alain Juppe  that withdrawal from the UN Protection Force was a possibility if the  bloodshed continued, "and it is difficult not to be in agreement with that,"  the minister told Russian journalists late Sunday.
The reaction of the belligerents to the latest settlement proposals were  "promising," since there "was at least no outright rejection," Kozyrev  remarked.
The minister said a "war of parliaments" would be highly undesirable. He  was referring to a vote by the US Senate to permit arms sales to Bosnia, and a  vote by the Duma here that the Russian government should ignore international  sanctions against rump Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).
