An undersea earthquake measuring 5.8 on the  open-ended Richter scale rippled through Taiwan on Monday, but no damage or  casualties were immediately reported, the Central Weather Bureau said.
The tremor struck at 13:36 (0536 GMT) and lasted for some 50 seconds, the  bureau said, adding that it shook high-rise buildings across the island.
Its epicenter was located 110.4 kilometers (68.6 miles) east of Hualien in  eastern Taiwan and 7.2 kilometers (4.5 miles) in depth, it added.
Taiwan is situated on a earthquake belt, but most tremors are centered  under the surrounding sea, which tones down their destructive strength.
Earthquakes of magnitude six on the Richter scale are capable of causing  severe damage in a populated area, while one registering seven is considered a  major tremor capable of widespread, heavy damage.
