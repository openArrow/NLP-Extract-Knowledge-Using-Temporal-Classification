The British Labour group at the European  Parliament threatened Sunday to block the investiture of the new European  Commission if Italian neo-fascists are appointed to it.
Sunday's threat came in a letter from the head of the Labour group of  MEPs, Pauline Green, to British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. The letter's  contents were revealed in a Socialist group statement.
Italy's new government headed by media magnate Silvio Berlusconi contains  five neo-fascist ministers.
The Treaty of Maastricht on European Union gives the European Parliament  the power to confirm the new commission, which is due to take office on  January 5.
The Socialist group statement said the threat not to endorse the  commission had the backing of Labour's Socialist allies, who together form the  largest group in the European assembly.
"The inclusion of fascists in a European government for the first time  since the war is an appalling step backwards which the British government  should condemn," Green said. "It is not enough to say that they were  legitimately elected. So was Hitler."
"We will veto any attempt to appoint fascist commissioners," she added,  pointing out that the European Union was "founded on the ashes of fascism."
