The Moslem-led Bosnian army and the Bosnian Croat  militia formed a joint command Sunday in line with an agreement to form a  Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia-Hercegovina, Radio Sarajevo reported.
The command is headed by Bosnian army General Fikret Muslimovic and Croat  General Ante Roso, it said.
Formation of the joint command was scheduled as the first step in creating  a joint Croat-Bosnian armed force called for under the federation agreement  reached in Washington in March.
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic said Thursday that merging the two  forces, which fought bitterly over territory in central and southern Bosnia  prior to the Washington accord, would be the most difficult aspect of the  federation pact.
Under the original agreement, the federation was to cover 51 percent of  pre-war Bosnian territory.
But last week Croat and Bosnian negotiators finalized their map for a  federation covering 58 percent of Bosnia-Hercegovina, despite the fact that  Bosnian Serbs -- who were not a party to the agreement -- currently hold 70  percent of the territory.
A formal signing ceremony of the federation agreement had been scheduled  to take place in the presence of US Secretary of State Warren Christopher in  Geneva Saturday but was cancelled, reportedly due to US and Russian anger at  the larger territory sought by the two former enemies.
