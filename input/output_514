Comedienne and television star Roseanne Arnold  filed a second time for divorce from husband Tom Arnold, a rerun of last  month's filing.
Last time she accused her husband of beating her, but Friday she cited  irreconcilable differences. Last time Tom Arnold said the two would reconcile.  This time he had no comment.
Roseanne Arnold asked in her petition that she not be forced to pay  alimony and requested a judge to divide her multimillion-dollar assets.
She is one of the stars of the hit television comedy "Roseanne." Her  husband has a less successful comedy on another network called "Tom."
