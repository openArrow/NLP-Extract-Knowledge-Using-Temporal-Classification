South Africa hopes to retake its seat in  the UN General Assembly by the end of June said Vice President Thabo Mbeki  Thursday.
The United Nations stripped the South African representatives of their  powers in 1974 because of the country's apartheid policies.
Mbeki said a UN special committee against apartheid is currently in South  Africa.
"I think it can be expected that they will recommend that the credentials  of South Africa should be restored. That would come around the 23rd of June,"  he said.
On Wednesday the United Nations voted to end the arms embargo imposed  against South Africa in 1977.
