Delors
BRUSSELS, May 17 (AFP) - The European Union is facing a "crisis of growth"  as it wrestles with the problems of incorporating new members, Jacques Delors,  president of the EU's executive European Commission, said here Tuesday.
He was addressing the newly-formed Committee of the Regions, a body formed  under the EU's Maastricht Treaty to give local communities a voice in Brussels.
"How do we extend our values of peace and mutual recognition to all the  countries of Europe while still retaining the goal of a united community?"  Delors asked.
He called for a fundamental reform of EU institutions after the union's  planned expansion to take in Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden next year.
The EU has scheduled a conference in 1996 to streamline its functions with  a view to ensuring that expansion will not weaken its capacity to take quick  and effective decisions and actions.
Delors warned against the "easy" option" of an infinitely elastic EU, and  was critical of German pressure to absorb the new democracies of central and  eastern Europe into the union.
The EU would have to double its annual budget -- currently at about 73  billion ecu (84 billion dollars) -- if Hungary, Poland, the Czech and Slovak  republics, Romania and Bulgaria were to join, he said.
Germans should make their own calculations about how this would translate  into higher taxes, he added.
