Ireland will give five uncapped players a  taste of Australian conditions in their opening rugby union tour clash against  Western Australia here Wednesday.
Tour manager Frank Sowman on Monday announced a young team including  uncapped forwards Keith Wood, Jeremy Davidson, Victor Costello and David  Corkery, and centre Martin Ridge.
Wood is a 22-year-old hooker from Garryowen; Davidson, 20, is a lock from  Dungannon; while Costello, 23, from St Mary's College, and Corkery, 21, from  Cork Constitution, are both included in the back row.
Ridge, a 30-year-old from Leinster who has played for Ireland A, is given  a chance at inside centre.
Sowman said: "Although we have gone for a youthful combination, the  uncapped guys are backed up by Five Nation regulars, including the star  combination of fly-half Eric Elwood and scrum-half and captain Michael Bradley.
"The Irish selectors certainly do not underate any opposition."
He said the selectors wanted to give all players an opportunity to show  their talents in the opening two games of the eight-match tour but it would be  difficult to include all 30 squad members.
Ireland coach Gerry Murphy expressed disappointment that his players would  miss the opportunity in the two Tests of opposing Australia's star centre  combination of Tim Horan and Jason Little.
Both incurred serious knee injuries in Queensland's win over Natal in the  Super 10 final in Durban on Saturday. The duo, considered the best centre  pairing in the world, are certain to miss the Tests in Brisbane on June 5 and  Sydney on June 11.
