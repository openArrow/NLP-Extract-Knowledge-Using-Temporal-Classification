A judge sentenced a piano teacher accused  of molesting two young girls to 30 days in jail, and ordered him to give his  12,000-dollar piano away and keep his fingers off the keyboard for 20 years.
"He stole the desire from these girls to play the piano, so he shouldn't  be able to play the piano either" State District Judge Ted Poe said Wednesday  on sentencing 66-year-old George Marrs.
Marrs pleaded no contest to molesting two girl students aged nine and 10.
His piano is to be donated to a Houston children's home and he may not  purchase or play another piano for 20 years.
Marrs was also ordered to hang a sign outside his front door warning: "No  Children Under the Age of 18 Allowed on These Premises by Court Order."
