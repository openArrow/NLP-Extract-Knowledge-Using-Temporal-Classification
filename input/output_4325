Severiano Ballesteros swallowed his  disappointment on Thursday over the venue for the 1997 Ryder Cup and pledged  to do his best to make the match a success.
Ballesteros said: "I think that it is great that Spain will be the host.
"It will take golf in my homeland to a new level of excitement and  appreciation for all golfers, rich or poor."
Ballesteros had campaigned vehemently against the Valderrama club, calling  it elitist, and had accused it of offering him one million dollars' worth of  inducements to support its candidacy.
The prospective Ryder Cup captain had campaigned instead for the Novo  Sancti Petri course near Cadiz, which he himself had designed, arguing that a  public venue would better promote the game among Spanish people.
But Ballesteros congratulated Valderrama and its Bolivian millionaire  owner, Jaime Ortiz-Patino, on the eve of the PGA championship here.
He said: "I am sure that everyone of the American and European teams will  enjoy Valderrama.
"I have served golf for the last 20 years and I will continue to do that  from here on, especially for the Ryder Cup team and everything that is  involved there and to golf generally in Europe.
"I also send my best regards to all the members of the Ryder Cup  committee. They have worked and laboured hard to serve on this board to make  the right choice and the fairest selection.
