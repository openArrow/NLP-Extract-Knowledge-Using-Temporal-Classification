The contact group trying to restart the Bosnian  peace talks is to meet Wednesday in Talloires, a town in the French Alps,  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Tuesday.
The group, which includes experts from the European Union, Russia, the  United States and the United Nations, is attempting to define a common stand  concerning Bosnia in order to press the warring factions there to end the more  than two-year conflict.
"If the parties involved don't want peace we will act accordingly," Juppe  said.
The group is to hold a ministry-level meeting in mid-June.
