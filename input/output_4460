Italy's new Foreign Minister Antonio Martino rebuked  French President Francois Mitterrand for saying that there was a risk of major  changes to democracy in Italy under a coalition which includes neo-fascists.
Martino told reporters on the fringes of the Conference on Stability in  Europe here that Mitterrand's comments about the presence of the neo-fascist  MSI in media magnate Sivlio Berlusconi's government were "unacceptable".
He recalled that Mitterrand himself had in 1981 criticised those who  carped at the presence of communists in his cabinet.
Berlusconi's office put out a statement Thursday saying that there was  nothing fearsome or equivocal about Berlusconi's coming to power.
