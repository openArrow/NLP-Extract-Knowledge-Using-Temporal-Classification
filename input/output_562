Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres is to meet  PLO leader Yasser Arafat in Oslo in the coming week, Israeli state television  said Saturday.
The two men have been invited by the Norwegian government to take part in  a ceremony marking the secret negotiations held between Israel and the  Palestine Liberation Organisation in Oslo in early 1993 which eventually led  to the accord on Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho.
Former US president Jimmy Carter, who co-sponsored the first agreement  between Israel and an Arab country in 1979 which led to peace with Egypt, has  also been invited to attend.
