US and Japanese negotiators were to meet  Saturday to try to break a three-month deadlock in trade talks, a US official  said.
"Both sides felt that it would be important to meet this afternoon to  further clarify and address the issues on the table," said Anne Luzzatto,  spokeswoman for the US Trade Representative.
There was some confusion earlier over whether the two sides would meet at  the weekend. USTR Mickey Kantor arrived at his office early in the day but  would say only that no meeting was planned for the morning.
US officials had said Friday that they would meet Saturday, but at one  point Saturday officials said no meeting was likely before Monday.
The extension of the talks, that had been scheduled to last one day,  Thursday, and the confusing statements before the Saturday meeting was  announced, indicated the two sides were involved in serious, detailed  discussion.
The few comments made by officials since Thursday morning have generally  been hopeful.
Both sides have kept comments to a minimum, but Kantor said that the talks  had started well.
