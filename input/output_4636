International donors have pledged 3.5 million  dollars to help Mozambique's political parties prepare for the October  elections, the UN special envoy here, Aldo Ajello, said Friday.
Italy pledged 1.8 million dollars and the European Union some 960,000  dollars to a United Nations Trust Fund set up to help Mozambican parties  contest the country's first ever multiparty elections scheduled for October.
Ajello said he was amazed the country's National Elections Commission  (CNE) is unable to set up rules for disbursing the money to the 18 political  parties.
"If they can't do they must indicate an institution which can," he said.
But neither the UN peacekeeping operation (UNOMOZ) nor the CNE has agreed  to take responsibility for deciding how to divide the money among the parties.
Meanwhile, some 14 opposition parties including the formerly rebel  Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO) on Friday continued the first national  congress of opposition parties, discussing both the trust fund and possibility  of selecting a sole opposition candidate for presidential elections.
RENAMO, said to be funding the conference, is reportedly promoting its own  leader, Afonso Dhlakama for the role.
