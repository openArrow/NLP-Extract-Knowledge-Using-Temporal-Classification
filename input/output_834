The first major shipment of foreign apples to Japan  arrived at the western Japanese port of Kobe from New Zealand on Monday.
The 19 tonnes of apples represented the first significant import of  foreign apples since the Japanese government enacted a law in 1971 to  liberalize apple imports, press reports said.
Despite the formal liberalization, Japan had continued its ban on apple  imports from major exporters such as New Zealand and the United States, citing  possible risks from insects and viruses arriving with foreign products.
A total of four million to five million tonnes of New Zealand apples are  expected to enter Japan this year, an official of the Agriculture, Forestry  and Fisheries Ministry said.
The ministry has decided to lift the import ban on apples from New Zealand  last June as it had complied with technical limitations, the official said.
The ministry is expected to lift the ban on US apples as well.
The first load of New Zealand apples were expected to go onto store  shelves by around Friday after quarantine inspections, the official said.
Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) said the imported apples were unlikely to  be an immediate threat to Japanese farmers. A kilogram (2.2 pounds) of New  Zealand apples would cost about 800 yen (7.60 dollars), twice the price of  local apples.
Last month, when a sample consignment of New Zealand apples arrived at  Tokyo's Narita airport, Japanese apple growers passed out free samples of  their fruit to convince consumers that homegrown apples were better than  imports.
