Tony Blair launched his bid for leadership of the  opposition Labour Party Tuesday calling for "national renewal", in his first  speech since the death two weeks ago of former Labour leader John Smith.
Blair, the shadow home secretary, said there was a need for "national  renewal (and for) rebuilding a strong civic society".
Speaking at the London Institute of Economic Affairs, Blair said Britain  should look further than the traditional pattern of "narrow and selfish  individualism" versus "the old notions of state control".
"Instead, we should fashion a new relationship between society and the  individual for the future.... where rights and duties go hand in hand," said  Blair, who belongs to Labour's so-called "modern" faction.
He said Labour wanted to "rebuild our nation as a strong and active  society".
In the race for the Labour leadership, Blair has a 13 percent lead over  his nearest rival, according to a Guardian/ICM survey published on Tuesday.
Among all voters Blair polled 30 percent, while his nearest rival,  employment spokesman John Prescott, scored 17 percent.
Acting Labour leader Margaret Beckett, Smith's deputy, stands on 13  percent, shadow chancellor Gordon Brown 12 percent, and shadow secretary of  state for trade and industry Robin Cook 8 percent.
Blair's lead is less impressive among Labour voters alone. There, the  findings are Blair 31 percent, Prescott 22 percent, Beckett 13 percent, Brown  13 percent and Cook 9 percent.
The balance of the percentages in each table is the number of people who  either did not know or who did not want to say.
ICM interviewed 1,420 people over the age of 18 face-to-face last Friday  and Saturday, just after the funeral of Smith, who died of a heart attack on  May 12.
