A Singaporean survivor of the stampede that  claimed the lives of hundreds of Moslem pilgrims in Saudi Arabia said Thursday  there was nothing he could do to help those who fell before him in the deadly  crush of bodies.
"All you could do was move forward with the crowd as you were being pushed  and shoved yourself," said Azmi Omar, 30, a computer programmer, adding that  he saw pilgrims trampled before him in the pandemonium.
"They looked like Pakistani men to me, smaller than those who were doing  all the pushing and shoving. The more aggressive ones looked like Africans to  me," he told the local afternoon tabloid, The New Paper, after arriving here  early Thursday.
The incident took place when Moslems were performing the ritual of  "stoning the devil" in Mina, 10 kilometers (six miles) east of Mecca. Saudi  authorities say some 200 pilgrims died but some media estimates say the toll  is many times that figure.
Azmi said that he "shoved and pushed" his way out of the crowd. "You have  to get out as soon as possible ... You can suffocate there," he said.
A religious teacher, Fouzy (eds. one name), said he went to the scene of  the disaster some two hours after the crush and saw bodies being stretchered  out.
"I saw officials, police and ambulance officers rushing about to take the  bodies out," he said.
Fouzy said that it was impossible to estimate the number of victims.
"They were lying on top of one another," he said.
The two pilgrims were in the first batch of 407 Singaporeans to return  home from Saudi Arabia.
A spokesman for Singapore's Islamic Council said that there were no  Singaporean casualties in the stampede.
"We have been in touch with the authorities in Saudi Arabia and all  Singaporeans are safe," he said.
