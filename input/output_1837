"If I start going out with someone then that person has to modify his  lifestyle a little bit because the only way we can see each other is for him  to travel with me. And that's hard. Not everybody wants to do it. Then there  are others who don't like all the attention they get by being with me."
"I think it would be great to have a boyfriend travelling with me on the  tour. It would not distract me from the tennis. In fact I think it would have  just the opposite effect."
Still delightfully shy, Sabatini has nevertheless become increasingly  self-confident away from the tennis court. And she claims her new  self-assurance started when she gave a first-ever "public" singing performance  in New York.
Sabatini loves to sing, and her willingness to take the microphone at the  annual Virginia Slims Championships party back in November 1992 was  significant.
"When I first sang in public it was the most difficult thing,", she  recalled, adding: "I was actually shaking."
Now there is every possibility that when her playing days are over  Sabatini may take up singing full-time.
"I like music. I like to sing. So that is something I would like to do  maybe in the future."
"I can imagine making a record after I finish playing. I've already had  many offers to do so, but I'm not ready yet. I know I need to take lessons to  improve my voice."
Life at home in Buenos Aires is no longer a continuous round of fancy  restaurants and discos. Sabatini often likes to put on her jeans and leave the  bright city lights to become a country girl.
"We have a farm very close to Buenos Aires," she said, adding: "I love it  there. At the farm we have cows and horses and sheep and wheat. My father is  very involved in that.
"I ride the horses sometimes and we've just built a tennis court there so  I spend some time practising."
