GATT chief Peter Sutherland all but ruled out  Friday the possibility of China's rejoining the world trade body by the year's  end, labelling the schedule put forward by Beijing "extremely demanding."
While "encouraged" by three days of talks with senior foreign trade  officials here, Sutherland made it clear that China was some way from  realising its aim to be in at the inception of the World Trade Organisation  (WTO), which replaces the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on  January 1.
"It is still going to be extremely difficult, with the best will in the  world, to achieve the timeframe we have spoken of," Sutherland told a press  conference.
"The time schedule is extremely demanding."
The GATT secretary-general also stressed there was "no practical  difference" in whether China joined the international trading regime on  "January 1, April 1 or June 1."
"Really what we should be talking about is the likelihood of a  satisfactory outcome at the end of the day. The end of the day being not too  distant," he said.
China, which was a founder member of GATT but left after the communists  came to power in 1949, has repeatedly made it clear that it attaches great  political significance to readmission before the new year.
Sutherland said he had seen signs of "genuine will and flexibility" from  the Chinese side during his visit, but added that doubts remained over the  transparency of China's foreign trade regime, especially policies governing  import quotas, licences and standards.
"I do not wish to minimise the amount of additional discussion that has to  be undertaken," he said.
