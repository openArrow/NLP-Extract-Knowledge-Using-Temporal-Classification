Troubled England spinner Phil Tufnell has been  given time off by his county, Middlesex, to sort out problems in his personal  life.
The announcement follows a decision by Ray Illingworth, chairman of the  England selectors, that the bowler cannot be considered for the Test matches  against New Zealand until his domestic life is more settled.
Tufnell, 27, is on bail, charged with assaulting his former fiancee, Jane  McEvoy, 25, and other offences.
He himself was treated in hospital for head injuries earlier this month  and Miss McEvoy's father Michael, 50, has been charged with causing the player  grievous bodily harm.
The couple are said to be in dispute over custody of their 18-month-old  daughter Ellie.
Middlesex County Cricket Club secretary Joe Hardstaff said on Wednesday  Tufnell had been released from duty for "a few weeks".
He said: "At the moment, Philip is not in the right frame of mind to give  of his best on the cricket field."
