Denmark intends backing the creation of a  sanctuary for whales in the Antarctic at this month's meeting in Mexico of the  International Whaling Commission, sources at the environment and foreign  ministries said here Friday.
Parliament's environment committee gave its agreement in principle this  week and is due to give full endorsement next Wednesday, provided Greenland  gets a supplementary quota for catching rorquals off the island.
Denmark abstained in last year's vote. The policy change should ensure a  two-thirds majority for the sanctuary this time, the environment ministry  sources said.
The Danish branch of the ecological movement Greenpeace said it was  delighted with the decision. Greenpeace spokeswoman Kirsten Sander alleged  that Japan had tried to buy off the votes of five small IWC member states,  which she did not name.
On Thursday Greenpeace welcomed Chile's decision to support the sancutary  proposal, saying indicated President Eduardo Frei's new government "is willing  to act boldly on global environmental issues."
The Danish and Chilean announcements supporting a Southern Ocean whale  sanctuary proposal will virtually assure the sancutary's passage by the  International Whaling Commission (IWC) this month, Greenpeace said Thursday.
