United States manager Bora Milatonovic is allowing  midfielder John Harkes to join his World Cup squad two days late so he can  play in a key club match.
Harkes, 27, will line up for Derby County in the First Division play-off  final against Leicester City at Wembley on Monday. Victory would win the Rams  a place in the Premiership.
The New Jersey-born player said: "Bora could have decided to pull me out  of the play-off matches and ordered me home to train with the rest of the  squad, but he has been very understanding.
"He also recognises playing competitive football is far better than taking  part in friendlies."
