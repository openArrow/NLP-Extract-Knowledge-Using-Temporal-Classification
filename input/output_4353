Michael Stich joined Stefan Edberg among the  'also-rans' at the French Open on Thursday when he was beaten in straight-sets  in the second-round by Aaron Krickstein of the United States.
Stich, seeded second and with high hopes of winning the title after  excellent results at the World Team Cup in Dusseldorf last week, had said  before Thursday's clash that he could see no reason why an attacking player  could not win the world's supreme clay court test.
But he was made to eat his words, however, when 33rd-ranked baseliner  Krickstein scored a humiliating 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 win in 1hr 43 mins.
Another 'serve-and-volley' specialist, Stefan Edberg, was eliminated in  the first-round by compatriot Henrik Holm and as the tournament progresses  only world number-one Pete Sampras is still considered a serious title hope  among the non clay-court specialists.
Six men's seeds have been beaten so far. Apart from Stich and Edberg, 1992  Czech finalist Petr Korda, Sweden's Magnus Gustafsson, Spain's Carlos Costa  and France's Cedric Pioline have also failed to survive.
Stich, who counted both Sampras and defending champion Sergi Bruguera  among his victims in Dusseldorf, admitted he would have been better off  staying in bed.
The 23-year-old German, a semi-finalist three years ago, did not hide his  disappointment.
"I played bad. I didn't serve well. I had a problem with my elbow -- it  was one of those days I should have stayed in bed. I would have lost to anyone  out there today," he said
