South Africa was Monday formally accepted as a  member of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo  said in a statement here.
Nzo said the fledgling South African government had been informed of the  decision by OAU Secretary General Salim Salim.
"To commemorate the admission of the Republic of South Africa as the 53rd  member state of the organization, a special flag-raising ceremony shall take  place on May 25 at the OAU headquarters," Salim's office said in a statement  issued in Addis Ababa.
A foreign ministry official said earlier Monday that Nzo and First Deputy  President Thabo Mbeki were to visit the Ethiopian capital Wednesday for the  official raising of the South African flag on the international body's 31st  anniversary.
Director General Rusty Evans told reporters in Cape Town that Nzo would  also represent South Africa at an OAU ministerial meeting in Tunis on June  6-12.
Evans also announced that the June 13-16 OAU summit, also in Tunis, would  be attended by Nelson Mandela, taking his first overseas trip as South African  president.
According to Evans, South Africa's return to the Commonwealth was "a  foregone conclusion" and that discussions were under way for the resumption of  the country's full membership at the United Nations.
One potential sticking point, he said, was the payment of South Africa's  arrears of more than 100 million dollars to the world body in dues unpaid  since the U.N. Credentials Committee rejected Pretoria's credentials in 1974.
But ministry officials said they believed the matter would be cleared up  by the next U.N. General Assembly session scheduled for September.
