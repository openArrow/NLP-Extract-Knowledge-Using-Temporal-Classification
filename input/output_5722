Seven Afghan children rummaging for wood in  war-damaged houses were killed Tuesday when a rocket exploded near Kabul's  southern frontline, residents said.
The incident took place at Shahra-e-Kuohna, where forces loyal to Afghan  president Burhanuddin Rabbani are facing Uzbek warlord general Abdul Rashid  Dustom's militia, they said.
Afghan children are sometimes engaged by rival troops to prepare tea and  food for the fighters, wash their clothes or ferry ammunition from depots.
In return they are allowed to collect the wood from shops and houses  destroyed in the fighting.
More than 2,500 people have died since January in the fighting between  pro-Rabbani forces and the combined forces of Dostam and prime minister  Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. The number of injured exceeds 17,000.
