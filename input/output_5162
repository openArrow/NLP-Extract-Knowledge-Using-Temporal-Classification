World number one cyclist Miguel Indurain   slumped to a shock defeat in the Tour of Italy here on Sunday as he was  crushed in his favourite time-trial discipline.
Indurain, regarded as almost unbeatable in solo rides, could only finish  fourth, over two-and-a-half minutes behind as overall leader Evgeni Berzin of  Russia underlined his dominance during the 44km eight stage.
That result may well mean the end of the Spaniard's hopes of clinching a  hat-trick of Giro titles -- and must also throw into doubt his hopes of  winning his fourth consecutive Tour de France title.
The 24-year-old Berzin, winner of the Liege-Bastogne-Liege classic earlier  this year, beat Frenchman Armand de las Cuevas by over a minute on the stage  between Grosseto and Follonica, with Italian Gianni Bugno coming third.
The margin of Indurain's defeat, which left him over three-and-a-half  minutes off the overall pace, was astonishing.
He has based his major tour victories on time-trial domination and then  defensive riding. The Spaniard won his last two Tour de France without winning  a single stage outside the time trials.
