The dollar rose against other major currencies  here early Friday in moderately active trading after an unexpected upward  revision of first-quarter US economic growth, but was limited by a bond  selloff.
The Commerce Department said US gross domestic product rose three percent  in the first three months, up from an initial estimate of 2.6 percent growth.  Most experts had forecast a downward revision to 2.4 percent.
Gold, meanwhile, rose to 384.70 dollars an ounce, up 90 cents from late  Thursday.
At about 9:30 a.m. (1330 GMT), the dollar traded at 1.6502 German marks,  up from 1.6485 just after the GDP report, and compared with 1.6480 late  Thursday.
Against the yen, it was at 104.68 up from 104.60 about 45 minutes earlier  and down from 104.65 the night before.
At midday in London, the US currency was quoted at 1.6480 marks and 104.63  yen.
The greenback rose to 5.6375 French francs from 5.6300 late Thursday, to  1.4092 Swiss francs (1.4065) and to 0.6639 pound sterling (0.6627).
Ed Neminski, a trader at Nomura Securities, said the market's pace would  quickly slow as many traders leave work early for the long Memorial Day  holiday weekend.
Neminski said the dollar continues to meet significant resistance at the  1.6520-mark and 105.15-yen levels. But if the dollar leaps those barriers, it  could continue to climb, he said.
The dollar's advance was slowed by a selloff on the bond market, where  interest rates, which move inversely to bond prices, shot up after the GDP  report.
Interest rates on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond jumped to 7.44  percent from 7.36 percent late Thursday.
Neminski predicted the dollar would move between 1.6420 and 1.6520 marks  and 104.40 and 105.00 yen for the rest of the session.
