More than 30 aid organisations urged  feuding Kurdish factions in Iraqi Kurdistan on Tuesday to stop fighting or  face a possible halt to international aid.
The warning was delivered at a meeting between non-governmental  humanitarian organisations (NGOs) including the United Nations, and officers  of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and Kurdistan Democratic Party (KPD)  in the town of Salaheddin.
"We love the Kurdish people. We want to go on working. So, please, fight  where every fight in a democratic system should take place, in parliament,"  said Terry Aislabie of Shelter Now International.
The Kurds have had their own parliament since May 1992, a year after an  uprising against the Iraqi army since when the KDP and PUK have controlled the  north under Western protection, in defiance of Baghdad.
"At this moment, a new budget of about 22 million dollars is being decided  in Brussels," said Kees Rietveld, coordinator for ECHO (European Community  Humanitarian Office).
If the PUK and DPK clashes, which have claimed more than 100 lives over  the last three weeks, do not stop, "it will be difficult to defend" the aid  package, he warned.
The meeting was called by the UN deputy coordinator for Iraq, Steve Allen  of Britain, to highlight the security risks facing non-governmental  organisations (NGOs).
"We need as soon as possible realistic ideas when security can be  guaranteed again for the people working here, not only for ourselves, but for  our local staff who are facing a lot of hostility from both sides," he said.
The humanitarian groups called on a a joint operational room set up to  implement a ceasefire to make sure that checkpoints were dismantled and for  Kurdish leaders to calm their fighters.
They also urged the feuding groups to withdraw their guards from the two  hospitals of Arbil, the main town in Iraqi Kurdistan.
The fighting has split Kurdistan into KDP and PUK areas.
