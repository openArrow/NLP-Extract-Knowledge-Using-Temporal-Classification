Sergi Bruguera had the last laugh when he beat  dangerous teenage rival Andrei Medvedev 6-3, 6-2, 7-5 to move just two matches  away from retaining his French Open crown here Tuesday.
Bruguera, seeded sixth, who also beat Medvedev in the semi-finals last  year, lost to the Ukranian in the final of this year's Monte Carlo Open.
The Spaniard now plays Jim Courier, who defeated compatriot and world  number-one Pete Sampras in four sets, for a place in next Sunday's final.
Courier lost to Bruguera in last year's final.
