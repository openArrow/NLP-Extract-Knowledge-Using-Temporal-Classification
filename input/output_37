Blue-chip stocks rallied Thursday amid easing  long-term interest rates after the government released figures showing  inflation under control.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 22.80 points to close at 3,652.84.
On the broader market, advancers outpaced decliners 1,184 to 977 with 659  shares unchanged. Some 274 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock  Exchange.
On the bond market, interest rates on the main 30-year Treasury bond fell  to 7.57 percent from 7.59 percent Wednesday, a sign of easing investor fears  of inflation and higher rates.
The rates declined further earlier in the day but rebounded after San  Francisco Federal Reserve president Robert Parry suggested he might favor  boosting short-term rates again.
The decline in interest rates came after the release of a government  report showing wholesale prices fell 0.1 percent in April, surprising analysts.
The reports "relieve some of the fear that the economy was going to  explode on the upside," said Alfred Goldman of A.G. Edwards and Sons.
But he added that investors still have not ruled out another interest rate  hike by the Federal Reserve, which has already raised rates three times this  year.
Allied-Signal rose 1-1/2 to 35-3/4, Sears 1-1/4 to 48-3/4 and Philip  Morris 3 to 50-1/2.
ITT fell 1-1/4 to 82-3/4 after announcing plans for a new Las Vegas  casino,  Texas Instruments was off 1-1/4 to 71-1/2 and J.P Morgan 3/4 to  61-5/8.
