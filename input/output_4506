Sales at major Japanese retail stores in April  remained their levels of a year earlier for the 23rd straight month due to  sluggish consumer spending, a government report said Friday.
Sales at 421 department stores and 2,056 supermarkets across the country  dipped 3.5 percent from a year earlier to 1,705.4 billion yen (about 16.2  billion dollars), the ministry of international trade and industry said.
Of the total, department store sales accounted for 867.8 billion yen, down  2.9 percent from a year earlier, and supermarket sales dropped 4.0 percent to  837.7 billion yen, the ministry said.
