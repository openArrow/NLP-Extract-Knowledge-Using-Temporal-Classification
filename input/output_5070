Hungarians began voting Sunday to determine if  erstwhile reform communists in the Socialist Party can maintain a strong first  round lead and secure an absolute majority in parliament.
Following an initial poll three weeks ago, 259 of the 386 seats in  parliament remain to be filled in Sunday's vote, in which eight million  Hungarians are eligible to cast ballots in the country's second democratic  election since the fall of communism in 1989.
The outcome in 174 of the 259 seats will be decided by simple majority in  individual constituencies, provided voter participation is at least 25 percent.
The remaining 85 slots will be assigned according to a proportional  distribution scheme.
In the May 8 first round vote the Socialist Party (MSZP) under former  foreign minister Gyula Horn, 61, captured 57 seats and is leading in 158  constituencies and second place in 15 others.
The liberal Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), with whom the socialists  could form a coalition in the future government, won 28 seats in the first  round and is in first place in 12 consituencies and in second place in 125.
The Democratic Forum (MDF), the main component in the outgoing  conservative administration, won but a single seat on May 8 and is leading in  only one constituency.
The polling institute Szonda has predicted that the socialists will end up  controlling between 175 and 208 seats and the Alliance of Free Democrats  between 67 and 86. The absolute majority is 194.
But what remains to be seen is if voters, after having so decisively  crushed the ruling conservative coalition in the first round, have since  become anxious over the scope of the former communists' success.
Horn, the MSZP leader, has expressed interest in becoming prime minister  if invited. He suffered a car accident before the first round and still  appears in public with a neck brace.
Polling stations close at 7:00 p.m. (1700 GMT) and early returns are  expected minutes later.
