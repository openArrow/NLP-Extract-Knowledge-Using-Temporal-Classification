Rosemary West, wife of accused serial  killer Frederick West, has been charged with the murder of an eighth young  woman in the so-called "House of Horrors" case, police said Tuesday.
The latest charge against the 40-year-old mother of eight involves the  murder of Alison Jane Chambers, a native of Hanover, Germany, who disappeared  here in 1979 at the age of 17 and whose remains were unearthed at the West  home at 25 Cromwell Street here.
Rosemary West now stands accused, jointly with her husband, a 52-year-old  stone mason, of eight murders relating to the remains of young women and girls  found in the garden, basement, walls and floors of their house.
Frederick West alone is charged with murdering his first wife, found in a  cornfield 20 kilometers (12 miles) away.
He is also charged alone with murdering two of his daughters, one found in  another Gloucester house where they once lived, the second one of the nine  bodies found at 25 Cromwell Street.
Rosemary West is also charged, in conjunction with two men, in the rape of  a girl under the age of 16, and assault against an eight-year-old boy.
Frederick West is due in court here on a remand appearance June 2. Police  said they were still questioning Rosemary West, due in court on June 3.
Investigators said they were continuing to probe locations where the Wests  previously lived, and sources close to the investigation said the body count  could exceed 20.
