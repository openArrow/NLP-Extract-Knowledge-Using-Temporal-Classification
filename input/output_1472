A new law legalizing the consumption and possession  of drugs for personal use in Colombia, home to the world's most powerful  cocaine cartels, took effect Tuesday.
The May 5 ruling by the Constitutional Court has drawn an angry response  from President Cesar Gaviria's government, which is engaged in a virtual state  of war with cocaine cartels based in Cali and Medellin.
The high court ruled five to four that the state was "playing God" by  banning personal use of drugs and that the ban violated the constitution.
"The state was being lord and master of the lives of everyone. ... In a  free society everyone must be responsible for his own acts," the court's  ruling said.
The ruling allows individuals to possess up to 20 grams of marijuana, five  grams of hashish, one gram of cocaine, and two grams of substances similar to  LSD.
Under the old law, anyone nabbed with even those quantities of the drugs  listed could have been held under arrest for as many as 30 days and fined the  equivalent of 60 dollars.
