Thursday's French Open notebook:
Thirtysomething blues
It has not been a good year for the thirtysomethings at the French Open.  In both the men's and women's singles only one player who has passed their  30th birthday remain in the tournament. In the men's, Brad Gilbert, 32,  carries the veterans' flag into battle against Andrea Gaudenzi, a 20-year-old  Italian upstart, while Lori McNeil, who passed the 30 milestone in December,  is not been given much chance against 19-year-old Mary Pierce.

Going bananas
Players' faith in the nutritional qualities of bananas is stronger than  ever. Following the lead of noted on-court nibblers Boris Becker and Jim  Courier, the senior players here munched their way through nearly 810 kg of  the fruit  -- nearly four a day per player on the basis of some  back-of-an-envelope arithmetic.

Hacks lagging
"Those who can do, those who can't write about it," sums up the dismissive   attitude of many players to the journalists who follow the sport. And on the  evidence at Roland Garros, they might have a point. In a competition organised  by the company that times serves on the men's tour, the best anybody from the  press could manage was a 125kmh service -- a mere 100kmh behind the fastest  players. The general public fared better: one talented amateur producing a  192kmh effort. (AFP)
