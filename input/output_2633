Nine supporters of the United Democratic Front  (UDF), celebrating their party's election victory, were crushed to death by a  bus, state radio said Friday.
The radio said the driver of the bus, which belonged to UDF deputy James  Makhumula, appeared to have driven into a crowd of UDF supporters.
Several others were injured in the crash, which happened Thursday in  Machinga, the home district of President-elect, Bakili Muluzi, the radio said.
Meanwhile the defeated Malawi Congress Party said that UDF supporters in  the capital, Lilongwe, made a "mock coffin" of outgoing President Hastings  Kamuzu Banda after he conceded defeat Thursday.
