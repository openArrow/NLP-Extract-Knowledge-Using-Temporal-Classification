A Russian border guard was shot dead by unknown  attackers on his way to his office Tuesday in the Tajikistan capital Dushanbe,  border guard headquarters said in a report quoted by the ITAR-TASS news agency.
The officer was a lieutenant-colonel, the report said.
He was the second Russian soldier to be killed in three days, after a  border guard was killed Sunday by a sniper in an ambush in Khorog, in  southeastern Tajikistan, according to Russian military sources.
Russian soldiers stationed in this central Asian republic have regularly  been the target of presumed Tajik opponents who are against the Moscow-backed  neo-communist regime in place in Dushanbe.
