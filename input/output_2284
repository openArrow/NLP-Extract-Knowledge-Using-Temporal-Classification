Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Co. Ltd. are  considering separate plans to develop and manufacture small low-priced cars in  Southeast Asia for the local market, company officials said Friday.
But the officials refused to confirm a report that Honda was planning to  to launch production of the new "Asia Car" in Thailand and Indonesia by 1996  followed by a similar move by Toyota in Thailand from 1998.
"The scheme is still under consideration," a Honda spokesman said. A  spokesman for rival carmaker Toyota made similar remarks.
The Nihon Keizai Shimbun said Friday the two companies were planning to  produce 1300-to-1500cc cars to meet growing demand. Toyota hopes to eventually  export the new model to the Middle East and Latin America, the newspaper said.
Toyota currently makes small trucks specifically targetted to the Asian  market in Indonesia, Taiwan, and the Philippines.  Honda produces cars in  Taiwan, India, Thailand, South Korea, and Philipines.
