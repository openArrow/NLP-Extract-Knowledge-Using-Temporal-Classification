Six UN disarmament experts travelled to Iraq on  Monday for a week-long mission to monitor ballistic missiles, a UN official  here said.
The official at the Bahrain-based UN commission for disarming post-war  Iraq said the experts would set up a "technical reference baseline" for Iraqi  missile systems.
The team led by Guy Martelle, a US national, would also check the missile  works' areas in Iraq and prepare for a missile tagging mission scheduled in  early June.
Iraq is banned from having missiles with a range of more 150 kilometers  (90 miles), under the UN ceasefire terms for the 1991 Gulf war.
