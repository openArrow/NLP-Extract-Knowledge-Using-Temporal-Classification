Blue-chip stocks edged up early Thursday, boosted  by stable bond interest rates.
The Dow Jones index of 30 leading industrials was up 7.67 points to  3,762.97 25 minutes after the session opened on the New York Stock Exchange.
Wednesday the Dow rose 10.13 points to finish at 3,755.30.
On the bond market, interest rates on the main 30-year Treasury bond  averaged 7.35 percent, up from 7.34 percent late Wednesday.
Wall Street analysts had their eye on Philip Morris stock, which was not  yet being quoted early Thursday. It closed Tuesday at 53.75 dollars, and was  suspended from trading Wednesday because of speculation about an expected  announcement by the company that it would separate its tobacco and food  businesses. No announcement was made.
