The Franco-British group GEC Alsthom has signed a  letter of intent to set up a joint company for the manufacture of steam  turbines and alternators in China, the company said on Monday.
The letter was signed with Beijing Heavy Electric machine works on Friday  during a visit to Paris by the Mayor of Beijing, Li Qiyan.
This was the first stage of the negotiation procedure which was likely to  be completed during the next few months, GEC Alsthom said.
The venture would be sited in the suburbs of Beijing. The European and  Chinese companies have been cooperating since 1986 over the construction of  turbines and alternators in the 300-megawatt range. Such equipment is produced  by Beijing Heavy Electric.
Eight such units for electrical power stations have been built or are  under construction, the French company said.
The proposed joint venture would step up this link from one of cooperation  to local production.
