A powerful bomb badly damaged a Christian  school here early Friday, without causing any casualties, police said.
The explosion wrecked the dining room and blew out windows at the  evangelical protestant school, formerly known as the American School.
The bomb went off at 5 a.m. (0200 GMT) and was heard over a wide distance.
Headmaster Jamil Yazigi ordered the school's temporary closure and police  sealed off the area.
Yazigi said there had been no warning and he was unaware of why the  school, which has 3,300 pupils, had been targeted.
A blast in a Christian church north of Beirut on February 27 killed 10  people and left 54 hurt.
Sidon, hometown of Prime Minister Rafic Hariri, is mainly Sunni and Shiite  Moslem, but has a small Christian community.
