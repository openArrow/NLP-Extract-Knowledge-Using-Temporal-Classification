South Africa's new defense minister, former  guerrilla leader Joe Modise, announced Tuesday that he would maintain General  Georg Meiring as chief the National Defence Force (SANDF).
Meiring, 54, and Modise, 65, had once been enemies, the former as a career  military man, the latter as head of the African National Congress' guerrilla  army, Umkhonto we Sizwe -- the Spear of the Nation, or MK for short.
"I have no doubt in my mind that our cooperation will be constructive and  sound," Modise told a press conference here, saying the appointment was for  five years.
"It is my sincere wish that under the command of General Meiring, the  SANDF will do its best toward reconciliation, upliftment, prosperity and peace  in our country," Modise said.
