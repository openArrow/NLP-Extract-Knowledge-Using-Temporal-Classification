Russian writer and dissident Alexander  Solzhenitsyn left his isolated New England refuge Wednesday to return to  Russia, 20 years after the old Soviet government ordered him into exile,  according to an AFP reporter.
The 75-year-old Nobel laureate and his wife Natalia will fly to the former  Soviet Union via Anchorage, Alaska and enter eastern Russia first. They are  not expected in the Pacific Russian port of Vladivostok until Friday.
