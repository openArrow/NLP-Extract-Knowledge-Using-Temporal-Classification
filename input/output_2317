The sudden resignation of the US ambassador in  Tel Aviv is a "blow to the peace process," Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister  Yossi Beilin said Friday.
The comments came after an announcement that Edward Djerejian, 55, was  taking up a post as director of the public policy institute at Rice University  in Houston, Texas.
"This is a problematic and sad decision which, in some measure, is a blow  to the peace process because of the role played by Djerejian in recent years,"  Beilin said.
"The American administration will need some time to find someone with such  a deep knowledge of the region."
Djerejian, 55, presented his credentials only on January 13 and has spent  32 years in the foreign service, notably as amassador to Syria.
The institute is endowed in the name of ex-secretary of state James Baker,  whom the ambassador served as Middle East adviser during the presidency of  George Bush.
