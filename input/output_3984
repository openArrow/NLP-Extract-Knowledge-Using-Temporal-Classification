Austrian baseliner Thomas Muster put Andre Agassi  out of the 1974 French Open Tennis Championships at the Roland Garros Stadium  on Wednesday after a gruelling five-set second-round marathon.
Muster, seeded eleventh, beat the twice-finalist 6-3, 6-7 (5/7), 7-5, 2-6,  7-5 and now plays either Patrick Rafter of Australia or Lionel Roux of France  for a place in the last-sixteen.
