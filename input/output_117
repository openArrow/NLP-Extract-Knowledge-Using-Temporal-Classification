The Philippine government on Friday ordered the  immediate closure of four provincial airports, citing gross safety hazards to  aviation.
The Air Transportation Office said in a memorandum that international  civil aviation rules and a Philippine building code "has been violated and  continuously being violated with impunity and total disregard for the safety  of flight operations" in the Dipolog, Bacolod, Cauayan and San Jose airports.
"This cannot be allowed to continue any further as we are exposing every  day passengers and crew to danger, and potential losses of property," the  memorandum said, adding that local government authorities had failed to act on  the violations.
The closure order takes effect at one p.m. (0500 GMT) Friday and covers  general aviation and non-tactical military operations.
Bacolod, in the central islands, and Dipolog in the south are serviced  daily by the national flag carrier Philippine Airlines (PAL), which also flies  four times weekly to San Jose south of Manila and twice a week in Cauayan in  the north.
PAL spokesmen could not be reached for comment on the order.
