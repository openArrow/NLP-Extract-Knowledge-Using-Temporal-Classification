A majority of Quebecers want their predominantly  French-speaking province to opt out of Canada, though sovereignty support has  slipped, according to a poll published Monday by Le Journal de Montreal.
Asked "Are you for or against sovereignty for Quebec?" some 51.9 percent  of those surveyed said yes and 48.1 percent said no, according to the Leger et  Leger Intitute poll of 1,001 voters taken May 13-17.
The results were in line with those of another poll released Saturday by  the SOM institute, with 44 percent favoring an independent Quebec, and 42  percent against.
Pollsters at Leger et Leger said the sovereignty support was actually the  lowest since the October 25 federal elections, which sent 54 pro-sovereignty  legislators from Quebec to the House of Commons in Ottawa. Quebec has a total  75 deputies in the lower house of the federal parliament.
Quebec must hold provincial elections by October at the latest, and the  opposition Parti Quebecois is currently leading in polls, trailed by the  Liberals of provincial Premier Daniel Johnson.
If it wins, the PQ has pledged to call a referendum on Quebec sovereignty  within months of taking power.
Canada's federal system is widely considered to be the world's most  decentralized.
