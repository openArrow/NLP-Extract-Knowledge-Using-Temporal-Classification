Right-wing Italian Prime Minister Silvio  Berlusconi on Saturday dismissed concerns in neighbouring European states  about the presence of neo-fascist ministers in his cabinet.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Berlusconi said the five  ministers from the neo-fascist National Alliance had nothing in common with  extreme-right forces elsewhere in Europe.
"I have obtained a solemn declaration from the National Alliance saying  they are against fascism and any form of despotism," he said.
"Fascists do not exist in my government. They do not exist. There is  nobody in my government who is against liberty and democracy."
French President Francois Mitterrand was among European leaders expressing  concern about the neo-fascists in the coalition government that swept to power  after watershed elections in March, saying that Italian democracy risked major  changes as a result.
Asked about National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini's controversial  remark that wartime fascist leader Benito Mussolini was "the greatest  statesman of the century," Berlusconi insisted that the comment had been  reported out of context.
Mussolini "did some good things for a while" and "history confirms this,"  he said.
Berlusconi also said that he had "no intention of reopening the question  of borders, and would respect treaties signed by previous Italian governments.
He was commenting on a statement by Mirko Tremaglia, a neo-fascist elected  chairman of the parliament's foreign affairs committee, who had evoked a  possible redrawing of the Italian border with Croatia's Adriatic regions of  Istra, Dalmatia and Rijeka.
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman on Friday denounced "Italian  imperialism" following Tremaglia's comments.
"The problem of Croatian stability is posed today in a particular light,  given the results of the Italian elections," Tudjman told Croatian newspaper  editors.
