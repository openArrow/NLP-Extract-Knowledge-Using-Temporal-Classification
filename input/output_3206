Lebanon on Monday condemned Israel's abduction of a  pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem guerilla leader as a blow to the Middle East peace  process.
Saturday's kidnapping of Resistance of the Faithful leader Mustafa Dirani  was "a violation of international law which harmed the already-troubled peace  process," Foreign Minister Fares Bweiz told reporters here.
"I vehemently condemn this operation which is an act of aggression against  Lebanon's security."
Lebanon was considering filing a protest with the UN Security Council, a  foreign ministry source said.
But an official with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, Sheikh Sobhi Tufayli,  accused the Beirut government of complicity in the abduction of Dirani from  his village in eastern Lebanon.
"The Zionists did not snatch him, he was handed over to them," Tufayli  told reporters in Baalbeck, the pro-Iranian stronghold in eastern Lebanon.
The Israeli government said its helicopter-borne commandos kidnapped  Dirani to obtain information on the fate of Ron Arad, a missing Israeli airman  captured in Lebanon in 1986 and believed to be still alive.
Lebanon and Syria, which is the key foreign power broker in Beirut, have  made no tangible progress in their peace talks with Israel since they began in  October 1991.
