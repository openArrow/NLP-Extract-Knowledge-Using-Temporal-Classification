Bernard Tapie, facing personal ruin as his  creditors close in, was expected to name a new major shareholder of Olympique  Marseille soccer club on Friday.
Tapie, being investigated for fraud and embezzlement for both his business  and football activities, was expected to stand down as club president when a  US trading firm invested 180 million francs (32 million dollars).
A commercial court last week appointed an investigator to reccommend  whether the club should be wound up after an audit revealed debts of 404  million francs (73 million dollars).
If the US investor materialises then Tapie may well have covered the debts  as TF1 and Canal Plus television have agreed to pay 200 million francs for  broadcasting rights for the club's UEFA Cup matches next season.
Although Marseille were demoted for allegedly fixing a match to clinch  their fifth successive league title last season, they can still play in the  UEFA Cup because they finished runners-up to this year's champions Paris St  Germain.
On a personal front his biggest creditor, the Credit Lyonnais bank, has  threatened to send in the bailiffs to seize his Paris town house, luxury yacht  and holiday homes in Spain and Morocco.
He had until the end of June to reimburse 600 million francs - half of  what he owes the bank.
He also faces claims from the tax department, social security and customs  for over 100 million francs.
