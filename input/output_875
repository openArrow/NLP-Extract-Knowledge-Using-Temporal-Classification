China is a foreign policy priority for Moscow,  although domestic differences exist on the approach to certain China-related  issues, a senior Russian parliamentarian said here Monday.
Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the Russian parliament's lower house emphasised  the importance Moscow attaches to Sino-Russian ties, but added that some  deputies had opposing views on the questions of border visas and applying the  Chinese economic model in Russia.
Many Russian deputies are believed to be in favour of visa restrictions to  stem the flood of people crossing the Sino-Russian border daily.
Some 2.5 million people crossed the border last year and Moscow has  expressed concern over the number of Chinese in Russia.
While Rybkin praised China's economic success, he stressed that Russia  could not always follow the same path, especially as it did not have the  support of a similarly wealthy overseas community.
Rybkin, who is heading an 11-member parliamentary delegation, met Monday  with President Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Li Lanqing, with whom he discussed  the planned visit to China later this month of Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin.
After the Sino-Soviet rift that developed at the beginning of the 1960s,  the two communist giants officially reconciled in 1989 during a visit to China  by Mikhail Gorbachev.
Since Boris Yeltsin became president of Russia in 1991 following the  collapse of the Soviet Union, Moscow and Beijing have enjoyed close military  cooperation.
Rybkin also voiced hopes that Russia would be able to participate in  several large-scale construction projects in China, including the massive  Three Gorges hydro-electric dam being built on the Yangtze River.
