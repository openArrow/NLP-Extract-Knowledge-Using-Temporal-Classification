Around 9,500 mineworkers agreed to end an  11-day-old strike Sunday at the Kloof gold mine near Carletonville, 50  kilometres (30 miles) west of here, mine owners Gold Fields said.
The workers, who went on strike to protest the dismissal of a union  activist, decided to return to work after a mass meeting early Sunday  addressed by National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) president J Motlatsi.
Gold Fields said in a statement that the miners had agreed to seek  "alternative means" to sort out their grievance and that the first batch would  return to work on the Sunday night shift.
After Sunday's meeting about 200 miners were bussed into Johannesburg  where they gathered outside Gold Field's downtown headquarters to hand over a  memorandum to management repeating their demand that NUM branch chairman  Jackson Mafika be reinstated.
The mine dismissed Mafika after a disciplinary inquiry found that he had  threatened fellow employees for not taking part in a strike in March.
The strikers Thursday defied a court order declaring the strike unlawful  and ordering them back to work.
Gold Fields estimated production losses since the strike began at around  25 million rands (6.9 million dollars).
Miners returned to work at the Western Areas gold mine in the western  Transvaal Saturday where seven miners died in clashes between rival political  groups in the past month, owners Johannesburg Consolidated Industries (JCI)  said.
The seven deaths occured during a period of high tension between  supporters of the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party and the African  National Congress.
NUM officials said politically motivated fighting between IFP and ANC  supporters started on April 17, nine days before South Africa's first all-race  election.
