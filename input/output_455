South African Airways (SAA) will stop its  weekly flight to Lisbon in September as part of a rationalisation programme,  the national carrier said in a statement Saturday.
SAA said the Lisbon route was no longer viable and that the last flight to  the Portuguese capital would depart from Johannesburg on September 2 and would  return the following day.
