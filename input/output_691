Alain Prost and Max Mosley, head of the ruling  International Automobile Federation, want to bury the hatchet and work  together to improve safety in Formula One.
Prost, who retired last year after winning his fourth world title, has  been critical of the FIA over the accidents which killed Ayrton Senna and  Roland Ratzenberger two weeks ago, and of their handling of F1 in general.
Mosley had qualified the Frenchman's allegations, that officialdom was not  concerned about safety, as "outrageous."
However, it was only the latest outbreak in hostilities since Mosley  threatened to deny Prost a licence for last season, after waspish comments the  Frenchman had made about top officials.
But on Sunday the two men had a 45-minute lunch together at Renault's  motorhome before the Monaco Grand Prix.
"There is a difficult situation difficile and we must try to resolve it,"  Prost said afterwards.
"Now that I'm out of F1, I can keep my distance. But my experience of 13  years in F1 and 20 years in motor racing, could bring a great deal. That's why  I met Max Mosley, to see how we could work together to improve things."
The FIA's British president welcomed Prost as an independent driver's  voice.
Current drivers -- plus the retired Austrian world champion Niki Lauda --  voted on Friday to re-form the Grand Prix Drivers Association, and elected  four representatives to discuss safety issues with the FIA.
Mosley said: "The fact that Alain is not a member of those representatives  is an advantage. It enables him to be more independent. We are going to find a  way to collaborate, I'm sure we'll manage it."
