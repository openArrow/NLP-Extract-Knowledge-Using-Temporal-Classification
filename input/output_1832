A congressional subcommittee blocked 100  million dollars in International Monetary Fund appropriations Wedenesday, a  signal to the organzation to reform.
The House of Representatives foreign operations subcommittee dealing with  foreign appropriations cut funding for the IMF Enhanced Structural Adjustment  Facility (ESAF).
ESAF funds go to the poorest nations to restructure their economies and  pay off international debt.
The subcomittee did however approve 23.2 million dollars for the World  Bank.
Non Governmental Organizations (NGO) hailed the IMF rejection, but  expressed dissappointment over the World Bank appropriation.
Both the bank and the fund have come under fire from various groups for  their lending policies. "50 Years is Enough", a coalition of over 35 human  rights and environmental groups, kicked off a campaign Tuesday calling for  reform of the institutions.
The coalition, which takes its name from the fact that 1994 is the 50th  anniversary of the fund and bank founding, is pressing Congress to hold all  IMF and World Bank appropriations until the institutions have changed.
They are demanding more local-level participation in IMF and World Bank  projects as well as increased access and input to the institutions'  operations.
The United States is the principal shareholder of the IMF and the World  Bank.
It is also the worst contributor, with its back payments to the  development banks reaching 847 million dollars.
