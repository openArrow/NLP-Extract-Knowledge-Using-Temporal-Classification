If the Juventus star is injured or fails to perform, it is difficult to  see where Italy's goals are going to come from.
Fortunately, there is little evidence that Baggio does anything other than  thrive under pressure.
Left out of Italy's first two games in 1990, the then 22-year-old  responded by scoring a superb individual goal against Czechoslovakia with a  superb solo run from the half-way line. His place in the national team has not  been in doubt since.
Along with Baggio, the other member of Sacchi's squad who would be an  automatic choice in any world XI is Franco Baresi.
The veteran AC Milan sweeper announced his retirement from international  football at the beginning of the 1992-93 season. But after a chaotic defensive  display nearly cost Italy a home defeat by Switzerland, Sacchi immediately got  on the phone to Baresi and persuaded him to make a comeback.
Alongside Baresi in defence, Milan also provide the stopper Alessandro  Costacurta and left back Paolo Maldini, an Italian international from the age  of 19.
Parma's Antonio Benarrivo completes a defensive quartet that will make the  Italians very hard to beat.
Ahead of Baggio, goalscoring responsibilities will fall on the slim  shoulders of Lazio's Guiseppe Signori and his teammate Pierluigi Casiraghi --  who represents the biggest gamble in Sacchi's selection.
Casiraghi spent much of the season on the bench while Signori was  partnered by the Croat Alen Boksic and Sacchi had to resist a lot of pressure  to include Torino's 17-goal Andrea Silenzi.
