The foreign ministers of Russia, the United States  and five western European countries called Friday for a four-month ceasefire  in Bosnia-Hercegovina and negotiations between the warring parties in two  weeks.
A communique issued at the end of their five-hour meeting called for a  peace agreement based on a European Union proposal to divide the former  Yugoslav republic on the basis of 51 percent for a federation of Moslems and  Croats, and 49 percent for Serbs.
The ministers from the United States, Russia, Germany, Britain, France,  Belgium and Greece also condemned recent Serb attacks against Gorazde, a  Moslem enclave in the east which the United Nations had declared a "safe area."
After two years of destruction and division leaving tens of thousands of  people dead, wounded or displaced, frustration at the failure of previous  peace proposals marked the run-up to this high-level encounter.
France and its west European partners were set on wresting agreement on a  ceasefire and political settlement formula.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, whose country has furnished the  largest contingent for UN forces in Bosnia, warned earlier that the UN forces  would not weather another winter there without such a plan.
The lower Russian house of parliament for its part voted Friday to no  longer adhere to the UN sanctions against the rump Yugoslavia of Serbia and  its tiny Montenegrin ally.
Friday's Duma resolution stipulated that in the event of a "unilateral  lifting by a state of the embargo on arms deliveries to Bosnia," Russia would  have to respond with "adequate measures that could go as far as raising the  question of a unilateral exit from the sanctions regime."
