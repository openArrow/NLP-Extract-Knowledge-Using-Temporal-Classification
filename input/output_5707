Alberto Salazar, whose  fanatical marathon training in the eighties nearly crippled him, won the 54  mile (86.7km) Comrades Marathon here Tuesday.
The American whose 1982 Boston marathon win in 2hr 8min 52sec made him one  of the fastest men for the 26mile (42km) classic distance, won his his  first-ever ultra-marathon in five hours 38 minutes 38 seconds.
He took the lead before the halfway mark and was never seriously  challenged by a field of more than 12,000 runners in the race from the coastal  port of Durban to this KwaZulu-Natal provincial capital.
However, the deeply-religious Salazar described his victory as a "miracle".
"I prayed for hours," Salazar said after crossing the finish line. "I was  hurting real bad during the race and I asked the Lord to help me to keep  going. I was in agony for long periods."
South Africans Nic Bester, in 5:42.51, and Mahlala Mohloli, in 5:43.14,  were second and third.
The first three places in the women's race went to athletes from the  Eastern Bloc.
Valentina Liakova won in 6:41.22 with fellow Russian Valentina Shatyaeva  second in 6:45.48 and Hungarian Marta Vass third in 6:51.03.
