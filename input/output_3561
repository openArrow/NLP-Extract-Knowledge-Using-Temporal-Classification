The no-hunting zone would also benefit the minke whale, which has replaced  the blue and humpbacked as a target of Japanese and Norwegian whalers.
In addition to commercial hunting, the whale is threatened by climatic  changes such as the destruction of the ozone layer protecting Earth from the  sun's ultraviolet rays.
Environmentalists hope that giving the giant mammals some sanctuary will  mean that numbers will grow, no mean feat considering that whales have a  gestation period estimated at eight to 13 months and take a long time to reach  adulthood.
