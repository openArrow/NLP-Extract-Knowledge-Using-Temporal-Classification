China is planning to import one trillion US  dollars in goods in the next seven years, a Chinese trade official said on  Monday.
Zheng Silin, vice minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, told  the opening of the Hong Kong '94 China Trade and Investment Conference that  imports were worth 104 billion dollars last year.
He said China's basic policy for foreign trade was to strike a balance  between imports and exports provided it had necessary foreign reserves.
China suffered a trade deficit of 12 billion dollars last year owing to  increases in import as a result of rapid economic development in China, Zheng  said, but it still ranks the 11th-largest trader in the world with a total  import and export value of 195.8 billion dollars last year.
Zheng said China's economic reforms would take full consideration of  foreign investors and were aimed at creating an investment climate in which  enterprises operated under international norms.
Meanwhile, Ma Xiuhong, vice director of foreign investment administration  in the foreign trade and economic cooperation ministry, said at the same forum  that China had approved up to 181,600 foreign investment projects, worth 234  billion dollars, as of February this year.
Actual foreign investment in China was 60 billion dollars in 170,000  enterprises, Ma said.
The four-day trade forum has attracted foreign businessmen and investors,  as well as business groups from 24 Chinese provinces and cities and four  ministerial trade entities.
It was sponsored by the China's ministry of foreign economic relations and  Hong Kong's quasi-official Hong Kong Trade and Development Council.
