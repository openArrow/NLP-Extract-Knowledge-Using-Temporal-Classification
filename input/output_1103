UN forces Monday intercepted a column of 10  Bosnian Croat tanks near Tomislavgrad, 70 kilometers (40 miles) west of  Sarajevo, and persuaded them to turn around and go back, a UN spokesman said.
The Soviet-made tanks were stopped by British UN peacekeepers in a  Croat-controlled area that is generally demilitarized under an agreement  reached in February calling for the creation of a Croat-Moslem federation in  Bosnia, spokesman Eric Chaperon said.
The tanks were headed north but it was not immediately known what their  intentions were, he said, adding that the tank commanders had claimed they  were unaware they had crossed into a demilitarised zone.
