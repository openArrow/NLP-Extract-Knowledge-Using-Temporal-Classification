US Secretary of State Warren Christopher went  into talks here Monday with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shara as the  official press called for a "quick" Israeli pullout from the strategic Golan  Heights.
Christopher was then expected to leave for Israel on his second peace  shuttle between the arch foes in as many weeks.
The US envoy held four hours of talks Sunday with President Hafez al-Assad.
The government Tishrin newspaper meanwhile said that the success of  Christopher's mission depended on an "immediate Israeli withdrawal from the  Golan according to a well defined timetable."
Tishrin on Sunday said Syria was willing to negotiate an Israeli  withdrawal from the Golan on condition Israel pledged a complete pullout  within an "acceptable and reasonable" timeframe.
Christopher was expected to deliver Israel's response to Assad's  counter-proposals, following an initial Israeli offer of a phased withdrawal  from the Golan.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has offered to return three of five  Druze villages on the heights as a first stage in a three-step withdrawal over  five-eight years from the plateau which Israel conquered in 1967.
Syria rejected the offer and was likely to turn down Israeli proposals  that Christopher try to persuade Damascus to set up a joint military  commission with Israel to "draft security arrangements" for the heights.
