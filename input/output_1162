France will slash its peacekeeping presence in the  former Yugoslavia from 6,000 troops to 4,500 soldiers by the end of the year,  Defense Minister Francois Leotard said Tuesday.
"We have begun a process of withdrawal of a certain number of battalions  we have there, first the one in Glina in Krajina (Serb-controlled territory in  Croatia) and then the one in Bihac" in northwest Bosnia, Leotard said in a  radio interview.
"Before the end of the year, there will be about 2,500 fewer French  soldiers on the territory of the former Yugoslavia," he said.
The move came after Foreign Minister Alain Juppe threatened to pull out  all French troops, who make up the largest contingent of the UN Protection  Force (UNPROFOR) in former Yugoslavia, if progress towards a peace settlement  was not made.
The French UN troops are deployed in both Croatia and Bosnia. There are  also French naval forces patrolling the Adriatic sea and French aircraft based  in Italy.
