The first session of South Africa's new  multi-racial parliament will begin next Tuesday, a day later than initially  planned, the domestic SAPA news agency reported Tuesday.
President Nelson Mandela will open the session, due to last until the  start of July, with a speech to both houses of parliament, which will then be  debated for a week by the members elected at the end of last month.
One of the highlights of the parliamentary session will the adoption of  the budget on June 22, SAPA said.
The National Assembly, in which the African National Congress (ANC) has  252 of the 400 seats, held its inaugural session on May 9, when it elected  Mandela head of state. It also elected its speaker, Frene Ginwala of the ANC.
The Senate is due to hold its inaugural sitting on Friday. Its 90 members  are currently being chosen by South Africa's nine provincial assemblies, which  will each send 10 senators.
The ANC will hold a large majority in the Senate, but the only candidate  so far put up as speaker is National Party member Kobie Coetsee, former  justice minister in the last white minority government.
Together, the National Assembly and the Senate will form a constituent  assembly that will draw up a definitive South African constitution.
