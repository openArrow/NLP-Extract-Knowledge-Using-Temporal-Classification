Bryan Young hit a fine 90 to inspire  a long-awaited New Zealand victory against Northamptonshire here on Sunday.
Opener Young set up an eight-wicket victory to erase a week of poor  batting performances by the Kiwis --  and boost morale before the one-day  international series against England.
Manager Geoff Howarth's demand -- "We've got to toughen up and start  producing the goods" -- seemed to work after the tourists, without a win in  four previous games against county opposition, promoted former skipper Martin  Crowe to opener.
He (31), Young and wicketkeeper Adam Parore (60 not out) all took  advantage of West Indian paceman Curtly Ambrose's absence to set up a victory  with over ten overs to spare.
Young, without a half century in his six previous tour innings, blossomed  after a gentle start. He struck ten boundaries before edging a catch behind  off Mark Bowen when only two runs were wanted for victory in the 50-over match.
Crowe may well find himself opening again in Thursday's first one-day  international at Edgbaston.
And if New Zealand can bowl and field as tightly in Birmingham, England  will find themselves facing a real challenge.
The Kiwis restricted Northants to 188 for five.
Brilliant catches by Young -- at slip, to remove Alan Fordham -- and Simon  Fleming -- at long off when Mal Loye tried to hit out -- left the home team  needing Tony Penberthy's unbeaten 47 to achieve respectability.
