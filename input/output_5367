Pope John Paul II has issued a firm "no" to  the ordination of women as priests in one of his sternest and shortest rulings  as pope, according to a copy of the document released Monday.
In his ruling, dated May 22 and sent to bishops worldwide, the pope said:  "So that there is no doubt on a question of great importance, I declare,...  that the church has no power whatsoever to ordain women and that this decision  must be firmly followed by all members of the church."
The pope added that he was surprised that while the tradition of only  ordaining men as priests has been followed by the church, some believed the  issue was open to debate.
He also recounted the controversy that erupted between the Anglican and  Catholic church after Pope Paul VI wrote a letter to the Archbishop of  Canterbury, Donald Coggan, in 1975 reminding the latter of the Vatican's  position on the issue.
The Anglican Church of England began ordaining women priests this year  prompting strong criticism by the Catholic church and several Anglican priests  who vowed to become Catholic.
Among the arguments presented by the pope to support his decision is the  fact that the Virgin Mary was not indoctrinated into the priesthood which  "clearly shows that the non-admission of women into the priesthood does not  mean they have less dignity or that they are being discriminated against.
"But it is the faithful adherance to an arrangement one must attribute to  the wisdom of the lord of the universe."
The pope added that women's role in everyday life and the church, while  not linked to the priesthood, still was necessary and irreplacable.
