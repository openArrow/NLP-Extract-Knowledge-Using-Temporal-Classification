Maguire, 50, told AFP in a telephone interview from an airport detention  office that "we were just informed that we would be excluded from the country,  and we would now be returning to our own country."
"We were aware that we would be deported but we tried to go to the  conference. We decided that we would come because we feel the need for  solidarity with the suffering people of East Timor."
