Prices on the London Metals Exchange (LME) closed  generally higher on Friday, lifting as lower copper stocks encouraged  investors once again, traders said.
Weekly stocks on the LME fell an encouraging 12,725 tonnes to 387,000  tonnes, pushing copper up 18 dollars to close at 2,265 dollars per tonne.  Dealers said some Chinese buying also helped prices.
"We saw a bit of a jump on the kerb and away we went again, pulling most  of the other metals higher, although nickel remained under pressure," said one  trader.
Nickel closed 55 dollars lower at 6,430 dollars per tonne, as the market  focused almost exclusively on the May 31 deadline for a new labour contract at  Canadian producer Inco's Sudbury, Ontario division.
"A strike is now 75-80 percent factored into the price," said one trader.  "If we see a strike at Inco, I would look to see a quick knee-jerk reaction  but if there is not a strike, nickel could look very vulnerable to  disappointed long selling."
Zinc was 15.5 dollars higher at 987 dollars per tonne, despite news that  Germany's Metallgesellschaft will dramatically restructure its refined metals  activities.
The Duisberg tin smelter, an operational facility of "Berzelius" Stolberg  GmbH and CO, will be closed while the output of Ruhr-Zink's Datteln zinc  smelter will be slashed from 200,000 tonnes per year to 90,000 tonnes per year.
Lead closed 22.5 dollars higher at 987 dollars per tonne, while aluminium  was up 11 dollars at 1,362 dollars per tonne and tin was up 65 dollars at  5,665 dollars per tonne.
