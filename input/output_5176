World number one cyclist Miguel Indurain   slumped to a shock defeat in the Tour of Italy here on Sunday as he was  crushed in his favourite time-trial discipline.
Indurain, regarded as almost unbeatable in solo rides, could only finish  fourth, two minutes and 34sec behind as overall leader Evgeni Berzin of Russia  underlined his dominance during the 44km eight stage.
That result may well mean the end of the Spaniard's hopes of clinching a  hat-trick of Giro titles -- and must also throw into doubt his hopes of  winning his fourth consecutive Tour de France title.
He said: "I had a bad day, but it's still a three-week race."
The 24-year-old Berzin, winner of the Liege-Bastogne-Liege classic earlier  this year, clocked 50min 46sec to beat Frenchman Armand de las Cuevas by 1:16  on the stage between Grosseto and Follonica, with Italian Gianni Bugno coming  third, 1:41 behind.
The margin of Indurain's defeat, which left him over three-and-a-half  minutes off the overall pace, was astonishing.
He has based his major tour victories on time-trial domination and then  defensive riding. The Spaniard won his last two Tour de France without winning  a single stage outside the time trials.
The 29-year-old Indurain's 1994 season was disrupted in March by a pollen  allergy which forced him to miss the Criterium International and he then  injured a muscle in his right thigh just above knee and pulled out of April's  Liege-Bastogne-Liege classic -- a race Berzin went on to win.
He did, howeve, return to win the Tour de l'Oise at Senlis, France, in May.
