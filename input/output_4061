The International Monetary Fund said Wednesday  it had awarded a loan of 181 million dollars to Jordan to assist its program  of structural economic reform begun in 1990.
The IMF said the loan is aimed at helping the program, which was  intensified in 1992, to reduce Jordan's balance of payments and its budget  deficit.
