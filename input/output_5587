Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. and Ford Motor Co. of the  United States will agree to jointly develop subcompact cars for the worldwide  market, a Japanese business daily reported Tuesday.
Mazda and Ford, which is the biggest shareholder of the Japanese carmaker,  are expected to reach basic agreements on the project in June and start  development by December, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said.
They are to develop cars possibly based on Mazda's Familia model, one of  Mazda's best-selling cars, with world-wide sales of 700,000 units last year.  Ford sells the model as well under its own brand name in the United States and  Asian nations.
Mazda and Ford plan to start production of a new subcompact car in 1998 or  1999 at their plants in Japan, the United States and Europe, the newspaper  said.
The daily said the joint project, aimed to cut production costs by  expanding the scale of output, is part of their mutual strategy for the world  market.
Last year, Mazda, 24.5 percent owned by Ford, failed to reach an agreement  on a European based joint venture with the US carmaker.
But Mazda said in January that it was prepared to reopen to negotiations  with Ford on joint production of cars for the European market.
