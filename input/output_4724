Austria's eleventh-seeded Thomas Muster, who put twice-finalist Andre  Agassi out of the event in the previous round, was beaten 4-6, 7-5, 3-6, 3-6  by exciting Australian 'serve-and-volley' player Patrick Rafter
And Mikael Tillstrom, a qualifier who has never featured in the world's  top-100, continued his remarkable 'giant-killing' progress at the event by  defeating sixteenth-seed Richard Krajicek in straight-sets.
The 24-year-old Swede, a left-hander who is playing in his first-ever  Grand Slam event, raced to a 7-6 (7/4) 6-2, 6-3 victory.
Currently ranked 226th by the ATP computer, the Gothenburg player had to  compete in last week's strenuous qualifying tournament to reach the main draw  and his highest-ever ranking remains 117th -- achieved two years ago.
Krajicek, a 6ft 5in (Im96) Dutch giant who reached the semi-finals twelve  months ago, won his fifth career title at Barcelona this year after several  months absence because of tendinitis of the knee.
Tillstrom now plays world number-one Pete Sampras for a place in the  quarter-finals.
The American moved one-step closer to a potentially explosive  quarter-final duel against twice-champion Jim Courier.
It was just like the old days for Courier who was always in charge against  Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman.
Bjorkman didn't know what hit him as the 1991 and 1992 champion blasted  home his winners for a 6-3, 6-1, 6-1 victory in just 1hr 48min.
Sampras, serving better than he has since the tournament began last  Monday, disposed of Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands for the loss of just six  games.
