The only time it does not come off is when another side copy the Irish by  continuously bombing in the ball behind the opposition full-backs and  pressurising them -- as the Danes did in a 1-1 draw in Dublin -- or launch  swift counter-attacks, as the Spaniards did in their 3-1 triumph here.
Concerns about an ageing defence have been assuaged by the emergence of  Coventry central defender Phil Babb as a quality performer. Leeds fullback  Gary Kelly is another youngster who has made a late bid to force his way into  the side to face Italy in Ireland's opening match against Italy in New York --  a clash that promises to be one of the great occasions of the World Cup.
Goalkeeper Packie Bonner is no longer the figure of authority who starred  in the penalty shoot-out against Romania three years ago and really should  have been ousted by Alan Kelly during the qualifiers.
McGrath's knee operations seem to be catching up with him, judging by his  reduced mobility, while his central defensive partner, Kevin Moran, is no  speed merchant either and at 37 will not get any quicker.
In midfield Ray Houghton is not as creative as he used to be, while up  front John Aldridge's once-prolific scoring touch has dimmed.
harlton also faces the problem of finding a replacement for injured  beanpole striker Niall Quinn.
The Manchester City player, who has been the fulcrum of the Republic's  attack for so long, looks certain to miss out.
But Motherwell's Tommy Coyne, an outstanding performer against the Dutch  and Quinn's likely replacement, has done well since being given a regular  place in the side
And in Manchester United's Roy Keane, Aston Villa's Andy Townsend and  Sheffield Wednesday's John Sheridan, the Irish can call on a trio of  midfielders to rival any side in the finals.
If the Irish do fail in New York, it won't be for lack of preparation.  After the Holland clash, they have friendlies with Bolivia and Germany  programmed.
