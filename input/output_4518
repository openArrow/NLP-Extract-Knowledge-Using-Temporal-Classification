China plans to boost its capacity of nuclear power  generation to 300 million-to-350 million kilowatts by 2050 to cope with its  rapid economic growth, the Yomiuri newspaper reported Friday.
The nuclear power output will be nine times the current capacity of Japan  and three times that of the United States, the report said.
The plan was unveiled by Zhao Renkai, vice president of China's commission  of science and technoloy, at a meeting of the Pacific Basin Nuclear Conference  in Sydney earlier this month, it said.
China needs to build nuclear power plants to meet growing demand for  electricity, replacing coal-burning thermal power plants which account for 80  percent of power generation.
Yomiuri said experts had been calling for crossborder cooperation to  ensure safey at China's nuclear plants.
China would require 4.6 trillion-to-9.3 trillion kilowatt-hours of  electricity toward the year 2030 and 8.6 trillion-to-22.4 trillion  kilowatt-hours toward 2050 to power China's economy, which is estimated to be  growing at an annual rate of six-to-nine percent.
China has three nuclear power plants, with a total capacity of 2.1 million  kilowatts, and is planning to build four more, Yomiuri said.
Japan has assisted in development of nuclear power plants in China for  seven years. Earlier this month the Japanese government reached an agreement  with Beijing on safety in nuclear development.
