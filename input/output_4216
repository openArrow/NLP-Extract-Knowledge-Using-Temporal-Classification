Vanuatu opposition parties tried to pass a  no-confidence motion Thursday but were ruled out of order by the parliament's  speaker.
Speaker Alfred Masing said the motion was not in order because the  constitution stipulated that at least one week's notice must be given and the  required seven days had not expired.
Masing closed parliament and said the motion would be in order at the next  available time slot on Tuesday.
All four opposition parties, however, insisted notice of the motion had  been hand-delivered to Masing on May 18, with one party saying it had a copy  of the motion bearing the speaker's stamp with that date.
Opposition sources said the 14-point no-confidence motion accused Prime  Minister Maxime Carlot and his government of being "incapable of managing and  managing the affairs of the state."
