German air carrier Lufthansa said  Monday it cut its net losses to 92 billion marks (55 billion dollars) in 1993,  against 391 millions the previous year, and announced moves to raise its  capital.
The state-controlled concern, which is earmarked for a gradual full  privatisation, announced that its supervisory board would recommend an  increase in nominal capital of 565 billion marks to a July 6 shareholders'  meeting.
Lufthansa also announced it planned to take a 38 percent share in the  Swissair enterprise Business Air. A spokesman said the price would be "under  50 million marks".
The German airline's freight and passenger traffic both rose during 1993,  pushing turnover up 2.9 percent to 17.7 billion marks for the carrier.
The government, which currently holds 51.42 percent of Lufthansa capital,  has already said it will not subscribe to the new rights issue in line with  its plan to relinquish control and eventually to fully privatise the line.
Lufthansa said ticket sales rose 5.7 percent and freight traffic by 5.5  percent last year, when it carried 35.6 million passengers and 1.1 million  tonnes of freight.
Investment fell from 2.7 billion marks in 1992 to 1.7 billions.
In the first quarter of 1994, the group registered a pre-tax loss of 82  million marks, against 245 millions for the first quarter of last year, on a  turnover of 3.6 billions which was up 11.5 percent.
Management attributed the reduction in first quarter losses to a policy of  cuts and flexibility reducing labour costs by five percent.
While the number of passengers fell 1.6 percent to 6.6 millions in the  first quarter, the passenger per kilometre ratio increased by five percent and  freight was up 14.5 percent to 314,000 tonnes.
Sales in 1994 are expected to be up five percent.
Under the proposed rights issue, shares are expected to be offered at 20  percent below current stock market quotation, or at about 170 marks each,  which would raise 1.8 billion marks if the issue were entirely subscribed.
By virtue of the government not taking up its share, the state holding  would fall to 38 percent.
Lufthansa staff are to be offered a nominal 50 millions worth of the new  shares.
