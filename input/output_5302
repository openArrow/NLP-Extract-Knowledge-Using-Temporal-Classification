South African soccer hero "Doctor" Khumalo may face  suspension from the first international against Australia in Adelaide on  Wednesday week.
Khumalo was sent off 13 minutes from the end of South Africa's 2-1 win  over Zambia in Johannesburg this month and the Australian Soccer Federation is  waiting on a decision from the world body FIFA.
"He is a colourful and key player for the South Africans but there are a  number of young players with plenty of potential to fill his attacking role,"  said ASF spokesman John Warren here Monday.
It will be the first major overseas series for the South Africans,  although they played against Mexico in Los Angeles last October, losing 4-0.
Australia and South Africa, who last met in 1955, will play the first  international in Adelaide on June 8 and the return match at the Sydney  Football Stadium on June 12.
"South Africa has played 19 internationals in the past two years and is  desperate for more top class competition to help build for the future," said  Warren.
