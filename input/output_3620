Polish war veterans seeking to join next month's  ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of D-Day will have to pay and organise  their own way to Normandy, the Warsaw veterans' association said here Tuesday.
Organisation chairman Zygmunt Korwin-Sokolowski said the Polish veterans,  who fought alongside the Allies in the June 6, 1944 landings, had not be been  officially invited to the commemoration by France.
He added that only 90 people were planning to make the trip, notably  former troops of the First Armoured Division under General Stanislaw Maczek  who participated in the battle for Falaise, Normandy.
Korwin-Sokolowski told journalists that the veterans were angered mainly  by what they see as the failure by Polish authorities to secure places for  some of their comrades in the official Polish delegation to the ceremonies to  be led by President Lech Walesa.
The news is the latest in a series of setbacks this year for Poland's  World War II fighters.
Earlier in 1994 ceremonies to mark the 50th anniversary of the key battle  for Monte Cassino, Italy, in which Polish troops also fought alongside Allied  forces, were marred by bad local organisation blamed on the government and  travel agencies.
And tensions have risen over the forthcoming August 1 anniversary of the  Warsaw Insurrection, at which veterans have said they will refuse to march  past the German and Russian presidents, who have both been invited to the  event.
