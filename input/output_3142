Tenth-seed Boris Becker, who had been hoping to win  the only major title that has always eluded him, was forced out of the French  Open here on Monday after an injury in training.
The 26-year-old three-times Wimbledon champion, who was finalist at the  Italian Open two weeks ago, strained a back muscle in training for his first  round match against American Jonathan Stark.
His place in the draw was taken by lucky loser Brent Larkham of Australia.
Becker had been seeded to play seventh-seeded American and twice champion  Jim Courier in the fourth round.
