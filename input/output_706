Illingworth added: "We discussed four or five other seamers, another four  batsmen and three more slow bowlers.
"What we've settled for is a squad we think can win the one-dayers. It is  important for us to start winning matches because that will do everyone's  confidence some good.
"But these people are playing for their Test futures as well. All of them  can enhance their prospects."
Dermot Reeve is unlikely to make the Test squad but his batting and  medium-paced bowling, as well as his enthusisasm in the field, continue to be  key elements in England's one-day strategy.
Pace bowlers Devon Malcolm and Andy Caddick, however, look sure to return  to the front-line for the Test series.
