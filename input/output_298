stable. Aluminium dropped around three dollars during the week  from the previous Friday close of 1,332 dollars per tonne.
Aluminium moved little during the week, largely on lack of news and as the  record rise of copper scooped dealers attention.
The US Aluminium Industry repored a 14 percent fall in US primary  aluminium output in April to 269,450 tonnes from 313.250 tonnes a year ago. On  an annualised basis this is an output cut of 525,600 tonnes.
It was also reported that Alcan had taken delivery of the first Aluminium  Intensive Vehicle AIV, jointly developed by the firm and Ford for consumer  testing.
The vehicle is said to be identical to the normal steelbodied Sable, but  weighs 400 lbs less as a result of the extensive use of aluminium in the  structure and exterior panels.
Stocks on the LME rose a further 17,625 tonnes to a record 2,646,675  tonnes.
NICKEL: sharply higher. Nickel soared higher to a three month high since  February 24, lifting 165 dollars over the week to the Thursday close of 5,940  dollars per tonne.
During the day on Thursday, the metal soared a massive 115 dollars on  expectations that workers at Canadian producer Inco's Sudbury, Ontario  division, would vote later to give their union a strike mandate in current  labour labour talks.
This mandate was granted late Thursday, local time in Canada, with a total  of 93.5 percent of voting members in favour of authorising the union to take  strike action if it is deemed necessary.
The current labor contract at Sudbury is set to expire at the end of this  month. The market believes Inco has only enough stocks to continue nickel  deliveries for three weeks in the event of industrial action.
The Sudbury divison produces an average of approximately 20 million pounds  of refined nickel per month. It is producing less this month because one of  the division's two flash furnaces broke down last Friday, also lifting prices.
The company then said it would replace the furnace within a week, and that  the incident would not have any significant impact on its 1994 production  targets.
Weekly stocks on the LME fell 432 tonnes to 132,516 tonnes.
TIN: lower. Tin fell around 60 dollars during the week, from the previous  Friday close of 5,505 dollars per tonne.
