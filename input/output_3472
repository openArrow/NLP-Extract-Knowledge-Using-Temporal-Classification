The British retail chain Marks and Spencer on  Tuesday announced a 15.6 percent rise in annual pre-tax profits at 851 million  pounds (1.277 billion dollars) from 736.5 million pounds the previous year.
The results, to the end of March, were less than analysts' expectations of  between 860 and 880 million pounds.
Sales lifted 10 percent to 6.54 billion pounds from 5.95 billion pounds  the previous year.
The dividend was up at 9.2 pence from 8.1, while earnings per share rose  to 20.9 pence from 18 pence.
The company said its business had performed strongly throughout the  British recession, but added: "looking ahead, we have yet to test the strength  of recovery in comsumer confidence."
It said the recession in continental Europe was continuing with  "competition in all the areas in which we trade ... likely to remain intense,"  but added that Marks and Spencers was looking forward to "another year of  solid progress."
Shares lost six pence to 419 on the London stock exchange shortly after  the results.
