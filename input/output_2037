The political crisis in Bulgaria deepened Thursday  as the government warned it would resign unless parliament supported a  proposed cabinet reshuffle and a general strike threatened to paralyze the  country.
Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeni Matinchev warned that the centrist  government would resign unless a compromise was reached with groups in  parliament opposed to a government reshuffle.
The reshuffle was announced Wednesday by Prime Minister Luben Berov in  response to criticism, mainly by the anti-communist Union of Democratic Forces  (UDF), that his current cabinet was "inefficient."
Berov laster Thursday faces a no-confidence vote called by the UDF.
The formerly communist Socialist Party and the Movement for Rights and  Freedom, which represents the country's Turkish minority, are opposed to the  proposed reshuffle on the grounds that it was inspired by the UDF. The two  parties are also opposed to the appointment of a socialist, the economist  Romen Gechev as deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation.
Meanwhile some 200,000 people answered a call for a general strike  Thursday organised by the Independent Unions, one of the country's main  unions, to protest social policies and deteriorating living standards due to a  devaluation of the Bulgarian currency, the lev.
The strike affected the education, health, light industry, military and  mining sectors.
Demonstrations were also planned in front of the parliament building and  at the Kozlodui nuclear power plant.
The strike is expected to continue through Friday and then resume  Wednesday due to the upcoming holiday weekend.
Krastio Petkov, leader of the Independent Unions, said Wednesday he would  only call off the strike if parliament gave "guarantees" compensating for the  dip in workers' standards of living in recent months, and on stabilising the  lev whose value has slipped since the beginning of the year.
