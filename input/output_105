The navies of Japan and South Korea will hold their   first exercises together when they take part in US-led "Rimpac" maneuvers in  the Pacific Ocean from May 26, the Defense Ministry announced Friday.
This will be South Korea's third time participating in the biennial  exercise, "Rimpac," since 1990, but its first time conducting maritime  exercises with Japan, a ministry spokesman said.
The exercises will be staged in the West and Mid-Pacific region from May  26 through July 16 by the navies of the United States, Australia, Canada,  Japan and South Korea to secure maritime transportation routes and promote  combined operational capabilities, he said.
South Korea will send two escort destroyers and 360 men for the maneuvers,  which involve two aircraft carriers, 58 other vessels, 200 aircraft and 25,000  crew members, he said.
The United States, Japan and South Korea will jointly conduct  "offensive-defensive battle maneuvers," including gunfire exercises and guided  missile and torpedo firing, the ministry said.
In the three-nation exercise, however, US vessels will form two separate   training units, one with South Korea and another with Japan because Japan's  post-war constitution allows it to take part in international exercises only  within the framework of its bilateral security pact with Washington, it said.
US ships will also lead a second task force with Canada and Australia, the  ministry said, without elaborating on the schedule.
