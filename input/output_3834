French President Francois Mitterrand  pardoned a jailed AIDS victim after 200 fellow prisoners wrote to the head of  state pleading he be allowed to "die with dignity," the prison chaplain said  in this western city on Wednesday.
The 42-year-old man, identified as Gerard X, has been taken in by  protestant chaplain Bernard Delepine, who said "common sense has prevailed. It  is just so a dying man can live out his last days in the way he wants."
Gerard was serving a 10-year sentence for armed robbery.
A first application for a pardon was rejected ten days ago by the ministry  of justice. It was then that Gerard's fellow prisoners wrote to Mitterrand.
The ill man was freed on Tuesday and taken in by Delepine, who is married  with four children.
