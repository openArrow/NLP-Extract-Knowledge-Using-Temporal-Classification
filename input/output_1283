Canada's composite index, the main indicator for  likely economic growth, advanced 0.6 percent in April, a slight decline from  its 0.7 percent growth in March, the government reported Tuesday.
Statistics Canada blamed the easing of the index's growth to the April  decline in stock market prices.
"The other nine components (of the index) showed few signs that the recent  slump in financial markets has had an impact on the rest of the economy," the  government agency said. "The April rate of increase was about equal to the  average growth recorded in the last year and a half."
Statistics Canada noted that household demand was positive, consumer  confidence had been buoyed by the growth of jobs in February and March, and  "nearly non-existent inflation boosted real wages."
