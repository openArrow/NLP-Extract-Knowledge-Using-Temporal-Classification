North Korea seized on the 14th anniverary of the   bloody popular uprising in the South Korean city of Kwangju Wednesday to  demand the withdrawal of US troops from Korea and the ouster of the government  in Seoul.
Some 10,000 people, including Vice President Pak Song-Chol, Vice Premier  Jang Chol and other officials, and citizens and Koreans from abroad, rallied  at the Pyongyang Indoor Stadium, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.
Pyongyang Mayor Kang Hyon-Su told the rally the South Koreans had learned  through the 1980 incident that "US imperialism is the strangler of  independence and democracy," according to the official news agency monitored  here.
Kang also denounced South Korean President Kim Yong-Sam as a "traitor"  whose presence would lead to "confrontation and war between fellow countrymen."
Martial law troops crushed the Kwangju riot, leaving more than 200 dead  according to official accounts. The United States, with command control over  South Korean forces, has been held partly responsible for the bloodbath.
Kang urged the United States to pull out its troops and "nuclear weapons"  from South Korea and promote talks with North Korea "for a peaceful solution"  to the nuclear standoff on the Korean peninsula.
He also called on South Koreans to "courageously fight to overthrow the  Kim Young Sam puppet regime and establish a genuine independent democratic  government of the people."
