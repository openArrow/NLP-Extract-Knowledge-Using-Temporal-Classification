UN peacekeepers due to be sent back to Rwanda will  be powerless to staunch ethnic bloodletting unless they deploy speedily with  armoured vehicles and helicopters, a UN official warned Tuesday.
Abdul Kabia, head of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda, welcomed the UN  Security Council's decision to deploy 5,500 soldiers in stages.
"But we appeal to the international community to provide proper military  equipment immediately," Kabia told AFP by telephone from Kigali, the Rwandan  capital.
The UN decided to send peacekeepers back to Rwanda after coming under  heavy criticism for withdrawing all but 400 of its 2,500 ceasefire monitors  when an ethnic bloodbath engulfed the country after the April 6 death of  president Juvenal Habyarimana in a mysterious plane crash.
Relief officials estimate that more than 200,000 Rwandans have been  butchered while the United Nations has done little more than make verbal  protests.
The new force will not intervene in fighting between the rebel Rwanda  Patriotic Front (RPF) and the army, but may use force to protect civilians  being massacred by civilian militias controlled only loosely, if at all, by  the government, Kabia said.
Both the army and the rebels, who had earlier warned that they would treat  a "military intervention force" as a hostile invasion, have agreed to the  phased deployment of the new UN force, Kabia said.
"This is not an intervention force to stop fighting between the two sides,  that will be a political effort," he said. "Both sides have given their  agreement and we are counting on their cooperation. The problem we may have is  with the militias but we can handle that provided we have the right resources."
The UN troops will escort convoys of food and medicine to hundreds of  thousands of Rwandans threatened by famine and disease and will help protect  civilians and displaced people.
