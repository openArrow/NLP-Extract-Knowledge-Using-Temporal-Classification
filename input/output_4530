Prisoners from three notorious prisons closed  Saturday by new president Bakili Muluzi have been transferred to other prisons.
The Daily Times -- owned by ex-president Hastings Kamuzu Banda -- reported  Friday that inmates of Mikuyu in Zomba, Dzaleka in Dowa and Nsanje had been  transferred.
Muluzi said the three prisons were associated with the former regime's  record of abuse of human rights.
He also commuted deaths sentences to life imprisonment and allowed  international human rights bodies to visit the prisons without hindrance.
Whiskes Mwale, chief inspector of prisons was quoted by the daily saying:  "we have already transferred 98 prisoners whose deaths sentences were commuted  to life imprisonment from Mikuyu to Zomba central prison."
Mwale said 34 convicted prisoners and eight remandees were transferred  from Dzaleka in Dowa to prisons in Kasungu and Lilongwe districts of central  Malawi.
"We had no political detainees when we were closing," he is said to have  told journalists after touring the 201-hectare (500-acre) prison farm, the  worst feared for its torture of prisoners, most of whom did not survive.
Dzaleka, which literally means "I'll stop being a criminal," was  established by ex-president Banda to punish political detainees.
Elton Singini, solicitor general and secretary for justice said the  government would discuss the situation and advise Muluzi on what the three  prisons could be used for.
