South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo arrived  Sunday in Cairo to become his country's first representative to take part in a  meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).
Nzo told the press on his arrival that his country "hopes to develop its  relations with Egypt and the Arab world" when the meeting opens on Tuesday.
Nzo was appointed as South Africa's foreign minister after April's  historic all-race elections which finally ended the apartheid system.
He added South Africa "was working to reconstruct and eliminate the  negative repercussions of the politics of apartheid."
Eighty-five countries are sending their foreign ministers to the Egyptian  capital for the four-day conference during which they will discuss the wars  raging in Yemen, Rwanda and Bosnia.
