Two men, both English, were convicted Friday and  jailed for 30 years each for their part in an Irish Republican Army (IRA)  bombing campaign that included last year's huge blast at Harrod's department  store in central London.
"You are both evil men whose business is terror, death and destruction,"  Judge Anthony Hidden told former army corporal Jan Taylor, 51, and computer  expert Patrick Hayes, 41.
Both men were convicted of the explosion in a litter bin outside Harrod's  in January last year, in which four people were injured, and a blast on a  train the following month, which led to massive damage.
They had been caught in the act of placing the Harrod's and other bombs by  security video cameras.
Both were also convicted of possession of semtex and other explosives and  firearms.
Hayes was additionally found guilty of plotting to cause explosions at  Canary Wharf, Tottenham Court Road and Woodside Park Tube station, all in  London, in 1992.
Both men smirked and nudged one another as the judge told them, "It is  only by the greatest good fortune no lives were lost.
"You both go about the business of terrorism with no thought for the lives  and limbs of members of the public and no concern for the massive destruction  you set out to unleash and the terror you seek to instill," he said.
Hayes and Taylor left the dock waving clenched fists and shouting, "Up the  IRA" (Republican Army) and a Gaelic slogan meaning, "Our time will come."
