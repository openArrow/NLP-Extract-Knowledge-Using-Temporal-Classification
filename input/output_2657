Chinese authorities have closed down four stock  market-related journals in Shanghai for operating illegally, an official from  the Shanghai Press and Publications Bureau said Saturday.
The official said Shanghai Stock Information, Shanghai Stock Exchange  News, Shanghai Stock Express and Caitong weekly, had been fined and closed  down recently, but declined to give further details.
"The main reason that they were banned is that these newspapers did not  register with the authorities -- that means they were illegal publications,"  the spokesman said.
The China Daily said Saturday that inspectors raided a publishing house in  Shanghai and confiscated 100,000 copies of the three daily newspapers and  7,000 copies of the weekly.
It said the four papers had circulated widely, particularly among stock  traders, adding that illegal publications had mushroomed since Shanghai opened  its stock exchange, spreading false information and causing disorder at the  exchange.
The clampdown comes as the authorities seek ways to breathe new life into  China's two stock exchanges -- in Shanghai and Shenzhen -- as the frenzied  demand that fueled the markets in their early days gives way to low turnover  and fears of a wholesale crash.
The Shanghai exchange opened in late 1990, followed by the Shenzhen market  in June 1991.
The Shanghai Stock Exchange News, run by a finance and economics  university, has published one million copies of 39 issues in the past six  months, while the Shanghai Stock Information, operated by a research  institute, has printed 27 issues of 1.09 million copies within four months,  the report said.
All the publications carried out their transactions in cash and used  unregistered newspaper peddlers for distribution and sales, it said.
