Chinese officials are grossly underestimating  the performance of the Chinese economy, a Japanese corporate leader said on  Tuesday.
"Official Chinese statistics place the country's GDP (gross domestic  product) at about 500 billion dollars in fiscal 1993 but this understates what  is actually happening," Minoru Murofushi, president and chief executive of  Tokyo's Itochu Corp, said.
"If calculations are based on purchasing-power parities, and tertiary  industries are included, the GDP (for 1993) is actually between two and 2.5  times that figure or roughly 1-to-1.3 trillion dollars," Morufushi said.
The Japanese entrepreneur, who said he has cultivated a number of personal  as well as business relationships in China to gain "some insights into events  there", was addressing Pacific businessmen and trade officials here.
Morufushi said he estimated China's current per capita annual GDP to be  about 1,000 dollars, adding that until 1995, the country's monetary, fiscal,  tax, trade and foreign exchange policies were expected to undergo severe  trials.
"The period from 1996 to the early part of the next century will see China  laying the foundation for remarkable development," Morufushi said, adding that  a minimum 10-percent growth was expected, with inflation below 10 percent.
Morufushi said he also expected China to form stronger ties with Vietnam,  Thailand and Burma and become a founding member of the evolving World Trade  Organisation.
