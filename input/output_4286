Japan's biggest food company, Ajinomoto Co. Inc.,  said on Thursday that its group pre-tax earnings fell 15.6 percent to 23.5  billion yen (228 million dollars) in the year to March and forecast a flat  year ahead.
The company, known throughout Asia for its monosodium glutamate (MSG) food  seasoning, said consolidated sales fell almost two percent to 675 billion yen.
Ajinomoto forecast a flat performance for the current year with earnings  rising marginally to 24 billion yen despite increased sales of 700 billion yen.
"The company attributes the reduced profit largely to the economic  recession, the sharp rise in the value of the yen and the stagnation of the  beverage business," a statement said.
"The increase in consumer-price consciousness and the lack of growth in  demand for food products for restaurant use placed strains on the food  industry. Furthermore, the cold and uncommonly rainy summer adversely affected  demand for products, such as beverages," it added.
"Later in the year, a shortage of domestically-grown rice had a negative  impact on food products utilising rice," it added.
