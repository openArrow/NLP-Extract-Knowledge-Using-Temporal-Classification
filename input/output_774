American Don Janicki and Ukrainian Lyubov  Klochko retained their titles in the Cleveland Marathon here Sunday, but rain  prevented a repeat of Janicki's 1993 record-setting exploits.
His time of 2 hours 15 minutes 4 seconds was well outside the course  record of 2:11:39 set last year. He was one minute in front of runner-up John  Kagwe of Kenya.
"I came here to defend my title and I'm happy I was able to do that,"  Janicki said. "I was never so nervous before a race as I was for this one."
Klochko won her third straight Cleveland title in 2:36:13. She pulled away  from Hungarian Karolina Szabo with about three miles left and won by more than  two minutes.
Kenya's Yobes Ondieki won the men's 10-km in 28:30, adding a third title  to the ones he won in 1989 and 1990. American Nadia Prasad won the women's  10-km in 32:01.
