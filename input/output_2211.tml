<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><TimeML><TIMEX3 tid="t0" functionInDocument="CREATION_TIME"/>Greece, torchbearers of the Olympic Games, have <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">cast</EVENT>  aside their country's traditional sporting ideals on the run-up to the World  Cup -- for money.&#13;
The Greek players are <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">celebrating</EVENT> their first World Cup finals, but  financial gain, as in most other countries, has <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">outweighed</EVENT> their historical  Olympic ethos.&#13;
The pure amateurism of Pierre de Coubertin's founding Games in Athens in  <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE">1896</TIMEX3> has <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">given</EVENT> way to the fast buck in <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE">recent Olympics</TIMEX3>.&#13;
And Greek footballers have similar financial aims. Though it is  understandable they are <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">looking</EVENT> after themselves, ancient Greeks might have  <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="might">winced</EVENT> at their demands.&#13;
<EVENT eid="e7" class="REPORTING" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">According</EVENT> to Athens daily newspaper Ta Nea, the players <EVENT eid="e8" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">want</EVENT> 12,400  dollars for each win, 6,150 dollars for draws, and 62,000 dollars for <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">reaching</EVENT>  the second phase.&#13;
Furthermore, they are <EVENT eid="e10" class="I_ACTION" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">claiming</EVENT> another 25 per cent of the revenue their  federation will <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="FUTURE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">receive</EVENT> from television rights and FIFA subsidies.&#13;
A 1-1 draw in Russia on <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE">May 23</TIMEX3> was enough to <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">make</EVENT> Greece the first country  to <EVENT eid="e13" class="I_STATE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">qualify</EVENT> for the World Cup in the United States.&#13;
However, with coach Alketas Panagoulias <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">caught</EVENT> between the two stools of  federation and players, friction within the camp may <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="may">hinder</EVENT> their preparation.&#13;
The federation's total income is likely to <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">exceed</EVENT> four million dollars,  and the players may reportedly <EVENT eid="e17" class="I_ACTION" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="may">ask</EVENT> for a bigger slice of the profits at any  time.&#13;
However the players have already <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">received</EVENT> just under a million dollars, to  be <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">shared</EVENT> out however Panagoulias sees fit.&#13;
Yet should they <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="should">emerge</EVENT> from their group with Argentina, Nigeria, and  Bulgaria, Greek fans back home, and thousands of Greek-American supporters,  would <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="would">argue</EVENT> they were <EVENT eid="e22" class="STATE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">worth</EVENT> every drachma.&#13;
Greek national television will <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="FUTURE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">show</EVENT> every World Cup match, most live, in  102 hours of coverage.&#13;
Greek enthusiasm for the pioneering footballers will be <EVENT eid="e24" class="STATE" tense="FUTURE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">intense</EVENT>, but the  players must <EVENT eid="e25" class="I_ACTION" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="must">overcome</EVENT> crippling inexperience if they are to <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">emerge</EVENT> from their  group.&#13;
There are no world class players in the squad, and few have been <EVENT eid="e27" class="I_ACTION" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">asked</EVENT> to  <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">play</EVENT> abroad.&#13;
