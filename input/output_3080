Government troops and rebels fought throughout the  night with heavy weapons around a gendarmerie base in Kigali and the camp of  the presidential guard, but the guns fell silent just before 9:00 a.m. (0700  GMT) Monday, UN spokesman Abdul Kabia reported from the Rwandan capital.
That was shortly after a ceasefire had been due to come into effect at  8:00 a.m.
Journalists who visited the site meanwhile said they saw the bodies of 15  soldiers of the mainly Hutu government army and 25 civilians killed during a  four-day battle for Kigali airport and an adjoining government army base which  the mainly Tutsi troops of the Rwandan Patriotic Front overran Sunday.
The warring parties agreed to a two-day ceasefire during the visit of  Iqbal Riza, a special envoy of UN Secretary General Boutros Boutro-Ghali, who  is due to discuss increasing the UN troop strength in the small central  African nation from 400 to 5,500.
He was due to arrive later Monday by road from Uganda.
