Russia has offered to hold its next round of debt  talks with creditor states in the Club of Paris June 2-3, Deputy Prime  Minister Alexander Shokhin said Tuesday.
Shokhin recalled at a press conference that under the draft budget for  1994, Russia had earmarked only 4.1 billion dollars for repayment of the debt.
Creditor countries "will have to be realistic," he said, adding that the  repayment would also depend on the stance taken by Italy which was the only  creditor with which Russia had not signed a draft agreement.
A meeting on the debt owed by Russia and the former Soviet Union had  initially been announced for the end of May. The Club of Paris brings together  19 creditor countries owed money by Russia and the former Soviet Union.
The draft Russian budget, for which the general outline of income and  expenditure was given a first reading on May 11 by members of the Duma  (parliament), allows for a budget deficit equivalent to 9.7 percent of gross  domestic product. This is just short of the maximum limit of 10 percent to  qualify for new finance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Last week Shokhin had said that Russia could meet only 40 percent of the  amounts due on the foreign debt this year. Interest owed by Russia to the  members of the Club of Paris for the first quarter of 1994 alone amounts to  one billion dollars.
The total former Soviet debt, inherited by Russia, is put at 80 billion  dollars of which about 33 billion dollars is public debt owed to the  governments of creditor countries.
In February members of the club extended until the end of April an  agreement reached in April 1993 on the rescheduling of more than 15 billion  dollars of public debt inherited from the former Soviet Union and falling due  in 1992 and 1993.
