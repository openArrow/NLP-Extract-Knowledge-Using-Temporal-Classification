The Cuban government announced sharp increases in  prices of certain goods and services as part of an effort to reign in an  expanding budget deficit.
The executive committee of the Council of Ministers decreed hikes of at  least 50 percent in the price of cigarettes and cigars, alcoholic beverages,  gasoline and gasoil, electric power, postal and telegraphic services and  non-urban transportation.
The new prices and fees will go into effect June 1, according to the  decree which was published Monday in the weekly Trabajadores, the official  publication of the state-run labor union.
Although the increases were steep, prices were still below black market  prices for those goods and services.
Fares for inter-city buses rose 116 percent, domestic air fares were up 80  percent and train fares were raised 60 percent.
Electricity, which is severely rationed, also was targeted for big  increases proportional to the amount consumed.
The price hikes seek to reduce a 4.2 billion peso deficit -- the  equivalent in US dollars at the official exchange rate -- and an estimated 12  billion peso surplus in the money supply.
Under a package of measures authorized by the National Assembly May 2, the  price hikes are to be followed by other steps, including a progressive income  tax and reductions in subsidies to state enterprises.
