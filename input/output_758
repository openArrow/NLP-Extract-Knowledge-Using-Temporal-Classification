Handguns were used in almost one million crimes  in the United States in 1992, a record, although violent crime in general was  on the decrease, according to a Justice Department report released Sunday.
Handguns were used in 917,500 non-fatal crimes in 1992, a 50 percent  increase over the average for the previous five years.
The US government acted to limit handgun use late last year by introducing  legislation imposing a five-day waiting period to buy guns so that police can  check the background of the purchaser.
Legislation that would ban 19 semi-automatic weapons is currently being  worked out in Congress.
The Justice Department figures are based on the results of household  interviews nationwide with the victims.
