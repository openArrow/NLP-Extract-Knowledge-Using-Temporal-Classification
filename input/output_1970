China warned the United States Thursday not to  attach any conditions to renewal of its MFN status, saying such an action  would have an "adverse influence" on bilateral ties.
A foreign ministry spokeswoman said most-favoured-nation (MFN) trade  status was "a reciprocal and a mutually beneficial trade arrangement."
"Any move which runs counter to this will undermine the foundation for the  economic and trade relations between the two countries and will have adverse  influences on Sino-US relations," she said.
The comments followed confirmation by a senior US official Wednesday that  Washington may settle for imposing limited sanctions on Beijing to express  displeasure over its human rights record, rather than carrying out its threat  to withdraw China's MFN status.
China has consistently condemned US President Bill Clinton's 1993 decision  to make "significant overall progress" in human rights a condition for this  year's renewal of MFN. Clinton must make a decision on the issue by June 3.
US businessmen, who have invested some eight billion dollars in China,  have warned the president that even attaching conditions could draw a visceral  response from Beijing.
Foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said China had taken note of support  from US businessmen, congressmen and journalists for the unconditional renewal  of MFN, saying this was a "positive" development.
"We hope the United States government will make a sensible decision," he  told a weekly news briefing.
He said the two sides seek to resolve their differences through dialogue  on a equal footing, indicating that there was in any case only so much Beijing  could do to satisfy Washington.
"The US can only do what is permitted by its laws. The same is true of  China. China can only do what is permitted by China's laws," Wu said.
He said it would be "inappropriate" to give details of any ongoing  diplomacy, but added that "the channels for contact between the two countries  are alway in place.
