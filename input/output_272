Kantor
(RECASTS - details of statement)
WASHINGTON, May 13 (AFP) - US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said he  had agreed Friday with Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa on the need for  preliminary contacts to resume bilateral trade talks.
The so-called framework agreement negotiations collapsed last February  because of a dispute over how to measure progress in opening Japan's market  and reducing its 60-billion-dollar trade surplus with the United States.
In Tokyo, officials said Kakizawa had agreed to resume the stalled  framework talks, but Kantor's statement spoke only of preliminary contacts.
"Ambassador Kantor agreed with the suggestion of Foreign Minister Kakizawa  on the need for preliminary contact between both sides to explore the basis  for resumption of the framework talks," the statement said.
"They both shared the hope that a basis will emerge for the resumption of  the framework talks before the July G7 meeting in Naples," it said.
Kakizawa called Kantor and they discussed the issue for 30 minutes, the  statement said.
