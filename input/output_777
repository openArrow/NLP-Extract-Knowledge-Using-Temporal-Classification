Around 25,000 fans welcomed Manchester  United's history-making heroes during a victory parade here on Sunday.
Alex Ferguson and his stars, winners of the FA Cup and League  championship, were driven through the streets in an open-topped double-decker  bus.
Just 150 supporters were waiting for the team when they arrived home by  train at Manchester's Piccadilly station. But the cup squad met noisy,  cheering crowds when they started their parade later.
Supporters jostled each other on the crowded pavements to get a better  view of their heroes who beat Chelsea 4-0 in Saturday's Cup Final.
The bus was flanked by 20 mounted police, half a dozen motorcyclists, two  police cars, three vans and an ambulance, although there were no problems  during the celebrations.
