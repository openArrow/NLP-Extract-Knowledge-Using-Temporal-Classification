Algerian President Liamine Zeroual has installed a  200-seat interim parliament, grouping politicians, bureaucrats, trade  unionists and businessmen in a forum aimed at steering the country away from  civil war and into democracy.
Zeroual was sworn in as president in January to see the country through  the crisis which erupted in January 1992 when the government cancelled the  second round of a general election the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front  (FIS) was poised to win.
He renewed his pledge Wednesday to "relaunch political dialogue" and said  one of his first priorities was to "reestablish the stability of the country"  and uphold respect for the security of people and property.
Suspected fundamentalists, who have had no legal political voice since the  FIS was banned shortly after the cancellation of the poll, launched a campaign  against foreigners last November.
Explaining his two-pronged approach, Zeroual said: "Those are the  objectives that the state will pursue relentlessly until we have definitively  eradicated the seeds of violence and terrorism from our society."
The 200 seats allocated Wednesday are on the basis of 85 for political  parties, 85 for trade union, business and professional organisations, and 30  for the administration.
The five legal parties with the most support among Algerians are  boycotting the parliament and have refused to take up their allotted 22 seats.
They snubbed the National Conference of Consensus that Zeroual called in  January to lay the groundwork for the interim parliament, or National Council  of Transition (CNT).
Strict security was thrown round the centre of Algiers for the ceremony,  with police out in force.
