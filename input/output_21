A 1947 massacre of native Taiwanese people is to be  mentioned for the first time in history textbooks, officials said Thursday.
A compilation board, made up of scholars and experts, has completed a  draft of the new school textbook including details of the massacre by  Nationalist troops which used to be a taboo subject here, education officials  said.
The massacre, known as the February 28 Incident, which saw thousands of  native Taiwanese people killed, has harmed relations between Taiwan natives  and immigrants from China for many years.
The Nationalist government still ruled mainland China at the time it sent  troops to suppress riots in Taiwan, which had reverted to Chinese rule after  Japan was defeated at the end of World War II in 1945.
The riots were started by native Taiwanese who claimed they were being  ruled high-handedly by the Nationalist-controlled local government in Taiwan.
Now first year junior high school students here will be able to learn of  the massacre in the book, tentatively entitled "Knowing Taiwan," from the  start of the 1995 academic year, the officials said.
The book will also present details of the economic, social and political  conditions during the martial law period from 1949 to 1987.
The Nationalists fled to Taiwan from the mainland after being defeated by  the communists in the 1949 civil war.
