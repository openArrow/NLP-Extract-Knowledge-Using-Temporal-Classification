Kentucky Derby winner Go for Gin goes  for the second leg of US racing's Triple Crown Saturday in the one and  three-16ths mile Preakness Stakes.
The Nick Zito-trained colt was the early 2-1 favorite to become the first  Derby winner since Sunday Silence in 1989 to win the Preakness.
As in the Kentucky Derby, Go for Gin wil be ridden by Chris McCarron. They  will start from the number two post position, and Zito said he would not be  surprised if McCarron took him to the front early.
"If McCarron wanted, I bet he could get to the lead with Go for Gin, if he  wanted," Zito said.
That was the strategy McCarron used in winning the Derby by nearly two  lengths over Strodes Creek. That was on a sloppy track, but Zito said Go for  Gin will be equally at home if the Pimlico track is fast, as predicted.
The Derby was the Go for Gin's third victory in five races on muddy or  sloppy tracks. He finished second in the other two, but he has also won twice  on fast tracks.
Two of his rivals are Maryland-breds Concern and Looming, entered together  and trained by Richard Small.
"They run a great deal alike, but I don't know which is the better right  now," Small said.
The last Maryland-bred to win the Preakness was Deputed Testamony in 1983.
He was also the last horse to win the Preakness after missing the Kentucky  Derby, but this year only four Derby starters are in the Preakness.
Along with Go for Gin they are Blumin Affair, third in the Derby, Tabasco  Cat and Powis Castle.
If all 10 horses entered start, the 119th Preakness will be worth 688,800  dollars, with 447,720 dollars for the winner.
