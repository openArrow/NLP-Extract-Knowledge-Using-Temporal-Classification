The initial public offering for 20 percent of  Petron Corp., the Philippines' largest oil refiner and retailer, has been  scheduled for July 18, the energy department said here Friday.
The listing, which could involve one billion shares, would be the largest  ever in the history of the Philippine stock market.
Newspapers have estimated an offer price of six to 11 pesos (21 to 40  cents), but the department said the price had not yet been set.
Half of the proceeds of the offering will go to Petron's parent firm, the  state-owned Philippine National Oil Co., to fund energy and petrochemical  projects and the rest to the national treasury.
The government sold 40 percent of Petron to the Saudi Arabian Oil Co. for  502 million dollars in December. The public listing would be the second stage  of its privatization, with Manila saying it would retain 40 percent equity.
