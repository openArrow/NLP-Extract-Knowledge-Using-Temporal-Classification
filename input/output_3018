Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic said he  would lead a government delegation to Geneva Monday for talks with the  international contact group on the war in his country.
Speaking Sunday on Bosnian television, he dismissed as blackmail threats  from France and Britain to withdraw their peacekeepers from the former  Yugoslav republic if a settlement to the two-year-old war is not reached soon.
"We are completely in favor of a peaceful solution, but if we are forced  to defend ourselves against aggression, we will defend ourselves," Silajdzic  said.
The contact group comprises representatives of the the European Union,  Russia, the United States and the United Nations.
It has proposed a four-month ceasefire to allow for the resumption of  peace talks.
