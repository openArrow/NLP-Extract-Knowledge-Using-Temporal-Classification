Efforts by FIFA and World Cup organizers to  talk Washington police out of fencing in the pitch at RFK Stadium have failed,  city officials said Thursday.
Washington police plan to erect a six-foot (2m), chain-link fence in a bid  to prevent pitch invasions during the five World Cup matches to be played here.
FIFA, world football's governing body, and World Cup organizers, had tried  to persuade police against the move, but city officials said it would cost  nearly 1 million dollars to pay extra police in the absence of a fence.
"The safety and security of fans, participants and the public has always  been our overriding concern," said a statement issued by Washington mayor  Sharon Pratt Kelly and Police Chief Fred Thomas.
The final agreement was reached Thursday at a meeting attended by World  Cup chairman Alan Rothenberg.
"The configuration of RFK Stadium, the location, height and design of the  fence will do the job in the least obtrusive manner possible," Rothenberg said.
Of the nine World Cup host cities, Dallas and Stanford also plan to use  fences, despite the objections of football officials.
Dallas police have already put up a fence around the field at the Cotton  Bowl, and Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto, California, has a permanent fence  around the field.
