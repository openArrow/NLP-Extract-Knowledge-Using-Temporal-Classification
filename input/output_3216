North Korea Monday criticized the RIMPAC military  drills planned by Japan and other western countries in the Pacific this year.
"The naval forces of the United States, Japan and the South Korean puppets  plan to form the first unified fleet ever in history and stage a joint  operation against fleets of other countries," a North Korean foreign ministry  spokesman said.
"The Korean people are not afraid of anyone's military action, but are  prepared to counter even the US-orchestrated multi-national military action,"  the spokesman was quoted as saying by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).
KCNA quoted the official as saying in a statement that "the joint  operation is going to be staged by a unified fleet this time while the  military bosses of the United States, Japan and South Korea are holding  aggressive confabs repeatedly against the DPRK (North Korea)."
"We cannot but be alerted against the United States bringing into the open  through such joint operation its intention to force the military action  against the DPRK," the North Korean spokesman said.
Details of the planned RIMPAC exercises were not immediately available.
