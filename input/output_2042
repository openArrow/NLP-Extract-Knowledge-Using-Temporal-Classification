Israel's internal security agency, the Shin  Beth, has asked Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to conceal the identities of  people whose telephones are being tapped, the daily Haaretz said Thursday.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and his government have pledged only to  publicize names by court order.
Shin Beth's request came after the local press reported that two private  detectives had tapped portable telephones belonging to about 400 people,  including President Ezer Weizman and State Comptroller Myriam Ben Porat.
"The list of other people under surveillance must in no case be publicized   for reasons of state security," Shin Beth officials were quoted as saying  late Wednesday during a meeting with Rabin, Justice Minister David Libai and  Police Minister Moshe Shahal.
Under a proposed law, the prime minister, who heads Shin Beth, will only  be able to order the monitoring of portable phones in specific cases and for a  limited time.
The bill is to be presented next week to the cabinet legislative  committtee, and then the Knesset, or parliament.
Court orders for surveillance will only be given to prevent crimes, fraud,  and drug trafficking, according to the bill.
The two private detectives who allegedly tapped the telephones were   arrested five weeks ago on suspicion of listening into the conversations of  press chiefs, two Likud party members and bankers.
Their lawyers said there was no law in Israel forbidding the surveillance  of portable telephones.
The detectives are also under investigation for allegedly tapping the  conversations of the head of the Radio and Television Office, and former  police officers. Who employed them and why has not been revealed.
