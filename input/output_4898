A Lebanese drug-trafficker was executed by a firing  squad at dawn Saturday after being sentenced to death for the murder of three  policemen, state-run television reported.
Shaker Amran al-Bridi was executed in Syrian-controlled eastern Lebanon  where on March 20 he killed three members of a anti-drug squad trying to  control drugs in the eastern Bekaa valley.
It was the fourth time the death penalty has been carried out in just over  a month after being reactivated following a wave of violence in the country.  The three others were hanged.
