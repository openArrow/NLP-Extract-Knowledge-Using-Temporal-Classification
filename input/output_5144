Gulf Air made high profits in the first quarter  of 1994 and expects a record performance this year as it presses ahead with  multi-billion-dollar expansion projects, its chief said on Sunday.
Salim ibn Naser al-Siyyabi said nine new aircraft would join the company's  fleet this year, for which a budget of 1.2 billion dollars has been approved,  while flights would be operated to new destinations, notably Asia.
Another four Airbuses will be delivered next year, he said, adding the  deals would be financed through loans and the company's own resources.
"Gulf Air made net profits of around 18 million dollars in the first  quarter of this year. This is far higher than the earnings made in the same  period of last year," he told reporters in Abu Dhabi.
"We are optimistic that this year will be the best for Gulf Air in terms  of operations and air traffic."
Siyyabi said that Gulf Air would increase operations to Asia, as well as  launch its first non-stop flight to New York by its new Airbus A-340 on June  30.
"Gulf Air's operational plan for this year concentrates on China and  Vietnam and the Far East in general. We will also increase our flights to  Japan and India to face growing demand," he said.
The airline, owned by Abu Dhabi, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman, has chalked out  plans to expand its fleet and destinations and upgrade its services and staff  to face growing business and competition in the region.
It made net profits of between 40 and 50 million dollars annually over the  past three years and its operations grew by as fast as 15 percent. But it has  projected a six percent growth annually over the next five years.
