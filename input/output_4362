Welsh international striker Dean Saunders denied on  Thursday he deliberately "went over the top" with the tackle that ended former  Chelsea captain Paul Elliott's career.
Asked by his own counsel in the High Court, Antony Berrisford, whether he  could have "realistically" done anything else in the situation, Saunders  replied: "No, it was just fate."
Elliott, 30, is suing Saunders, 29, and his then-club Liverpool over the  September 1992 incident at Anfield, which left him with ruptured knee  ligaments.
Saunders, who joined Aston Villa for 2.3 million pounds five days after  the incident, and Liverpool deny liability, the sole issue to be decided at  this stage.
Saunders said of the incident, 10 minutes into the match: "I went for the  ball. The only thing in my mind was the ball."
"Instinct told me to get my feet off the floor. That was the only way I  would get the ball without getting seriously hurt."
"I didn't think there was any need for Elliott to lunge. I thought I was  in danger because of it."
