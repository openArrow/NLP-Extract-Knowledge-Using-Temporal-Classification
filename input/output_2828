President Bill Clinton signed an  executive order Saturday to implement the tougher UN trade embargo due to be  slapped on Haiti within hours.
The embargo was to take effect after midnight Saturday (0400 GMT Sunday)  unless Haiti's military rulers resign to allow the reinstatement of  democratically elected president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. He was ousted by  Haiti's military rulers in September 1991 and lives in exile in Washington.
The order, signed by Clinton as he wound up a two-day visit to California,  would freeze US trade with Haiti, except some foods and medical supplies.
The order exempts rice, beans, sugar, oil, corn, milk, wheat flour or  cornmeal, "provided that neither the 'de facto' regime in Haiti nor any person  designated by the Secretary of the Treasury ... is a direct or indirect party  to the transaction."
Additional measures in UN Security Council resolution 917 took effect when  the resolution was approved on May 6, including a ban on non-commercial  flights and a freeze on new US visas for and financial assets held by some 600  people, including Haiti's military leaders and their families.
The resolution set a 15-day deadline aimed at pressing Haiti's army rulers  to step down and allow for Aristide's return.
But UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali told the Security Council  Friday there was no sign the military would comply with UN demands.
"I regret to inform the Council that there has been no change in the  attitude of the Haitian military," Boutros-Ghali said in a statement.
