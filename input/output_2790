Chile is seeking associate status with the South  American trade bloc Mercosur, President Eduardo Frei said Saturday.
Mercosur groups Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay in a mega-market  of more than 190 million consumers. Its members are aiming to remove all trade  barriers among them by 1995.
"Chile has a great historic opportunity," Frei said. "Our relationship  with Mercosur is of special interest to us as it includes Chile's top two  trading partners in Latin America," Argentina and Brazil.
Frei said Chile in the next few months would formally propose an  association plan that, without involving joining the common market, would lead  eventually to a free-trade zone "in (Mercosur's) neighboring area."
Chile's government also is negotiating with the United States, seeking  either a bilateral free trade agreement, or some form of membership in the  North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which groups Canada, Mexico and  the United States.
While Chile has experienced booming economic growth of an average six  percent over the past 10 years, Frei said his government would work hard to  eliminate the poverty in which one third of the country's 13.5 million people  still live.
"We can give a human face to politics," the Christian Democratic leader  said.
