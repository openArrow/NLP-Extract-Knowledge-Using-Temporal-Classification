Unconfirmed reports indicate that Rwandan rebels  have captured Kigali airport, the UN Assistance Mission for the tiny central  African state reported Sunday.
A fierce battle between Rwanda's mainly Hutu army and the Tutsi-dominated  Rwandan Patriotic Front at the airport continued Sunday, preventing relief  planes from landing for the fourth day in a row and halting UN efforts to pave  the way for a new peacekeeping mission, the UN mission's Nairobi office  reported.
It said the mission in Kigali could not be contacted because its satellite  dish had been damaged.
The United Nations has been trying to secure neutral status for the  airport to allow it to fly in humanitarian aid and reinforcements for the UN  peacekeeping troops.
The rebels replied that they considered the airport a military target  because the government army had a major base just beside it.
At least two million of Rwanda's seven million people have been made  homeless by the fighting which erupted in early April, and hundreds of  thousands have fled the country.
Estimates of those butchered range up to around 500,000.
