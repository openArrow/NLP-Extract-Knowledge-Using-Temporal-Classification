Iranian pilgrims in Mecca will stage a political  rally in Mecca on Tuesday despite a Saudi ban, the head of the Iranian  pilgrimage delegation Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri said Sunday.
Reyshahri, quoted by the official Iranian news agency IRNA, told a group  of pilgrims that holding the "deliverance from the infidels" rally was a  "religious must" and urged everyone to participate.
The anti-US and anti-Israel demonstrations are "aimed at fostering Islamic  unity and enlightening the ummah (Moslems) about the dangers from  disbelievers," he said.
Reyshahri however urged pilgrims to be "disciplined and peaceful" to avoid  any "unseemly incidents."
Saudi authorities warned last week that it would not allow Iranian  pilgrims to carry out their demonstrations.
IRNA said Saturday that the Saudi riot police had taken up positions  around the Iranian pilgrims camps in Mecca to prevent the rallies from being  held.
Police were deployed on both sides of the entrance to the camp, while  about 10 police cars and armoured vehicles were stationed in the streets  opposite, the agency said.
It also charged that two cameras, placed on the roofs of two tall  buildings across the street, were filming all movements to and from the camp  around the clock.
Similar demonstrations have triggered clashes with Saudi police in  previous years, the most violent being in 1987, when 400 pilgrims, including  275 Iranians, were killed. Diplomatic ties between the two countries were  broken off for three years afterwards.
Tehran and Riyadh are also in dispute over the the numbers of Iranian  pilgrims to be allowed in Mecca. Iran says the Saudis have halved its quota of  pilgrims to 60,000.
But Riyadh countered that it was applying a quota system agreed with other  Islamic countries allowing one pilgrim for every thousand people.
The annual Moslem pilgrimage this year is to start on May 19 in Mecca, the  birth place of the prophet Mohammad and Islam's holiest shrine.
