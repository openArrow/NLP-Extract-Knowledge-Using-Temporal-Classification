A stampede at the pilgrimage in Mecca killed 700  people on Monday, the daily Kayhan reported on Tuesday quoting its  correspondent in the Saudi city.
Quoting "unofficial sources" in Saudi Arabia, it said six of the dead were  Iranians.
A Turkish official has spoken of 182 dead while other eye witnesses put  the total at more than 200.
The paper said that 130 other pilgrims had died for various other reasons  during the pilgrimage.
That would give a total virtually identical to the 829 issued by the Saudi  authorities as the overall number of deaths for the whole pilgrimage.
