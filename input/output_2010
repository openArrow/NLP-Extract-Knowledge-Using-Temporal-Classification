A medical study of rugby players  shows those who engage in endurance training reduce their risk of injury 25  percent.
But those in interval training are twice as likely to be injured as those  who do not train at all, a conference here was told Thursday.
A study by Otago University found 90 percent of the 356 players involved  in club rugby here last winter season were injured at some point during the  season.
Yvonne Bird told the Physical Education New Zealand conference that men  players who undertook endurance training like running, swimming and aerobics  to improve their fitness decreased their risk of injury by 25 percent.
But men who undertook interval training, like circuit training and  sprints, and possibly over-trained, were twice as likely to be injured than  those who did not train.
There was no significant difference between women who did train and those  who did not.
The study showed most injuries (35.9 percent) occurred in tackles. Just  over 15 percent of injuries occurred during rucks and 11.3 percent in mauls.
Most of the injuries (74 percent) were soft tissue injuries: sprains,  strains and lacerations.
Ankle injuries (14 percent) were the most common while shoulder and  collarbone (12 percent) and face, outer ear and eye injuries (11 percent) were  next.
The higher the level the game was played at, the greater the rate of  injuries.
The study also showed that, for every 100 games of rugby among men, there  were 11.5 injuries, while the number reduced to 6.4 injuries for every 100  games among women.
