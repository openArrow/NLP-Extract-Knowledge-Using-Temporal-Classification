Japan's Sumitomo Chemical Co. Ltd. slashed its group  pre-tax earnings forecast for the year to December to 14 billion yen (135  million dollars) on Monday, down sharply from its earlier estimate of 27  billion yen.
The company, one of Japan's leading chemical concerns, blamed lower  earnings at its pharmaceutical subsidiary and other units for the downward  revision.
Sumitomo Chemical also slashed its consolidated sales forecast from 960  billion yen to 930 billion yen. The company posted a pre-tax profit of 35.7  billion yen last year on sales of 937 billion yen.
