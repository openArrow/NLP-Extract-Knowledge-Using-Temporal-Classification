SANAA, May 31 (AFP) - The UN Security Council must recognize the unity of  Yemen or the government will reject its peace efforts, a senior northern  official warned Tuesday as the Council met on the civil war.
Deputy Prime Minister Abdelwahab al-Anisi said the Security Council  "cannot stop the legitimate forces" from fighting for unity.
"Anything which does not recognise unity and the election results, or  which does not halt interference from neighbouring countries, will be  rejected," he told AFP, referring to last year's parliamentary elections.
Northern troops loyal to President Ali Abdallah Saleh and southern forces  have been at war since May 5, four years after the former conservative North  and Marxist South merged to form a united Yemen.
In New York, the Security Council began debate Tuesday on efforts to bring  about a ceasefire and resumption of negotiations.
