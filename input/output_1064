Gianfranco Fini, leader of the neo-fascist National  Alliance, is to withdraw a parliamentary bill seeking to rescind a  constitutional ban on reforming Italy's Fascist party, news reports said.
According to a report Monday afternoon from the Italian agency AGI, Fini  signed an Alliance motion calling for the repeal of an article in Italy's  constitution outlawing the party led by Mussolini.
The motion, placed before parliament's lower house on April 27, was also  signed by the Alliance's Vincenzo Trantino, was has been named under secretary  of state for foreign affairs in Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's new  cabinet, the agency added.
The Alliance, part of the right-wing coalition headed by Berlusconi's  Forza Italia that won March elections, has five representatives in the new  government.
Fini told journalists Monday he had no recollection of signing the motion,  but added that, had he done so, he would have "no problem" in withdrawing it.
By way of explanation he added: "Several motions are sometimes signed en  bloc at the beginning of a parliamentary term."
Monday afternoon Maurizio Gasparri, incoming under secretary of state for  the interior and a member of neo-fascist Italian Social Movement which Fini  also heads, announced that Fini would withdraw the bill, thereby confirming  its existence.
Gasparri added that the motion was part of a "package" automatically put  before each incoming parliament.
Earlier Monday Berlusconi, presenting his government programme in a speech  to the Senate, acknowledged what he called "legitimate concerns," notably  voiced abroad, over having five members of the Alliance in his government.
But he pledged his administration would adhere to Italy's democratic  structures.
