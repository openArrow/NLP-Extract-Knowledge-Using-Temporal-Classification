Budapest Municipal Court on Monday ordered the  dissolution of the neo-Nazi World National Party for the People's Rule, the  MTI news agency reported.
The court ruled that the organisation violated legislation on human  dignity, personal rights and the right to association. The party is to appeal.
The neo-Nazi organisation slipped through normal court registration  procedures last year, as the court is not legally obliged to examine a party's  goals or conduct when approving registration.
However, police later discovered that organisation -- mainly supported by  neo-Nazi skinheads -- openly denied the Holocaust, made anti-semitic remarks  and hailed the memory of Hungarian Nazi leader Ferenc Szalasi during meetings.
Szalasi was executed here in 1946 for his role in the deportation of  600,000 Hungarian Jews to gas chambers in Nazi Germany during World War II.
Party leader Albert Szabo, a Hungarian-born Australian citizen known for  his ties with western European and US neo-Nazi leaders, is currently in police  custody for anti-semitic incitement.
