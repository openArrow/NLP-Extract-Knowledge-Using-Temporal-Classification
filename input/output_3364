Mustapha Hadji, the man who chose to play for  Morocco rather than France, believes the Lions of the Atlas can scale the  World Cup heights.
"Anyone who writes us off is set for a surprise," said the 22-year-old who  made his international debut in the decisive World Cup qualifier against  Zambia.
Hadji, already picked to play for Fance's Under 21 side, astounded the  French when he said yes to Abdellah Blinda.
"I'd seen he was scoring a lot of goals in the French second division so I  rang him up," the national team coach said.
Blinda, a former handball international, was appointed manager a month  before that match against Zambia. He had a phone call from King Hassan at  half-time when the score was still 0-0 which meant Zambia qualified.
But Hadji played a blinder and Abdelsalam Laghrissi's 50th minute header  soothed the monarch's nerves although Morocco were unpopular winners.
The rest of the footballing world wanted to see Zambia, who had lost 18  players in an air crash off Gabon last year, go to the United States.
Hadji says the reaction of his club, Nancy, was disappointing. "They  called me a traitor for turning my back on France after I'd lived here for so  long. But even some Moroccans couldn't understand why I didn't pick France."
Krimau, who played in the 1986 side which was stopped by a Lothar Matthaus  free kick for Germany in the second round in Mexico, believes Morocco have  unearthed a gem.
"He's going to be a star in the United States. He's got everything," said  the former striker who also played most of his career in France.
Morocco face Belgium, Holland and Saudi Arabia in their first round group.  They believe they can beat the Saudis and take at least one point off Belgium  or Holland to qualify for the second round.
