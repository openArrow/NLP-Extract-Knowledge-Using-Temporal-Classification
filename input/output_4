This time, Nigel Mansell will not be  left behind on a restart.
The English racer's bid for victory here last year in his first  Indianapolis 500 was foiled when eventual winner Emerson Fittpaldi and  runner-up Arie Luyendyk passed him when a mid-race caution period ended.
That was how Mansell learned passing was allowed on the 2.5-mile (4k) oval  here as soon as the green flag waves, not at the start-finish line.
"The restart was a painful lesson regarding the rules of the race track,"  Mansell said. "There are some different rules here. Now I know about them. I  wasn't as prepared as I will be this year."
The reigning Indy-car series champion will be among top contenders in  Saturday's battle for pole position in the 78th Indy 500. Time trials for the  May 29 race continue the next two weekends.
"I'm optimistic, yes, but confident, no," Mansell said. "It's going to be  a tough weekend. This track stands alone as king of the circuits. It carries a  lot more excitement for the driver. It's incredibly demanding here."
Mansell's Cosworth-powered Lola has a top speed of 227.969 mph (364.750  k/hr) during this week's practice sessions. That ranks fifth for the week  behind Brazilian's Fittipaldi and Raul Boesel, Canada's Paul Tracy and  Mansell's teammate, Mario Andretti.
"I'm pleased with my speeds," Mansell said. "We will work on the car and  try to go a little quicker yet. When I came back here the first day I was  probably a one. Now I'm maybe a six on a learning scale. I'll be up to nine or  10 by Saturday. But it takes time."
