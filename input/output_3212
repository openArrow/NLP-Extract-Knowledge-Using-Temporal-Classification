Sudanese rebels said Monday the government refused  to discuss a ceasefire during last week's peace talks in Kenya because  Khartoum had the "illusion" that it can achieve military victory over rebel  fighters.
"A ceasefire was raised by the mediators but the government delegation  rejected it because they have the illusion that they will defeat the SPLA  (Sudan People's Liberation Army) militarily," said Pagan Amum, spokesman for  the mainstream SPLA delegation in the latest round of Sudan peace talks held  in Nairobi last week.
The negotiations between Sudan's Islamic fundmentalist military government  and the mainly Christian SPLA were adjourned here Saturday after both sides  agreed on an agenda for another round in July.
A major government offensive launched at the end of last year had been  fought off by the rebels on three fronts and the only two active fronts in the  Eastern Nile region were now bogged down after heavy rains in the vast  swampland, said Amum at a news conference.
He accused the government of wasting Sudan's resources and human lives in  a bloody war.
Last week's round of peace talks was the latest in a series of so far  fruitless efforts to broker a peaceceful settlement to the 11-year conflict by  the Inter-governmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD), grouping  Kenya, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sudan and Uganda.
