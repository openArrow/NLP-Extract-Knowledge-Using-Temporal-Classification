The White House hosted 200 veterans, including  73 who fought in World War II, for a breakfast Monday with President Bill  Clinton as part of Memorial Day ceremonies.
In brief remarks, Clinton, who leaves for Europe Wednesday for ceremonies  to mark the 50th anniversary of the Allied invasion of France, praised the  contributions of those who had fought on the beaches of Normandy.
"I hope that when you go back (to Normandy), you will feel the immense  pride and gratitude that all Americans feel for the sacrifice you made, the  commitment you made and for all the days you made possible in the 50 years  since," the president told the World War II veterans.
"We sometimes forget that no democracy in human history has ever lasted as  long as the United States of America," he said, as First Lady Hillary Clinton  looked on.
The president also introduced 10 stamps representing key battles in World  War II, including one commemorating the landings at Normandy on June 6, 1944.  Others mark the liberations of Rome on June 4, 1944 and Paris on August 25,  1944.
The president's next stop will be Arlington National Cemetery within sight  of the US Capitol where he will speak and place a wreath at the tomb of the  Unknown Soldier.
