Last month's four million dollar holdup at  UN headquarters in Somalia was made possible by "gross negligence" by UN  employees, some of whom are being disciplined, officials said Wednesday.
After an internal investigation, one person has resigned and several were  suspended, officials said. The names and nationalities of the employees were  not disclosed.
The UN inquiry was headed by Mohamed Niazi, who heads internal  investigations at the international organization. Scotland Yard was heading a  separate probe in an effort to find the thieves, UN officials said.
