Pope John Paul II is now walking on crutches and  should be able to leave hospital at the end of next week after breaking his  right thigh on May 5, a Vatican spokesman said Saturday.
"At that time, he should be down to one crutch," the spokesman said.
No decision has yet been made on whether the pope will recuperate at the  Vatican or his nearby summer residence, Castel Gandolfo. The Castel Gondolfo  has a swimming pool, which could be useful for hydrotherapy, but has many  steps.
