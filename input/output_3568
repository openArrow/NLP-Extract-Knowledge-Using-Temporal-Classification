A stampede Monday at the pilgrimage in Mecca  killed 252 people, Indonesian officials said Tuesday, giving a provisional  toll, while an Iranian daily said nearly three times as many had perished.
"None of the pilgrims killed in the stampede is from Indonesia,"  Indonesian religious affairs ministry spokesman Toto Sugiarto said, quoting  the head of the office for Haj (pilgrimage) affairs, Amidhan, in Mecca.
Sugiarto said the casualties were mostly from Bangladesh, Egypt, India,  Pakistan, Turkey and several African countries.
However, Indonesian television, in a live report from Saudi Arabia, cited  another official from the Haj office, Ali Yasmin, as saying 99 percent of the  casualties were from African countries.
Sugiarto added that as of Monday up to 224 Indonesian Haj pilgrims had  died because of health problems.
Indonesia is the world's most populous Moslem nation, with more than 88  percent of its 186 million population following Islam.
More than 150,000 of its citizens went to Mecca for the pilgrimage this  year.
Earlier Tuesday, the Iranian daily Kayhan, quoting what it termed  "unofficial sources" in Saudi Arabia, said 700 had died in Monday's stampede.
It said six of the dead were Iranians.
A Turkish official has spoken of 182 dead while other witnesses put the  total at more than 200.
