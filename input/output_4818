The Russian minister for privatization on Friday  accused the mayor of Moscow of waging a "campaign" against privatization laws,  warning of an imminent social "explosion" unless reform is allowed to go ahead.
Vice-premier Anatoly Chubais said he had called on the capital's city  authorities to overturn decisions made by mayor Yuri Lujkov, which he said are  preventing ownership reform going ahead, according to news agencies.
In particular Chubais said Moscow's comittee dealing with privatizations  of state companies had steadily decreased the number of such transfers, as  well as the number of companies being offered for sale at auction.
He warned of "a large-scale social explosion" at the end of next month --  the date fixed for the end of a part of Russia's privatization programme which  aims to give citizens a share in the benefits of privatization.
"Two million Muscovites will find themselves with privatization coupons  which they will not have been able to use," he said, adding: "The  responsibility will rest entirely with the mayor of Moscow."
He said Lujkov's policies had led to "the complete abolition of transfer  of public assets into private ownership."
He cited official figures showing that Moscow is lagging behind most of  the rest of Russia when it comes to privatising its assets and businesses.
On Wednesday, Moscow City Council gave the first stage of approval to a  resolution banning the privatization of land in the capital pending the  introduction of full-scale city laws on property ownership.
