Under pressure from critics, the Japanese government  has dropped plans for Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko to visit the USS  Arizona National Memorial at Pearl Harbor during their planned US visit next  month, the Yomiuri Shimbun reported Thursday.
Pearl Harbor on Oahu, Hawaii was the target of Japan's surprise attack on  US forces on December 7, 1941.
Japan's largest national daily said the imperial couple may instead visit  in Hawaii the Punch Bowl national cemetery for the war dead, during their  planned trip to the United States beginning June 10.
"The last-minute change of schedule could draw reaction in the United  States," the daily said.
The Imperial Household Agency official declined to confirm the report.
Although the emperor's US visit was formally decided on March 18, "no  detailed itinerary has been decided yet," an agency official said.
The imperial couple's initial plan to visit the Arizona Memorial on June  24 came under fire from some Japanese scholars and other critics who argued  that no US president has ever visited Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the targets of  atomic bombs dropped by US forces during World War II, it said.
Japan's air attack on Pearl Harbor catapulted the United States into the  war. The attack, which came before Tokyo's official declaration of war against  the United States, left 2,403 Americans dead.
Emperor Akihito's father, the late emperor Hirohito, travelled to the  island of Hawaii in 1975 as part of his US visit, but did not go to Pearl  Harbor.
