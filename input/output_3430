Japan's Suzuki Motor Co. Ltd. said Tuesday its  pre-tax earnings fell 10.2 percent from a year earlier to 18.4 billion yen  (179 million dollars) in the year to March and forecast a further decline this  year.
The country's leading minicar maker and the world's third-largest  manufacturer of motorcycles, said sales declined 4.2 percent to 1,009 billion  yen, hit by lower exports of cars and reduced sales of motorycles in Japan.  Domestic sales alone plunged 8.6 percent to 483 billion yen.
Suzuki forecast even lower earnings of 18 billion yen for the current year  with sales falling to 1,000 billion yen.
In the latest year, revenue from car sales dropped 3.9 percent to 711  billion yen and motorcycle revenues dived 7.3 percent to 168 billion yen.  Revenue from marine and power products fell 1.2 percent to 42 billion yen and  revenue from car parts was down 1.8 percent at 88 billion yen.
In terms of volume, car sales were mainly depressed by a slump in exports.  Domestic sales were stagnant with a modest increase in minicar sales  offsetting lower sales of small cars. Motorcycle sales were depressed by a  sharp decline in domestic sales which outweighed increases in exports.
Suzuki said its total car sales dropped 7.4 percent to 750,468 units with  exports plunging 22.3 percent to 221,230 units. Domestic sales edged up 0.7  percent to 529,238 units with minicar sales rising 0.8 percent to 472,337  units and sales of small cars dropping 0.2 percent to 56,901 units.
Motorcycles sales dropped 3.4 percent to 603,562 units. Exports leapt six  percent to 444,682 units but domestic sales were down 23.2 percent at 158,880  units, the company said.
