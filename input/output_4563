Western Union Financial Services, the US money  transfer firm, has opened an office in Vietnam to tap the estimated one  billion dollars in remittances sent here by overseas Vietnamese, a report said  Friday.
The company is to launch campaigns in the United States, France, Australia  and Canada -- home to about two million Vietnamese -- to encourage them to use  its money transfer services.
Remittances from overseas Vietnamese are expected to grow considerably as  those who fled after the defeat of the Saigon government in 1975 send back  money for family members to invest in the country's growing economy.
The company is to set up operations with two local firms -- Eden Trading  Centre and the Asia Commercial Bank -- to link Vietnam to its offices in 70  countries.
US firms, many of which operated in Saigon before 1975, are rushing back  to Vietnam following the lifting of the US trade embargo in February. Some 60  companies have already opened offices, investing 20 million dollars so far.
