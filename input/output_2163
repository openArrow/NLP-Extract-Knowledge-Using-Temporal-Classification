India has reduced import tariffs on almonds in  their shells, US trade Representative Mickey Kantor said Thursday, a move that  will help make California almond exporters more competitive.
The announcement of a cut in tariffs from 55 rupees per kilogram (2.2  pounds) to 44 rupees per kilogram came during a visit to Washington by Indian  Prime Minister R.V. Narasimha Rao.
"This action demonstrates that we are committed to opening up our markets  further to one another," Kantor said.
Almonds account for six percent of US agricultural exports to India, and  are California's largest food export. US almonds exports are expected to total  48 million dollars this year.
