With 750 million dollars in revenue guaranteed,  sponsorship deals have met half of the 1994 World Cup budget of 1.5 billion  dollars.
"We have already met our objectives," World Cup spokesman John Griffin  said less than a month before the start of the tournament.
He estimated the Cup, which starts on June 17 in nine cities across  America, would realize a surplus of 25 million dollars.
To make the most of its sources of revenue, the organizing committee  instituted several levels of sponsorship.
Eleven multinational corporations paid between 10 and 20 million dollars  to join the elite group of official sponsors. FIFA, football's governing body,  will pocket ALL the revenues from this category.
Sponsors are counting on a cumulative audience of 32 billion for the 52  matches although their main target is the non-US market.
"Soccer is the universal language. If you set out to match a global brand  with a global sport, there is no better choice," said a spokesman for  Gillette, which has the longest history of World Cup sponsorship among US  companies.
Coca-Cola, a World Cup sponsor since 1978, is also focusing its  Cup-related promotions on the non-American market.
Gary Hart, Coke's vice president in charge of international sports  marketing, admitted they were not primarily attracted because the competition  was taking place in the United States.
"We bought into it because it is such a magnificent global event," he said.
The credit card company Mastercard will spend about 75 million dollars on  sponsorship and advertising during the Cup.
"We have targeted the World Cup as a platform to help us build brand  awareness internationally," said Mava Heffler, vice president of advertising  operations.
Both MasterCard and McDonald's will broadcast global television  commercials -- using the same ads on every continent.
