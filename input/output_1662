Recovery of the British economy is continuing  steadily, official figures indicated on Wednesday and dealers said that they  quashed any remaining expectations that interest rates might be cut.
Unemployment and public sector borrowing fell, retail sales rose, and   although headline inflation was higher, underlying inflation, said to be the  more reliable figure, slipped to the lowest annual rate ever.
But economists expressed mild concern about average personal earnings  figures, which rose by a higher-than-expected four percent in the year to  March, compared with revised rises of 3.75 to January and February.
The figures, forecast at around 3.75 percent, "confirm our view that  British interest rates will go up sooner rather than later," Nomura economist  Alison Southey said.
But David McBaine, an economist at NatWest Markets, said that markets were  focusing on average earnings rather than retail prices or unemployment figures  because they were the furthest out of line with expectations.
He said the figures should be treated with caution as March was a  traditional month for the payment of bonuses.
Seasonally-adjusted unemployment fell a larger-than-expected 36,800 in  April to a total of 2,682,500, taking the unemployment rate to 9.5 percent of  the working population from 9.7 percent in March. Forecasts were for a fall of   20,000.
Employment Secretary David Hunt told the BBC: "We are the only European  country where unemployment is below 10 percent and falling."
Inflation rose to 2.6 percent in April from 2.3 percent the previous  month. Underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments, showed  prices had risen by an annual 2.3 percent in April from 2.4 percent in March.
Analysts had predicted headline inflation at 2.7 percent and underlying  inflation at 2.5 percent.
