Ten men were executed Friday for crimes ranging from  murder to motorcycle theft in nearby Zhuhai city, only hours after the United  States renewed China's trading privileges.
Fourteen cities and counties staged executions around the southernmost  province, but while the total number of executed convicts was not immediately  known, 10 were put to death by a firing squad in the nearby city of Zhuhai.
Aged 20 to 30, the convicts were first tried in front of an audience of  workers by the Zhuhai Intermediate People's Court, then put into a truck and  driven to a remote mountain area for immediate execution.
Portugal's Lusa News Agency, quoting court officials, said the men's  appeals for lesser sentences had all been "rejected outright."
Two of the convicts were charged with murder and the others accused of  lesser crimes such as kidnapping, blackmail, and the theft of cars and  motorcycles, Lusa reported.
US President Bill Clinton had announced overnight that he was renewing  China's most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status, as well as delinking human  rights from trade.
Guangdong emerged as China's most prosperous province largely because of  its substantial exports to the United States, particularly garments and toys,  which enjoy lower tariffs under MFN.
