Russia will become an observer member of the  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the Japanese  economic newspaper Nihon Keizai reported Sunday.
A declaration on Russia's membership will be adopted at a ministerial  council meeting of the 25-nation OECD to be held in Paris June 7-8, the  newspaper said in an unattributed story.
The OECD, founded in 1961 as a grouping of non-communist industrialised  nations, is expected to formally admit Russia as an observer member at a full  council meeting later this year, the newspaper said.
It added that Russia was likely to join such OECD committees as industry,  science and technology, and the environment.
