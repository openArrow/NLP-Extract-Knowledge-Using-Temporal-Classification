Pakistan has turned over to Egypt an "Afghan war  veteran" suspected of belonging to the extremist Jihad group and of planning  anti-government operations, a security official said Tuesday.
Ali Eid, 26,is suspected of being a member of the armed wing of Jihad, the  Tala'e el Fath or Vanguard of Conquest  which was behind the attempt to  assassinate Interior Minister Hassan el-Alfi last August.
He was handed over to Egyptian authorities Monday night after his capture  Saturday by Pakistani security forces in an operation to expel "Afghan Arabs",  fundamentalist militants left over from the war against the Soviet occupation  of Afghanistan, the official said.
Eid had been living in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar since  1990.
Egypt and Pakistan signed an extradition agreement in March aimed at  "fighting terrorism in all its forms." The agreement also covers drug dealers.
During the Afghan war, thousands of Islamic fundamentalists from all over  the Arab world used Peshawar as a launching base against the Soviet forces  because of its proximity to Afghanistan.
Egypt accuses militants based in Pakistan of directing extremist groups at  home over the last two years. More than 400 people have been killed since  early 1992 in attacks by Moslem militants and related clashes with security  forces.
