The Montenegrin waltzed past Nadal once more and flicked the ball across  goal to give Massaro an easy tap-in at the far post.
Massaro, who missed a hatful of chances in last year's final, struck his  second in first half injury time -- this time with a left foot drive from just  behind the penalty spot at the end of a sweeping move out of defence.
Zvonomir Boban swept the ball wide to Roberto Donadoni on the left flank.  His busy run took him round the back of the defence and with the Barcelona  defenders looking for Savicevic, his pass with the outside of the foot  perfectly picked out Massaro.
Barcelona looked willing for a second-half battle but Guardiola's blunder  and Savicevic's brilliant strike proved a knock-out punch.
From then on they were a feeble shadow of their normal selves and they  could easily have become the first side to lose a European Cup final by five  goals.
Just seconds before Desailly's goal, Savicevic's stabbed shot came back  off the inside of the post and the Barcelona defence was still trying to  regain its composure when the Frenchman burst through to score.
Milan's fifth European Cup triumph followed previous victories in Europe's  premier competition in 1963, 1969, 1989 and 1990.
It was only the third time any team had won the final by four goals. The  last time it happened was in 1989 when Milan beat Steau Bucharest 4-0.
