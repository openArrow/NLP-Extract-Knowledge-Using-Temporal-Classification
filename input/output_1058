President Nelson Mandela has promised  to donate part of his salary to charity organisations for neglected and  orphaned children, the domestic news agency SAPA reported Monday.
Mandela, inaugurated last Tuesday as South Africa's first  democratically-elected president, made the promise Saturday when he attended  the funeral of Zwelinbanzi Hani, the father of assassinated South African  Communist Party chief Chris Hani who was slain in April last year.
"The problem of neglected children makes my heart bleed because if these  children could be looked after we would not have so many people in jail,"  Mandela said at the funeral in Eastern Cape province.
"These children are driven to steal because of hunger. The money which  will be donated to these charity organisations wil be used for this purpose."
He did not say how much of his 734,350 rands (203,298 dollar) a year  salary he would give to charity.
Dismissing criticism of the size of his pay, Mandela said he was entitled  to the money, but added he would appoint trustees to oversee the use of it.
The president spent the weekend at his home village of Qunu in Eastern  Cape province.
Mandela's African National Congress swept to power in the April 26-29  election, ending more than 300 years of white-minority rule.
