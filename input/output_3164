Bosnian Serb commanders failed to pull 150 armed  policemen out of the eastern town of Gorazde this weekend, as agreed, The UN  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) reported Monday.
The Serbs' failure to abide by the Gorazde accord could torpedo the  resumption of peace talks on Bosnia-Hercegovina, obervers warned.
"There is no change in the deployment inside the three-kilometre  (two-mile) total exclusion zone," UNPROFOR spokesman Rob Annink said Monday,  referring to a UN-declared exclusion zone around the valley town, which is  populated mostly by Moslems, including thousands of refugees from Serb "ethnic  cleansing" of nearby villages.
"It is a disappointment that the Bosnian Serb army did not react to the  agreement," Major Annink said.
Under the agreement signed Saturday between Lieutenant General Sir Michael   Rose, the commander of UN troops in Bosnia, and Bosnian Serb military leader  Manojlo Milovanovic, the Serbs were to redeploy the 150 men outside the  exclusion zone by 6:00 p.m. (1600 GMT) Sunday.
The Serbs also pledged to guarantee the UNPROFOR freedom of movement  within a 20-kilometre (12-mile) heavy weapons exclusion zone around Gorazde.
Annink said the Serbs told UN military observers that they would not be  granted freedom of movement within the exclusion zone until 570 Serbs were  allowed to leave the town and the mainly Moslem Bosnian army withdrew from a  hill overlooking Gorazde.
He said the overall situation in Gorazde was stable Sunday with Bosnian  Serb and Bosnian army troop movements reported northwest of the town.
