More than 200 Chinese construction workers,  engineers and medical personnel arrived in Beijing Monday, after fleeing the  bloody civil war in Yemen.
Some 160 Chinese workers were flown home Friday and a further 398 were  scheduled to return later Monday.
Among the latest arrivals who flew in on a chartered Boeing 767, were 34  who had been stranded in southern Yemen ever since civil war broke out on May  4. The deputy director of a Chinese medical team, Zhang Chengjian, was shot  dead during their eventual evacuation.
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said last week that China was "seriously  concerned with the worsening situation in Yemen and deeply grieved by the huge  loss in lives and property."
