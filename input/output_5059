Chinese police on Saturday broke up a demonstration  of 200 to 300 people in the Tibetan capital Lhassa who were protesting recent  tax increases, the London-based Tibetan Information Network reported.
Citing unconfirmed reports, it said "a number of demonstrators were beaten  and five people were believed to have been arrested."
The agency added that three foreigners who witnessed the confrontation had  their passports confiscated.
The reported protest was sparked by a 20 percent hike in taxes on  merchants.
The Network noted that May 23 was the 33rd anniversary of Tibet's "formal  surrender to Chinese in the 17-point agreeement of 1951" while May 24 marked  the date of a "major protest in 1993 that began as a complaint about prices  but turned into a pro-independence rally."
In neighbouring Nepal, according to the report, "fears that Tibetans might  demonstrate to mark the anniversary of the 1951 17-Point Agreement have led to  a wave of random arrests."
Citing an account from one detainee, it said some seventy Tibetans were  imprisoned for eight hours on the anniversary.
