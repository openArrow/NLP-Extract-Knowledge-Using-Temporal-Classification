The Yemen government has called a three-day  ceasefire following 15 days of fighting with southern forces, the  northern-controlled SABA news agency reported Friday.
The ceasefire will be effective from Saturday 0:00 a.m. (Friday 2100 GMT),  the agency said.
The truce was declared to mark the Moslem Al-Adha festival prior to  Sunday's celebration of the fourth anniversary of the unification of South and  North Yemen, the agency said.
Meanwhile in Aden a spokesman for the southern forces said that 1,500  northern troops had been killed Friday in clashes in concerted attacks by the  southern army in the Kharaz region west of Aden.
The spokesman said southern ground forces, backed by air and naval power,  halted an attempted northern advance on Aden. He gave no details of any  southern losses.
The death toll was the largest daily loss announced since fighting broke  out on May 5.
