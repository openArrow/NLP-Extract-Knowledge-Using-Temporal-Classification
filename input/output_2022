Two people sleeping on the pavement outside the  Pakistani High Commission (embassy) here were slightly injured by a crude bomb  tossed by two men on a motorcycle, police said Thursday.
The incident occurred late Wednesday outside the blue-domed mission  located in New Delhi's heavily guarded diplomatic enclave, police said.
Police said that two people sleeping on the pavement outside the mission  were injured in the legs by nail splinters from a homemade explosive.
People seeking visas often camp outside diplomatic missions in New Delhi  to get a head start in the serpentine queues.
The High Commission of Pakistan, with which India has fought three wars  since independence in 1947, has been the target of attacks in the past.
