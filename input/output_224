Hearts manager Sandy Clark has reacted furiously to  suggestions the Edinburgh club will play out a tame draw at Partick Thistle on  Saturday that would guarantee both clubs Premier Division football next season.
In theory either club could go down if Kilmarnock take at least a point at  Hibernian and relegation favourites St Johnstone upset the odds by scoring a  big win at Motherwell.
Hearts and Thistle sit a point clear of Kilmarnock, who are in turn a  point ahead of Saints in the third relegation place above the already doomed  Raith Rovers and Dundee.
Clark said: "I am sure Thistle will think the same as me that we are too  professional to look for a draw and, besides, one of the best ways of ensuring  at least a draw is to go for a win."
Saints manager Paul Sturrock admits his six months in Perth have been  traumatic but the former Scotland international is still looking forward to  the Saturday showdown.
He said: "We have been written off five or six times already this season  and dug ourselves back into contention.
"We have to be positive and go for a win because the worst thing to happen  would be for Hibs to beat Kilmarnock but we lose at Motherwell."
Killie too have to look after their own interests first without worrying  about others.
"What we are looking for is one last big effort from the players,"  admitted assistant manager Billy Stark.
"Hibs might have lost 4-0 to Dundee last week but professional pride will  ensure this is a tough game."
With Rangers already champions, Falkirk are in pole position to win the  first division title and promotion ahead of Dunfermline. Victory at Clydebank  would clinch it.
"We don't have to lift the players this week, rather it's a case of  calming them down," said Falkirk manager Jim Jefferies.
