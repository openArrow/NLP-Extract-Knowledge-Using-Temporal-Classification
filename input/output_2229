Romario has no doubts about who the biggest stars of  this summer's World Cup finals will be: "Roberto Baggio, Hristo Stoichkov,  Faustino Asprilla and me, of course," he responds.
Confidence has never been a problem for the little Barcelona striker who  will lead Brazil's attack in the United States.
And in the unlikely event of the 28-year-old ever enjoying a brief moment  of self-doubt, he can always take comfort in the testimony of Johan Cruyff,  the Barcelona coach.
"Romario has the technique of a Marco Van Basten and the striker's nose of  Gerd Muller," Cruyff said. "He doesn't like to work too hard during a match  but he can make up for it by scoring three times in five minutes."
Romario was gagged, like the rest of his Barcelona team-mates, by AC Milan  in the European Cup final but he vowed never to let it happen again.
When PSV Eindhoven, the Dutch club who brought Romario to Europe in 1988,  decided they had had enough of Romario nobody but Cruyff was prepared to touch  the temperamental Brazilian with a bargepole.
Romario has repaid that faith by scoring 30 goals, including five  hat-tricks, this season.
Being part of such a crowd pleasing, as well as winning, team clearly  suits Romario.
"I'm not the same player I was at PSV," he said. "And the reason for that  is that here I'm part of a much more skilful side than at PSV. There it was  all force with a little technique whereas at Barcelona it is exactly the  inverse."
Romario's return to form in Spain laid the ground for a triumphant return  to the international fold.
He had been dropped a year earlier after publicly insulting the national  coach Carlos Parreira who had left him out of a friendly with Germany.
Romario was recalled to the squad for the final qualifying match with  Uruguay last September.
It was a match Brazil had to win to avoid the ignominy of failing to  qualify for the the World Cup for the first time and Romario rose to the  challenge by scoring both goals.
