England have called up former hero Jonathan Callard  to replace injured full-back David Pears on their tour of South Africa.
Callard, unexpectedly axed for the trip despite starring in wins over the  All Blacks and Scotland in the Five Nations, will fly out on Monday to join a  squad still reeling from the 21-6 defeat on Saturday by Natal, and the opening  22-11 reverse by the Orange Free State.
Pears, the Harlequins' full-back renowned for being injury-prone, has a  torn rib cartilage, sustained in the Natal match.
Callard confessed: "It looks like it's going to be hard."
He added: "I'm really chuffed but it will mean sacrifices. "I was looking  forward to playing with the Baa-Baas and going to Zimbabwe."
Callard made his debut against the All Blacks at the end of last year and  then kicked England to victory over Scotland with the last kick of the game at  Murrayfield in February.
But he was then dropped for the Five Nations games against France and  Wales and overlooked as second-choice full-back when Bristol's Paul Hull was  preferred.
