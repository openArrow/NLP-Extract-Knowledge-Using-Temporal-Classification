Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) said  Friday its group pre-tax earnings plunged 47.3 percent to 139.8 billion yen  (1.4 billion dollars) in the year to March and forecast a flat year ahead.
The Japanese telcommunications giant said consolidated operating revenues  edged up 2.3 percent to 6,652 billion yen despite a decline in revenues at the  parent company which followed cuts in call rates to match rival companies.
The partly-privatised former government monopoly, which is still  two-thirds owned by the Japanese government, forecast flat earnings of 140  billion yen for the current year with revenues rising to 6,747 billion yen.
NTT said a 1.4 percent fall in parent revenue to 5,809 billion yen  followed "significant reductions in toll call rates implemented last fall to  match competitors' fee levels, and the slowdown in telephone subscription  sales.
The company also noted that operating expenses at the parent grew only 1.4  percent to 5,578 billion yen, marking the second-smallest increase ever.
"Labor costs were held down through personnel reductions. On the other  hand, increases were seen in expenses for revenue-increasing measures and  fixed-property removal costs due to network digitization," it said.
