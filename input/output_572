Houdini artists Barcelona pulled off yet another  miracle escape here on Saturday to win their fourth Spanish league title in a  row.
Johan Cruyff's side, who are also in the European Cup final, have now won  their last three championships on the final day of the Spanish season.
But they cut it fine this time, winning on goal difference after thrashing  Sevilla 5-2 while long-time leaders Deportivo La Coruna slipped up at Valencia.
Their 0-0 stalemate allowed Barcelona to join them on 56 points and steal  the title after scoring three goals to Deportivo's one in their two league  fixtures during the campaign.
Barcelona, who pipped Real Madrid to the crown in the final hours of the  preceding two seasons, went behind 1-0 and then 2-1, after Argentinian Diego  Simeone (12th minute) and Croatian Davor Suker (44) had given the visitors an  early advantage.
But the home side were put on the road to victory by Bulgarian Hristo  Stoichkov, who netted in the 20th and 49th minutes to level.
Brazilian Romario then scored his 30th goal of the season with 20 minutes  remaining and Michael Laudrup (74) and Jose Maria Bakero (88) put the icing on  the cake in the final quarter.
Deportivo's agony was deepened by the fact that they had been on top of  the league for 25 weeks -- and that the title would have given their first  domestic trophy in their history.
But this time their Brazilian striker Bebeto, with 16 goals to his credit  this season, fired blanks.
