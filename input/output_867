Machinery orders received by Japanese companies from  overseas in fiscal year to March jumped 13.9 percent from the preceding year  to 1.52 trillion yen (14.5 billion dollars), an industry association said  Monday.
Orders for power and chemical plants to Asian and Middle East countries  contributed to the increase, the Japan Industrial Machinery Association said.
The association said that machinery orders received by Japanese companies  in the 1993-94 fiscal year fell 1.8 percent to 4.75 trillion yen for the  second consecutive drop.
It attributed the decrease to a fall in earnings by companies amid the  economic slump hitting the country.
Orders from the Japanese motor vehicle industry in 1993-94 nose-dived 47.1  percent, while those from the local steel industry fell 27.9 percent, the  association said.
Machinery orders received by foreign and Japaenese companies in the fiscal  year rose 1.6 percent from 1992-93 to 6.27 trillion yen, it said.
