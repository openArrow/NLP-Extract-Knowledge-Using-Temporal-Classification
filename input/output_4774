South Africa would abide by any decision of the  Organisation of African Unity (OAU) regarding a peace misison to strife-torn  Rwanda, Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said Friday.
Speaking to journalists here, Nzo said the government had not yet taken a  decision about sending troops to help end the conflict in the central African  state.
"We are still discussing the matter and no decision has yet been reached,"  Nzo said. "But we are ready to assist and there may be other ways of assisting  Rwanda, such as caring for refugees."
Nzo said if the OAU decided to create a regional peace-keeping force,  South Africa was prepared to play its part.
South Africa was Wednesday admitted as the 53rd member of the OAU after  historic all-race elections in April saw Nelson Mandela being sworn in on May  10 as the country's first black president.
