Switzerland's Tony Rominger won his  sixth stage in the Tour of Spain here on Saturday, all but guaranteeing a  record-breaking hat-trick of wins in the event.
The 1992 and 1993 winner, who has led this year's race since the opening  time trial, triumphed again in a 53km solo ride against the clock.
Barring accidents, he should make history on Sunday in the final leg. No  rider has ever won the Vuelta three times in succession.
