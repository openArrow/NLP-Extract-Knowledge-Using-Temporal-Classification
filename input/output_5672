Vietnamese Communist Party secretary-general Do Muoi  has sent a message of sympathy to the widow of former East German head of  state Erich Honecker, who died in Chile on Sunday, it was reported Tuesday.
The army newspaper Quan Doi Nhan said in an editorial that Honecker had  devoted his life to the struggle for the aims and interests of the masses. He  held an "affectionate place" in the hearts of the Vietnamese people, said the  paper, the only one to comment on his death.
The former East Germany provided considerable aid to Vietnam during the  Cold War and tens of thousands of Vietnamese were sent to the country to work  or study. Honecker visited Vietnam in April 1975.
