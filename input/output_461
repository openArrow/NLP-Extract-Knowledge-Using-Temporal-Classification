Taiwanese police Saturday smashed a major drugs  ring when they arrested seven people suspected of smuggling 150 kilograms of  heroin worth 188.6 million US dollars into the country.
The seven -- five Taiwanese and two Singaporeans -- are accused of  trafficking in heroin they brought into Taiwan from Thailand, police said.
Police in the southern city of Kaohsiung swooped on some of the Taiwanese  suspects as they allegedly peddled the drug at their homes, while the others  were seized in a a bowling alley in the city.
The Taiwanese include suspected heroin wholesaler Chou Chih-kang, 43, and  a woman, Chang Wei-lun, 19.
The two Singaporeans -- Tan Guan-hsiou, 37, and Hok Wei-min, 26 -- were  arrested in Taipei, police said, adding that 38 kilograms of heroin were found  in the seven suspects' homes.
The Singaporeans claimed they were hired by a Hong Kong man to smuggle the  drug three months ago.
The seven were sent to the district prosecutor's office for charges to be  filed.
Taiwan usually imposes life sentences in jail and the death penalty on  drug smugglers and traders.
