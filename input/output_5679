A man in a wheelchair armed only with a  kitchen knife held up a southern French bank but threw the loot to the winds  while trying to make a getaway, police said on Tuesday.
The man, physically handicapped and aged 24, parked his wheelchair outside  the bank in a town off the Mediterranean coast and dragged himself painfully  inside where he threatened a clerk with the knife.
Brandishing a small leather satchel and saying he had a bomb, he demanded  "the takings".
The terrified cashier handed him some 30,OOO francs (about 5,500 dollars)  but police officers quickly caught up with the robber in a wheelchair, who  scattered the notes to the wind, almost causing a riot on the streets.
Police said the man had been placed in a psychiatric institution because  he was not very coherent.
