South Africa's weapons industry is expecting a  major boost from the lifting of the United Nations arms embargo, the state  armaments corporation said Thursday.
"One of the most exciting aspects of the lifting of the arms boycott is  the prospect of substantially increasing the exports of defence equipment,"  said Tielman de Waal, general manager of the state-owned Armscor.
The UN Security Council voted on Wednesday to overturn resolutions  prohibiting the sale of weapons to South Africa and the purchase of weapons  from South Africa.
De Waal said that even during the years of the UN arms embargo South  Africa's arms exports had climbed to "more than 800 million rand (216 million  dollars) per annum."
He told a media briefing that it was hoped that this figure would climb to  more than one billion rand (273 million dollars) before the end of 1994.
South Africa is acknowledged to have a selection of world-class arms and  De Waal said Armscor would concentrate on niche marketing.
He named four areas where he felt South Africa's weapons were  "battle-proven" world leaders:
-- artillery, particularily the G5 and G6 155 millimetre canons,
-- the Rooikat (Caracal) armoured fighting vehicle
-- the Rooivalk (Red Falcon) combat helicopter
-- mine-resistant vehicles and mine-clearing equipment.
De Waal said Armscor would market "mainly in the Far East and Middle East,  but South Africa also has the opportunity to go into Europe."
"We think that our products can compete with the Europeans," he said.
The Rooivalk attack helicopter was recently exhibited in Britain, where it  is competing against other international contractors for a Royal Air Force  contract.
De Waal echoed President Nelson Mandela's comments that South Africa would  not market irresponsibly and would only sell arms to countries that were  threatened by outside forces.
