England prospect David May signed a four-year  contract with English double winners Manchester United on Monday.
The 23-year-old defender resisted a last-ditch rescue package, put  together by Blackburn Rovers' multi-millionaire chairman Jack Walker, to keep  him at Ewood Park.
Now the bitterly-contested move looks set to require a tribunal to settle  the price for the player, rated at around two million pounds.
Oldham-born May, who supported United as a boy, will boost his new club's  renewed attempt to win the European Cup next season.
Last year they were hampered by the rule limiting foreign players and were  eliminated in the second round by Turkish champions Galatasaray.
United manager Alex Ferguson said: "It is vital that we bring in more  Englishmen and this was a position in which we were a bit weak."
May, one of the few home-grown players in Kenny Dalglish's side which  pushed United so closely for the title, said: "It is a step forward for me and  will give me a better chance of England recognition."
His agent, Paul Stretford, said:  "We had eight months trying to sort  something out with Blackburn and it took just two hours to get satisfaction  from United."
Ferguson was not surprised that he was able to tempt May to join United's  5,000 to 12,000 pound a week high-rollers, adding: "Sometimes when you produce  a young player they tend to get left behind in the salary stakes."
"We tried to get in touch with Blackburn but got no reply when we inquired  about a fee.
"I just hope we can settle it amicably without having to resort to a  tribunal."
