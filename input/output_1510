A poll released Wednesday showed that 51.1 percent  of the Japanese were in favour of holding new general elections as soon as  parliament approves stalled national budget bills for the current fiscal year.
Debate on budget bills, stalled since early March, is expected to end by  the end of June with cooperation between Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's  minority coalition government and opposition parties.
A survey conducted by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said that popular support  for Hata's cabinet, formed last month, stood at 42.2 percent.
That compared with 69.6 percent backing given to the cabinet of Hata's  predecessor, Morihiro Hosokawa, in a similar survey conducted by the newspaper  shortly after Hosokawa took office last August.
The latest survey showed that 31 percent of 3,000 eligible voters polled  from May 13-15 said they did not support Hata, who was forced to form the  nation's first minority government in 39 years.
Forty-five percent of respondents criticised the current cabinet for  instability, while 44 percent said they did not understand the government's  policies.
