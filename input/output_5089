Japanese designer Kenzo is to celebrate the first  day of summer on June 21 in his own special way  - by decking out Paris' Pont  Neuf across the Seine in flowers.
He will cover the bridge from the Quai du Louvre across to the Quai Conti  with 32,000 pots of different coloured begonias as well as various kinds of  ivy in a task expected to take three days to complete.
After one day and one night of celebrations, which will take in a music  festival, the bridge will be "deflowered".
In 1985, US-Bulgarian artist Christo wrapped the same bridge in material.
