Spain's Carlos Sainz took full  advantage of the disqualification of his team-mate Colin McRae to win the  Acropolis rally here on Tuesday.
The victory lifted the Subaru driver level with world champion Juha  Kankkunen, of Finland, at the top of the world championship standings.
Sainz finished 4min 1sec ahead of Germany's Armin Schwartz (Mitsubishi)  and 5min 53sec ahead of Kankkunen's Toyota.
McRae was thrown out of the race on Monday after deliberately blocking the  road for 20 minutes while he replaced a windscreen he said had been smashed  because of officials' negligence.
He said the scrutineers failed to fasten down the bonnet after sampling  petrol at a time check and it later blew open and smashed the windscreen.
The Scot could face an international ban for his actions. The Automobile  and Touring Club of Greece's Board of Stewards has reported the Scot to the  Royal Automobile Club and the International Automobile Federation for  unsporting conduct.
