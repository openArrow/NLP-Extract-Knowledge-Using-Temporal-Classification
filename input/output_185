An appeal court in this French southeastern  city Friday threw out an appeal by Mayor Michel Noir against a bail order  served when he was charged with embezzling public funds this year.
The court also upheld a judicial control order also served in March  against Noir, a prominent conservative politician alleged to have embezzled  one million dollars to finance his political activities.
The 49-year-old former trade minister and mayor of France's second largest  city was once viewed as potential presidential contender but his political  future dimmed after the March charges.
He was ordered at the time to put up bail of 2.4 million francs (420,000  dollars).
Noir's lawyers said they take the matter to a higher court.
