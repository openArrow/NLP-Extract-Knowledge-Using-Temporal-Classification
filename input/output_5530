Second-placed Colin McRae faced a  crippling time penalty here on Monday after an extraordinary bust-up with race  officials in the Acropolis rally.
The Scot, seven seconds behind leading Subaru teammate Carlos Sainz at the  end of the second stage, was being threatened with a 14min 30sec penalty for  delaying a special stage start after his windscreen was smashed.
Race officials were meeting on Monday to discuss the affair after McRae  appealed.
The driver blamed race officials for failing to close his bonnet, which  then blew open, smashing his windscreen and threatening to make him miss the  start of the 16th special stage.
The driver retaliated by blocking the road with his car for 29 minutes  while repairs were carried out.
The provisional times at the end of Monday's racing showed Sainz and  McRae in first and second and they were followed by German Armin Schwarz in  his Mitsubishi Lancer, 4:25 behind.
Malcolm Wilson (Ford Escort) was next, another 30 seconds back and world  champion Juha Kankkunen of Finland 6:13 off the pace in his Toyota Celica.
Dider Auriol of France, the 1992 winner, was forced to retire his Toyota  with engine trouble while in second place.
