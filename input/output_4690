World number one batsman Brian Lara's hopes of a  record-equalling sixth successive first class hundred were destroyed by a  teenager at Lord's on Friday.
Middlesex pace bowler Richard Johnson, 19, had the West Indian ace caught  behind down the leg-side by Keith Brown for 26.
Lara began his run spree with a Test record of 375 against England and  then scored four tons in a row for his new county.
He had gone into Warwickshire's County Championship, match aiming to equal  a world record jointly held by Don Bradman, C B Fry and Mike Procter.
Johnson had dismissed Lara at Lord's for 34 during a Benson and Hedges Cup  match earlier this month.
