US Secretary of State Warren Christopher will  visit the first autonomous Palestinian enclave of Jericho on Tuesday, a  Palestinian leader said.
"We expect Christopher on Tuesday morning in Jericho," said Saeb Erekat,  who lives in the West Bank town and has been appointed to the new Palestinian  Authority which will run Jericho and the Gaza Strip.
Christopher will be the first senior foreign dignitary to tour the town  since Israeli forces withdrew on Friday.
The secretary is set to arrive in Jerusalem on Monday from Damascus as he  makes another bid to bring the two countries back to the negotiating table.
