German Chancellor Helmut Kohl Monday gave  French President Francois Mitterrand a Claude Monet painting stolen by Nazi  troops during World War II, French and German sources said.
The untitled painting, showing the snow-covered Louveciennes road west of  Paris dates from the 1870s. It is one of 28 paintings found in former east  German museums after the collapse of the Berlin wall.
Kohl asked that the painting be returned to the family who owned it, in  line with a German pleged to return all such art works to their one-time  owners, where possible.
Among the other works that found in eastern Germany are one by Delacroix,  another by Courbet, a Renoir, a Gauguin, two Georges Seurats, a Cezanne and  sketches by Corot, Millet and Manet.
Kohl and Mitterrand were meeting at Mulhouse, eastern France, for the 63rd  Franco-German summit.
