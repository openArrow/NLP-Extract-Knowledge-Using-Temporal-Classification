Japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate edged  downward from 2.9 percent in March to 2.8 percent in April, the first fall in  three months, the Management and Coordination Agency said Tuesday.
But agency officials, still concerned about the relatively high jobless  rate by Japanese standards, said the marginal fall was not necessarily a sign  of overall economic recovery.
"Although the rate actually fell, we can't predict at the moment whether  it will continue falling," an agency official said. "We want to keep closely  monitoring the figure for a while."
The number of unemployed in April rose 370,000 or 23.6 percent from a year  earlier to 1.94 million after topping two million in March for the first time  on record.
Meanwhile, the Labor Ministry said in a separate report the ratio of job  offers to job seekers remained unchanged from March at 0.66 in April, or 66  job openings for every 100 job seekers.
Ministry officials said the ratio would likely remain at the current level.
The ratio had been moving downward since March 1991 when it peaked at  1.45. It hit a low of 0.65 in December last year before rising to 0.67 in  January and dipping again to 0.65 in February.
