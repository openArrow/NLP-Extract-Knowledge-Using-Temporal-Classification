Hundreds of women appealed here Saturday for  an immediate end to clashes between Kurdish factions that have claimed more  than 100 lives, after marching for four days across northern Iraq.
The 300 women arrived in the city of Arbil at the end of a peace march of  around 250 kilometres (150 miles) from Sulaymaniyeh, near the Iranian border.
"We represent the mothers, sisters and wives of the martyrs of our cities.  We urge you to remember your historical responsibility to all the Kurdish  people," they said in a petition.
"Stop the fighting, or history will never forgive you."
Nergez Abdulrahman, dressed in black from head to toe, told AFP that three  of her brothers had been taken prisoner and shot dead. "The whole town came to  the funeral, to demonstrate their indignation," she said.
A schoolteacher from Suleymaniyeh, Nazanin Mohammad Rashid, said the women  would stage a sit-in outside the Kurdish parliament in Arbil until it met to  halt the bloodshed.
"Why don't they all sit down together to solve the problem?" she asked.
The clashes between the two main factions of northern Iraq, the Kurdistan  Democratic Party (KDP) and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), erupted in  early May and have split Iraqi Kurdistan into two, including Arbil itself.
PUK militiamen have seized control of the parliament building, triggering  a boycott of the house by KDP deputies.
Fresh clashes have been reported near the Iranian border, where the PUK is  strong, despite three ceasefire accords and the setting up of a joint  committee to supervise a ceasefire.
International organisations have threatened to cut off aid to northern  Iraq,
which is controlled by the Kurds in defiance of Baghdad, unless the  factions halt the fighting.
