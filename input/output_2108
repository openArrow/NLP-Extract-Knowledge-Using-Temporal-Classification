Foreigners desperate to escape Aden crowded  the docks in the baking sun Thursday, as the rival Yemeni armies battled their  way into a third week of civil war.
The struggle between President Ali Abdallah Saleh's northern troops and  those of his southern rival Vice President Ali Salem al-Baid was concentrated  for the fourth day running on Al-Anad, a giant air base 60 kilometres (36  miles) north of here.
An AFP correspondent reported that Baid's troops were defending the base  from its southern perimetre against onslaughts from northern rivals on the  other side in a battle which has become the focal point of the war.
There were heavy artillery exchanges around the base and in nearby  mountains and automatic weapons fire could be heard from inside.
Aid workers also reported heavy fighting further east at Abyan, where  around 100 wounded were admitted to hospitals on Thursday alone.
Foreigners still stranded in Baid's stronghold Aden flocked to the docks  desperate for a boat passage out, with all roads to the north blocked and the  airport closed. About 300 arrived early to complete lengthy customs  regulations.
One group was trying to get aboard a Russian ship ready to set off, and  the others had been impatiently waiting since the beginning of the week for an  Indian boat to unload its cargo of corn.
"Each morning we come here, we wait and in the evening we return to our  hotel," one of them said.
The Russian consul and his Chinese counterpart, the only two diplomats  still remaining in the city, were trying to process their nationals as the  temperature climbed to 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit).
A Belgian businessman, known to everyone just as Patrick, was trying to  deal with all the other foreign nationals, mainly Indians, Americans, Iranians  and Belgians as well as a few Yemenis.
The fighting around Aden was jeopardising plans to send a UN relief convoy  to Somali refugees trapped in crossfire at the al-Kud camp on a beach near  Zinjibar, 50 kilometers (32 miles) northeast of the city.
Rolf Guldberg, UN High Commissioner for Refugees representative in Sanaa,    said the camp was in a "war zone" and supplies would only be sent once  fighting eased.  He hoped it would set off from Sanaa in the next few days.
The United Nations had no precise figure on the total number of Somali  refugees or casualties but would be trying to provide food for 4,000, the  estimated number there before the Yemeni civil began on May 5.
The refugees say hundreds have died in the crossfire.
The Somalis fled to Yemen to escape the civil war which erupted in their  Horn of Africa country three years ago, but have now found themselves caught  up in a new conflict.
Hundreds of refugees meanwhile flooded into Aden fleeing fighting in the  surrounding mountains and countryside.
The United Nations said there were at least 1,500 in Aden, and it was  providing them with food.
Meanwhile, a senior official from the International Committee of the Red  Cross (ICRC) said they had already started to visit prisoner of war camps, and  hoped to complete the inspections next week.
Arnold Luethold, regional ICRC director for the Arabian peninsula, gave no  precise figure for war casualties or internees but said they had counted  hundreds of POWs.
