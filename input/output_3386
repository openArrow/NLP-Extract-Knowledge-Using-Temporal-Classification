The last of the wartime Liberty Ships to have  ferried troops across the Channel to the Normandy beachheads arrived in  Britain Monday to take part in the 50th anniversary commemorations next month.
The Jeremiah O'Brien is one of the few survivors of the 2,751 Liberty  ships turned out by American yards between 1941 and 1945 faster than enemy  submarines could sink them.
The 10,000 ton vessel left San Francisco, California, with a crew in their  seventies, on April 19. Built in 1943 in Portland, Maine, it had spent the  last 14 years being restored to original condition.
Captain George Jahn, who commanded another Liberty Ship on convoys during  the war, said on arrival at Portsmouth, "It was a beautiful trip, nice and  smooth."
"At least this time around we didn't have to worry about submarines," he  added, recalling that on one wartime trip he had seen another Liberty ship  sailing alongside being blown into three pieces.
