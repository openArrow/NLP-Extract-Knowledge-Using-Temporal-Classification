Twenty-one people were killed late Sunday when  two minibus taxis and a truck collided at Leeuw Gamka, about 400 kilometres  (240 miles), from here on the main road to Johannesburg, police said Monday.
A police spokesman, describing the accident as "very, very horrific," said  the two taxis crashed into each other before being hit by the truck, which  dragged one of the minibuses 150 metres (yards) down the road.
Bodies were strewn across the road, the spokesman said, adding that seven  people were also injured in the collision.
