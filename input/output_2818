The Utah Jazz staved off a  potentially humiliating defeat Saturday with 91-81 victory over Denver to  reach the semi-finals of the National Basketball Association playoffs.
Karl Malone scored 31 points, hitting 21 of 23 shots, and also grabbed 14  rebounds as Utah earned a Western Conference finals clash with Houston.
The Jazz had led 3-0 in the best-of-seven series before Denver rallied to  level 3-3. If they had lost, Utah would have become the first team in the  history of the NBA to lose a playoff after leading 3-0.
Jeff Hornacek scored 18 points for the Jazz while Reggie Williams had 17  and Brian Williams had 13 for Denver.
The Nuggets upset the Seattle SuperSonics in the first round, becoming the  first eighth-seeded team to beat a top-seeded team in the playoffs.
Their comeback against the Jazz matched the exploits of the 1951 New York  Knicks who rallied to level their series with Rochester 3-3 but like the  Nuggets lost game seven.
