Two gunmen opened fire in a  restaurant, killing one person, wounding several others and holding a group of  lunchtime diners hostage for six hours before surrendering.
First reports said the shooting began as part of a bungled holdup, but  some witnesses said the two men began firing without warning.
A five-year-old boy was critically injured by gunfire, one of at least  four persons wounded, officials said.
Police sealed off the area around the Denny's restaurant with  sharpshooters and helicopters as the gunmen gradually released the 25 hostages  and finally surrendered.
Witnesses said one of the men had a .357-caliber handgun and the other an  assault rifle resembling an Israeli-made Uzi.
The boy wounded in the face underwent three hours of surgery and remained  in critical condition at Community Hospital North, a spokesman said.
