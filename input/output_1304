A thick cloud of pollution hung over the Greek  capital Tuesday for the second day running, sending 160 people to hospital  while residents ignored government pleas to leave cars at home.
Coupled with weather hitting 30 degrees Celsius (85 degrees Fahrenheit),  levels of ozone and other toxic gasses soared well above danger limits. By  midday, 160 people had been rushed to emergency rooms with heart and  respiratory trouble or fainting.
The environment ministry has urged residents since Monday to keep traffic  to a minumum but it appeared to have had no affect on the busy downtown area  Tuesday.
The ministry said it would announce a new plan next week to fight the  cloud of pollution, which Greeks call the "nefos" and has plagued the capital  periodically for more than 10 years.
Previous governments have proposed various plans to help ease the problem  but so far to no avail.
The health ministry meanwhile said two hospitals would run a special  non-stop service this summer to care for people who succumb to the double blow  of pollution and heat.
