Iran has strongly protested the siege of its  pilgrimage quarter in Mecca by Saudi security forces, saying it had disrupted  the pilgrimage procedure, the official Iranian news agency IRNA said.
The Iranian embassy in Riyadh sent a "strongly-worded" letter to the Saudi  foreign ministry to protest against the seige, it said.
"The siege has disrupted the affairs of our people ahead of the pilgrimage  period," the embassy said.
Special Saudi riot police were stationed around the camp earlier this week  after Iran announced it was determined to hold an anti-US and anti-Israel  rally infront of the building on Tuesday.
Iran on Tuesday called off the rally under the threat of force from Saudi  Arabia.
