Teams waited 5 1/2 hours until the final 30 minutes of the qualifying  session, seeking the coolest weather to help their bids.
Greco's 1994 Lola-Cosworth ran out of gas on the inner pit lane, forcing  the former Formula 3000 driver to watch and listen to updates on his radio  until he was retrieved after qualifying ended.
"I came around the second turn after my final qualifying lap and the  dashboard went blank," Greco said. "I was calm, because there was nothing I  could do."
Dick Simon, who owns Greco's car, led a celebration despite the absent  driver. He placed a record six cars into the race.
"It was a shame he missed the excitement," Simon said. "We were all so  high after having sweated it out."
Even though Greco bumped him out of the lineup, Goodyear might yet make a  comeback. Davy Jones qualified a backup car for the same team and owner Kenny  Bernstein will decide this week whether to pull Jones from the car and insert  Goodyear.
"We will evaluate it long and hard," Bernstein said. "I cannot commit to a  timetable."
Smith's desperate final bid to reach his first Indy 500 ended with a crash  on his first qualifying lap. The right tires of his 1994 Lola-Cosworth  scrubbed the outer wall on the first turn, starting a spin that ended when the  car's left side slammed into the outer wall of turn two.
France's Stephan Gregoire, Belgium's Didier Theys and Scotland's Jim  Crawford never reached competitive speed and did not attempt to qualify. Jeff  Andretti, Mario's youngest son, and Buddy Lazier each made late switches to  new cars but never challenged for a starting spot.
