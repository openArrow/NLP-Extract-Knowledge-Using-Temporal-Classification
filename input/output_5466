The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) on Monday decided to  ignore a Serbian application to join, although Bosnia has been invited to  attend its foreign ministers' conference, the Egyptian news agency MENA said.
Nabil Arabi, Egypt's representative to the United Nations, said during a  preliminary meeting that NAM members would not discuss Serbia's request.
Meanwhile, Bosnian Foreign Minister Erfan Ljubijankic arrived in Cairo to  attend the conference, which runs Tuesday to Friday, as a guest of the host  country.
Serbia and Bosnia are vying for the former Yugoslavia's seat in the  organisation. Yugoslavia was a founding and influential member of the group of  more than 100 developing countries.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Mussa has said Serbia was not the "sole  legitimate heir" of Yugoslavia and that it had violated international law with  its "aggression" against Bosnian Moslems.
