The focus for disaster relief has largely swung  from Africa and Asia to the countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet  bloc, the British Red Cross (BRC) said Tuesday.
Now there were hardly any "natural" disasters, and relief agencies were  most in demand to help victims of man-made calamities, including refugees and  displaced people hit by civil wars and economic collapse, exacerbated by harsh  weather, it said.
Federation secretary-general George Weber reported: "In the very few years  since the end of the Cold War, following the collapse of the Soviet Union and  with the war in the former Yugoslavia and escalating uncertainties in eastern  Europe, the traditional Asian and African focus of international disaster  response has swung sharply from the south to the north.
"For many agencies ... this has meant a massive shift in the balance of  relief resources since 1990, away from Africa and the Indian sub-continent and  towards Europe and the newly independent states."
The BRC was launching in London the World Disasters Report 1994, by the  International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, which said  that relief agencies were being pushed to their limits trying to help the  250-300 million people a year affected by disasters.
The trend was of an annual growth of 10 million affected people, it said.
