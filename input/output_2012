Despite a ten-day strike and some desertions among  its British-trained instructors, the training of soldiers for Mozambique's new  unified new army is going well, British sources said Thursday.
British defence attache in Maputo Colonel John Wyatt told AFP: "I'm sure  its true a few instructors have gone missing, but the number is small, and the  strike at Boane training center ended yesterday".
Some 180 Mozambican instructors of the new army, composed of government  soldiers and former rebels of the Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO),  were on strike for 10 days, demanding unpaid wages.
Observers of Mozambique's peace process fear this is an ominous precedent  for the new army, which few government soldiers wish to join due to the bad  experience and poor conditions of their army life so far.
But Wyatt said: "The new army training in Manhica and Dondo centres is  going extremely well, and I'm sure will do so in Boane, now the instructors  have been paid".
Training of 2,000 soldiers for the first three infantry battalions of  Mozambique's new army is due to end on June 3.
The government and RENAMO are still selecting a further 4,200 soldiers to  start training at the end of June.
However, Mozambique is still waiting for Zimbabwe to decide whether or not  it will send extra instructors to help with the training of some 15,000  soldiers altogether.
Under the terms of a 1992 peace accord between the government and RENAMO,  the new army should have 30,000 members, but so far the country has only  raised money or found accomodation for 15,000.
