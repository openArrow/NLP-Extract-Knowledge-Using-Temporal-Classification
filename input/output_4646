President Nelson Mandela said Friday that  political conflict in South Africa had become a thing of past with the  installation of the democratic government of national unity.
"We have put the conflicts of the past behind us and all South Africans  are working together to address the national problems," Mandela told the  Senate, in his maiden speech to the upper house of parliament.
"As fellow South Africans, we are bound together by a common loyalty to  South Africa and the issues which unite us are more important than those which  divide us," he said.
"The last four days are perhaps the most exciting and unforgettable in my  political life," he said, referring to the first working session of the new  parliament.
Mandela said he was prepared to go out of his way to achieve unity and  peace in the country, and for this reason he was prepared to meet neo-Nazi  leader Eugene Terre'Blanche on Monday.
"I will go on my knees for peace in this country," he said.
Mandela said the government of national unity would ensure that it would  be impossible to implement "radical and unpopular policies."
