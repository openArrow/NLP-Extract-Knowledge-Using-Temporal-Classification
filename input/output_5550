Canada ranks first among industrialized  countries for life expectancy, education and buying power in this year's UN  index of human development, according to a report published Wednesday.
Barbados led developing countries in the Human Development Index which  tracked progress in 173 countries, according to the UN Development Program's  (UNDP) study.
A new measure which follows the index over a longer period -- from 1960 to  1992 -- showed Malaysia and Botswana with the most progress followed by South  Korea, Tunisia and Thailand.
East Asia had the fasted growing economies, according to the report, which  stressed the need for addressing social needs when planning development  strategies.
"This shows that the fast pace of economic growth in East Asia was built  on a solid foundation of human development," said the report, entitled Human  Development 1994.
The researchers called for new approaches to planning and spending  worldwide and proposed a world social development summit in Copenhagen in  March 1995.
"It will be a time to reiterate very clearly that, without the promotion  of people-centered development, none of our key objectives can be met -- not  peace, not human rights not environmental protection," said James Speth who  directed the study.
