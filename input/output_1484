The Israeli army early Wednesday  pulled out of its last positions in Gaza City, completing its withdrawal from  the autonomous Palestinian territories of the Gaza Strip and Jericho, an AFP  correspondent said.
Soldiers fired teargas at jeering youths as they left the military  adminstration building, the police station and the Hof military camp, where  the Border Guards were stationed.
Street celebrations at their departure ended in the same kind of  confrontation between Palestinian youths and soldiers that had marked more  than six years of Palestinian resistance since the intifada, or uprising,  began in December 1987.
After 27 years of occupation, albeit 35 days behind the April 13 deadline  agreed in the historic outline accord on Palestinian autonomy Israel signed  with the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in Washington last September  13, security in the territories passed over to the Palestinian police.
General Izthak Aharonovitz, commander of the Border Guards, dismissed the  last minute confrontation.
He told AFP: "It was a group of Hamas and Islamic Jihad extremists who  wanted to sour the taste of our departure. They do not represent the majority  of the people who want to live together.
"We wanted to hand the positions over to the Palestinian police without  incident," he said.
Colonel Shaoul Arieli, commander of the northern Gaza Strip, said: "I am  happy to be leaving. Now they are taking control of their own lives. It is the  beginning of the peace process between our two peoples."
Arieli, brought in to supervise the withdrawal, said he had handed the  positions over to representatives of the Palestinian police.
A senior Palestinian policeman told AFP that 850 officers from Jordan and  Egypt had come in overnight to take up their positions.
