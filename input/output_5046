Several dozen Cubans slipped past guards and  entered the Belgian ambassador's residence here Saturday to seek asylum,  witnesses said.
Witnesses said the group of people, young and old alike, gathered in a  square alongside the residence in Havana's posh Miramar district, and then  slipped into the compound when guards were not looking.
Cuban authorities were patrolling the area outside the residence Saturday  afternoon.The Belgian ambassador, Paul Vermeirsch, could not immediately be  reached for comment.
It was not the first time asylum-seekers cast an eye on the Belgian  diplomatic residence.
On January 26, eight Cubans entered the residence and requested political  asylum in Belgium. In late February they finally accepted a deal in which they  agreed to leave the building after Belgium secured formal assurances from  Cuban authorities that the eight would face no charges.
Cuba routinely denies the right to exit the country to Cuban nationals who  try to leave by seeking asylum in diplomatic facilities.
