A total trade embargo which excludes only  food and medicines went into effect against Haiti at midnight Saturday (04:00  GMT Sunday) following the refusal of the country's military rulers to step  down.
An AFP correspondent in Port-au-Prince said the situation there was calm  with ordinary people resigned to the hardships ahead.
Up the last moment, dockers worked to unload hundreds of containers  bringing goods ordered hastily from abroad in the hope of holding out for the  next few months.
The government of provisional president Emile Jonassaint said Saturday  that a special commission had been set up to deal with the sanctions crisis.
The Security Council approved the embargo on May 6 to force the Haitian  military regime to restore democracy and permit the return of deposed elected  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide now exiled in Washington.
The embargo adds to an trade embargo by the Organisation or American  States imposed in October 1991 and a UN oil embargo imposed last year.  An  estimated 200,000 jobs have been lost because of sanctions up to now in a  country where 60 percent of the workforce is unemployed.
Haitis peasant farmers have been hard-hit by the halt to exports of coffee  and cocoa and of mangoes to the US market.
Aid workers and religious groups say sanctions have killed "far more" than  10,000 people in vulnerable groups, mainly children, women, the sick and the  elderly and caused irreparable damage to the environment.
Meanwhile an opinion poll published Saturday in the United States showed  that 68 percent of Americans opposed US military intervention in Haiti to  overturn the military regime.
President Bill Clinton is under strong pressure from a small but  influential minority which favours a military solution to the crisis in Haiti.
