Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao was  beginning his US trip by meeting Sunday with the Indian community in New York.
Rao, who arrived in the Big Apple on Saturday on the first US tour by an  Indian premier since Rajiv Gandhi came here in 1987, was also to visit Houston  and Boston and give a lecture at Harvard before arriving in Washington  Wednesday.
The Indian prime minister's two-day stay in Washington will include a  speech to a joint session of congress, and a two- and-a-half-hour session with  President Bill Clinton.
The two men are scheduled to hold a joint press conference after their  meeting Thursday.
Rao, 73, is also scheduled to have talks with Defense Secretary William  Perry, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
The visit comes at a time of tension between the two countries over a  number of issues, notably India's ambitious nuclear and missile programmes,  Kashmir, human rights and trade.
US officials have said they hope the trip will bring better understanding  between the two sides, but they are not expecting it to result in any  breakthrough announcements.
Washington is urging both India and Pakistan to put a cap on their nuclear  programs in the interests of non-proliferation in the region.
But Rao is under tremendous domestic pressure to resist US calls to cap  the nuclear program and freeze its missile defence programme, and the  Washington trip is his most controversial foreign visit in three years in  office.
The carrot for Pakistan is the possibility of obtaining delivery of F-16  fighter planes it has already paid for but which were frozen by Congress -- a  prospect that angers India, which has fought three wars with Pakistan since  partition in 1947.
With India there is not such obvious quid pro quo, but there are areas in  which the United States could offer more help, such as science and technology  transfers, US officials say.
