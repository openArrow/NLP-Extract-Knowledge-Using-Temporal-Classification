An Ivory Coast student jailed in March following a  violent demonstration saw his term doubled from one year to two by an appeal  court, judicial sources said Wednesday.
The court also upheld a ruling that Eugene Gonty, a second-year philosophy  student, should pay damages of nine million CFA francs (15,500 dollars) to the  vice-rector of Bouake University in the centre of the country.
News of the judgement came a day after students at Bouake and in Ivory  Coast's two other universities in the economic capital Abidjan began a new  strike to press for the release of Gonty and 15 other detained students.
The strike call by the officially dissolved student union FESCI was widely  followed at the two universities in Abidjan, where police and paramilitary  police were deployed and all classes were cancelled.
Apart from calling for the "immediate and unconditional release" of their  colleagues, students told AFP they wanted canteens opened and details of  grants released.
Before Gonty was jailed in March, three other students were sentenced in  November, each for a year following violent protest demonstrations, while the  cases of the 12 other detainees are being investigated.
Tuition had resumed in Abidjan only a week ago after a previous strike by  students, who were warned by authorities that the academic year could be  written off. The year began, late, in February and is due to end in August.
About 50,000 students attend classes at the universities of  Abidjan-Cocody, Abidjan-Abobo and Bouake.
