Malawi's provisional constitution will be voted  into law by parliament before next week's multi-party general elections.
Lovemore Munlo, chairman of the all-party National Consultative Council  (NCC) which is overseeing Malawi's transition to political pluralism, told  journalists here Thursday that parliament is likely to meet May 15 to endorse  the constitution.
Munlo, who is the country's attorney-general and justice minister, said  the constitution will come into force after the new government takes power  after the May 17 polls.
He said a parliamentary committee will collect and examine the public's  comments and criticism of the provisional constitution, and a definitive basic  law will be drawn up within a year.
