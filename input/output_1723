Britain on Wednesday promised to help Zimbabwe  fight AIDS through a nine million pound (13.5 million dollar) health care  project, the Overseas Development Administration (ODA) announced.
The announcement was made after Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, here on  a three-day state visit, met with Prime Minister John Major.
The ODA said an estimated one million Zimbabweans carry the HIV virus  which causes AIDS, and the five-year health project would help establish  treatment and prevention programs.
