Award-winning writer Kazuo Ishiguro, a  member of the Cannes film festival jury, paid tribute Friday to Japanese  cinema, saying it strongly influenced his appreciation of the art even now.
Japanese-born Ishiguro, who has lived in Britain since the age of five,  said his love for his native land's films would have made it difficult for him  to be on the jury here if a Japanese entry had been in competition.
"If you asked me to name my favourite movies, some of the Japanese  classics would figure very highly. Films like 'Seven Samurai,' 'Tokyo Story',"  he said, in an interview with AFP.
Asked about the influence of this on his role as juror, he said: "It  certainly has some bearing, in so far as Japanese movies are very important to  me ... but there are no Japanese films in competition."
Ishiguro is on the 10-member jury which has been viewing two or three  films a day since last Wednesday, judging each ahead of the awarding of the  Cannes festival's top Palm award Monday evening.
Ishiguro, who was born in Nagasaki in 1954, achieved a certain notoriety  at the start of this year's film festival here by saying he could not name his  top three all-time favourite films.
Asked about Monday's Palm awards decision, Ishiguro said that in his view  only a handful of films were left in the running for the Golden Palm, addding  that he hoped the winner would appeal to the "enthusiastic amateur."
"On Monday I suspect it will come down to a handful. I cant speak for  other members of the jury. But as you watch the films in competition certain  ones eliminate themselves as you go along," he said.
He said he was judging the films "as a kind of enthusiastic amateur ...  the questions I'm asking are does it move, me, do I find it funny, sad, does  it bore me."
Ishiguro's Booker Prize-winning novel "Remains of the Day" has been made  into a box-office hit by English filmmakers Merchant-Ivory.
