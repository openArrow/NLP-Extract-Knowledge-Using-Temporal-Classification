The England coach added: "I thought the first half we made some good  chances but in the second half they pulled everybody back.
"It got increasingly heavy on the pitch and the boys found it more  difficult in the second half."
Looking back over his first three games, including wins over Denmark an  Greece, Venables said: "We have got the spirit going.
"We are getting a shape to the team. There are still things to be done but  it's a beginning."
England striker Alan Shearer, who took the controversial free kick, said:
"I don't really know why the referee blew up. I took the free-kick early,  the keeper pushed it onto the post and it was an open goal for Platty. But  he's disallowed it and that's history now.
"The referee said to me that if I told him I wanted to take it early he  would have let me.
"He said that I couldn't ask him to move the wall back and then take it  quickly, but I never asked him to move the wall back.
"It is a bit disappointing. That could have won us the game. In those sort  of situations the advantage has got to be with the side that has the  free-kick."
