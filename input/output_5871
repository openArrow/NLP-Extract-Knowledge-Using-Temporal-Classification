The rector of the Bab Ezzouar Science and  Technology University in Algiers was killed Tuesday in a gun attack, security  services said.
Salah Djebaili was shot as he was about to get in his car parked a short  distance from the university campus in the eastern suburbs of the Algerian  capital, they said.
It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the attack, but  Moslem fundamentalists have been waging a war against secular intellectuals  and the military-backed government since the army moved to scrap elections in  January 1992 which the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front had been poised to  win.
More than 3,000 people have died in the fundamentalist campaign.
Algeria's current army-dominated government is led by President Liamine  Zeroual, a general who has backed "comprehensive" talks with the opposition,  including Islamic militants.
