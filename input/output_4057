French Defence Minister Francois Leotard accused  President Francois Mitterrand Wednesday of being unpatriotic in refusing to  allow nuclear weapons tests in line with a moratorium by most nuclear powers.
"The French executive must in the months to come have the courage to  decide on the resumption of nuclear tests with regard to the interests of the  country alone, and no other consideration," he told the national assembly.
Leotard, a leading member of the conservative government which is locked  in a stand-off with the socialist president over the issue, said more nuclear  tests were essential to enable France to acquire the future capacity to  simulate the behaviour of nuclear weapons by means of computers.
Leotard, speaking in a debate on a new defence bill, was applauded by  government deputies when he recalled the role of the late president Charles de  Gaulle in giving France a nuclear deterrent in the 1960s.
France, under a socialist government, decided in April 1992 to impose a  moratorium on testing at its Mururoa site in the South Pacific. Britain,  Russia and the United States have introduced similar bars though China has not.
Mitterrand, who under the constitution has sole power to decide on  testing, said recently it would not resume during the remaining year he has in  office.
Mitterrand said his successor, expected to be a conservative, would be  unable to order a resumption because his hands would be tied by the 1995  renewal of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to be followed by a nuclear  test ban treaty.
But Leotard said there was no question of France signing a test ban  treaty, currently under negotiation in Geneva, as long as it did not possess  the simulation capability.
