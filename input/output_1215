Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Shakhrai  announced Tuesday he was resigning from government one day after President  Boris Yeltsin released him from his duties as nationalities minister.
"The appointment of a new nationalities minister was done without  consulting me and therefore I request to be relieved of my duties as deputy  prime minister," Shakhrai told a news conference.
Yeltsin appointed Monday the governor of the southern Krasnodar region,  Nikolai Yegorov, to the key post of nationalities minister after Shakhrai  failed to make progress in talks aimed at defusing ethnic tension in the  troubled Caucasus region.
Leaders of the rebel Caucasus republic of Chechnya, who declared  independence from Moscow in 1991, refused to negotiate with Shakhrai who  called for new presidential elections in the republic.
During the news conference, Shakhrai criticised Yeltsin's entourage,  stating that the "situation" in the Kremlin "made it impossible to work  normally."
He said that the decision to fire him from the nationalities post was not  taken according to normal procedures but did not add details.
"I have never attempted to hold on to any seat or portfolio", he said.
Shakhrai added that his resignation did not mean that his Party of Russian  Unity and Accord would join the opposition to Yeltsin.
"We will continue to support all important measures in favor of reforms  and in particular those that can lead to the formation of a real Russian  federation," he stated.
Shakhrai, 38, was appointed to the government of Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin in December after his party won seats in the parliamentary  elections.
Over the past three years, Shakhrai emerged as an influential member of  the Yeltsin camp as the president's chief constitutional adviser who  represented the Kremlin in the historic 1992 trial on the legality of the  communist party.
