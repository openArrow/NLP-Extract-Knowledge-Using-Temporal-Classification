South Africa's former government ran up huge  debts of more than 60 billion rand (16.8 billion dollars) in its final year of  power, the Sunday Times newspaper reported.
The money was spent on tidying up the nation's books and settling some  apartheid debts. An economist warned in the report that South Africa's state  debt is approaching danger levels.
Servicing the debt will cost Nelson Mandela's new government 23 billion  rand (6.3 billion dollars) annually and will be the largest item on the next  budget, to be tabled in June, the newspaper said.
Mandela became South Africa's first democratically-elected president  Tuesday after his African National Congress (ANC) swept to victory in the  April 26-29 election.
The former ruling National Party and the Zulu-nationalist Inkatha Freedom  Party were runners-up. The three parties make up the government of national  unity that was announced Wednesday.
The Sunday Times said total state debt is now more than 200 billion rands  (55.5 billion dollars), about 55 percent of gross domestic product, compared  to 155 billion rands (43 billion dollars) in March last year.
"State debt is approaching danger levels," Mike Brown, an economist at  stockbroker Frankel Pollak Vinderine, told the newspaper.
"The real problem is the rate at which the interest burden is rising  relative to economic growth," he said.
The government is faced with a 13 percent rise in the interest bill from  20.5 billion rands (5.6 billion dollars) in 1993-94 to about 23 billion rands  (6 billion dollars), the Sunday Times reported.
