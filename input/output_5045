The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO)  executive has approved the newly-formed Palestinian Authority's programme for  governing the autonomous Gaza Strip and Jericho, a reliable source said  Saturday.
The mini-government will be answerable to the PLO as its political and  juridical reference, the source said.
The programme, put together over the past few days by an ad hoc committee,  was adopted Friday evening by the Palestinian Authority. The document will  govern the operation of the Authority until an autonomy council is elected  before the end of this year.
The program sets out the Authority's political platform, its prerogatives  and its day-to-day operations as well as the mechanisms it will need in order  to function.
The source said PLO executive committee had also ratified the appointment  of 15 of the 20 people named so far to serve on the Authority, including PLO  Chairman Yasser Arafat.
