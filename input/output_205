US-based Hughes Aircraft Co is to be awarded  a contract to supply satellite control equipment for Malaysia's first  telecommunications satellite, company officials said Friday.
Hughes is to seal the deal with Binariang, Sdn Bhd, the telecommunications  company licenced by the government to own and operate the Malaysia East Asia  Satellite (MEASAT), Binariang said.
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad will witness the signing of the deal  Tuesday, Binariang said, declining to provide details yet.
France's Arianespace is keenly vying to launch the 200 million US dollar  MEASAT, targetted for a September 1995 launch from French Guyana.
Malaysia's Telecommunications and Post Minister Samy Vellu Sanglimuthu  recently said Beijing was also vying for the launch contract.
Binariang signed in November 1991 a non-binding memorandum of  understanding with Arianespace and Hughes Communications International Inc  respectively for the launch and manufacture of the satellite.
But latest reports said US-based McDonnell Douglas was also making a  determined effort to get the launch contract.
