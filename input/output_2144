The English footballers' union has called for talks  with the game's governing bodies amid warnings that players' lives are at risk  from hooligan fans.
The alert follows attacks on Derby goalkeeper Martin Taylor and midfielder  Paul Williams during the Rams' promotion play-off match at Millwall's New Den  ground on Wednesday night.
Professional Footballers' Association official Brendan Batson said: "A  player could be killed one day.
"It only needs one complete psycho' intent on making a name for himself."
The PFA plan early talks with the Football Association, Premiership  chiefs and the Football League.
Batson, a former West Bromwich Albion and Arsenal defender, said:  "Reintroducing fences would be a retrograde step but incidents like these are  very distressing."
Garth Crooks, the former Stoke, Tottenham, Manchester United and Charlton  forward, claimed players had been afraid of appearing at Millwall for years.
Crooks said: "I was always concerned about playing there and every black  player I have come across was concerned about playing there.
"It was not only black players, either. If this is what it takes for  people to stop fudging it and intellectually tiptoeing around this subject at  Millwall then so be it."
A month ago Nottingham Forest's black striker Stan Collymore was  confronted by a fan on the pitch during a match at the New Den.
