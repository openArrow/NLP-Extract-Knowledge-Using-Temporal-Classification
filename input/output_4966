RENAMO leader Afonso Dhlakama leaves Maputo for the  United States on Sunday, leaving behind him a failed bid to unite the domestic  opposition around his campaign for the presidency.
Dhlakama, the Mozambique National Resistance leader, is attempting to  promote himself as the single opposition candidate in next October's  elections, when he will be the only serious rival to President Joaquim  Chissano.
During a RENAMO-sponsored meeting of opposition parties Friday, Dhlakama  said: "I don't wish to present myself to the voters as simply a RENAMO  candidate. I want to and will be the candidate for democracy."
But the meeting, which brought together some 14 opposition parties, failed  to produce a vote of collective support for Dhlakama, who waged a 16-year war  against the government before signing a peace accord in October 1992.
During his US visit Dhlakama is scheduled to meet UN secretary-general  Boutros Boutros Ghali on June 3, and the former rebel leader hopes to meet  Vice President Al Gore in Washington, a RENAMO spokesman told AFP.
However, his only confirmed meeting there is with US undersecretary of  state for African affairs, George Moose.
