A burglar alarm screeching for five  days at the home of a vacationing suburban Baltimore man has broken no laws  and cannot be shut off despite complaints from weary neighbors, police said.
"I would like to break in the door and pull that alarm out myself," said  Joan Sheppard, a neighbor who said she has been unable to sleep since Saturday.
But police said the alarm is not in violation of any noise ordinance, and  the local electric company said it has no authority to cut off power to the  home.
"In order to cut off the alarm, you'd have to be inside," said Baltimore  County police spokesman Steve Doarberger. "It would be breaking and entering."
"If the guy has a refrigerator full of food, it would be ruined, or he  could have an aquarium full of fish and the fish could die," Baltimore Gas and  Electric spokeswoman Nancy Caplan said, explaining that power could not be  shut off.
The homeowner was believed to be vacationing in Europe and not due back  home until the weekend.
