Public opinion in Iceland may be swinging in  favour of Iceland joining the European Union, Greek European Affairs Minister  Theodoros Pangalos said here Tuesday.
He was speaking during the first council meeting of the European Economic  Area -- a single market comprising the 12-member EU plus Austria, Finland,  Norway, Sweden, and Iceland which came into existence last January 1.
Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden will all join the EU next January 1 if  membership is approved in national referendums, which would leave Iceland the  EU's sole remaining partner in the EEA.
Until now Reykjavik has opted not to join the EU. But Pangalos quoted  Icelandic Foreign Minister Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson as saying that, according  to recent opinion polls, Iceland no longer wanted to be left out in the cold.
Pangalos, chairman of the EU's council of ministers, added that the EEA,  meanwhile, would be kept functioning after January 1 even if only for Iceland.
"Iceland is a small country, but quality is more important than quality,"  he quipped at a press conference.
The meeting issued a statement saying that the EEA, the world's biggest  single market, had been functioning well since its birth at the beginning of  the year.
It agreed to help Liechtenstein join the association. The duchy could not  sign up last January 1 for technical reasons arising from its close links with  Switzerland. The Swiss rejected EEA membership in a referendum last year.
Finnish Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen acknowledged that the EEA  was "a very important milestone" on the way to EU membership, and should be  kept operating at peak efficiency "until the last possible minute."
