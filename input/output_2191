Two powerful blasts rocked Aden Thursday  evening, spreading panic in the streets of the southern Yemeni stronghold.
The explosions sent residents scurrying to cellars, and a fire broke out  in the area near the airport.
A huge cloud of smoke billowing from the blaze could be seen several  hundred meters (yards) away, from the hotel housing most western journalists  covering the Yemeni civil war.
