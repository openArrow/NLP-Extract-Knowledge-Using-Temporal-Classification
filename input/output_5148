Voters went to the polls Sunday to choose a  successor to President Cesar Gaviria, whose four-year term was marked by  violent struggles with drug lords and leftist guerrillas.
The country was calm as polls opened at 8 a.m. (13H00 GMT) but security  was tight. Leftist rebels have vowed to sabotage the elections and six people  were killed Saturday in three separate attacks.
About 17 million Colombians were eligible to vote in the elections for  president and vice president.
Ernesto Samper, 43, of the Liberal Party, and Andres Pastrana, 39, of the  Conservative Party, were in a tight race at the head of a field of 18  presidential candidates.
