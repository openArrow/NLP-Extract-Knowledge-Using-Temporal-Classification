Hong Kong conglomerate Swire Pacific Ltd. said  Monday it had signed a letter of intent with a northern China beverage firm to  set up a joint venture producing Coca-Cola and Chinese brand softdrinks.
The letter of intent was signed in Beijing at the weekend between BC  Development Co. Ltd., the holding company for Swire Pacific's Coca-Cola  bottling interests in north and central China, and Zhengzhou General Food  Factory, it said in a statement.
The contract for the new joint venture is expected to be finalized by the  end of the year. The new company will be called Swire Zhengzhou BC Foods Co.  Ltd., with BC Development holding a 60 percent stake, the rest held by  Zhengzhou General Food Factory in the northern Chinese city of Zhengzhou.
Total capital investment for the new bottling plant will be 15 million US  dollars and annual production is estimated to be at least 20,000 tonnes of  soft drinks, with the new bottling plant expected to be operational by March  1996.
Beside Swire Pacific, Coca-Cola also has joint venture interests with  Kerry Group of Hong Kong-based Malaysian sugar and property tycoon Robert Kuok  in a line of new bottling plants in China.
There are now 13 Coca-Cola bottling plants in China, with 10 more to come  on line in the next two years, bringing Coca-Cola's total investment in China  to 500 million US dollars.
