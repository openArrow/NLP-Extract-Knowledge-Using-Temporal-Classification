The justice and interior ministers resigned  Friday from the caretaker Dutch government after parliament voted a no  confidence motion over their handling of a long-running police scandal linked  to a drugs "sting" operation.
Interior Minister Ed van Thijn quit hours after the resignation of his  cabinet colleague Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch Ballin, the government press  office said.
Right and left wing deputies had joined Wednesday in passing a motion of  no confidence in both men.
They were accused of failing to ensure the safety of police officers after  their inter-regional unit probing organised crime was disbanded in 1993.
At the time van Thijn was not a minister but, as mayor of Amsterdam, was  in charge of police in the capital.
Ballin was also blamed for the disappearance of 36 tonnes of soft drugs  from a 40-tonne consignment imported as "bait" for underworld figures.
Political observers said the resignations could complicate attempts to  form a new government as van Thijn was a leading figure in the Labour Party  which came top in general elections earlier this month.
And they said Ballin, a Christian Democrat, resigned to avoid embarrassing  outgoing premier Ruud Lubbers, who is bidding to replace Jacques Delors as  European Commission president.
