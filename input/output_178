Japanese bank lending in April grew 0.3 percent from  a year earlier, down from 0.5 percent in March and a record low which  reflected banks writing off non-performing loans, the Bank of Japan said  Friday.
Demand for funds is unlikely to recover in the short term as bigger  companies continue to restrain capital spending, a central bank official said.
Another factor behind the weak demand for loans is the tendency of  companies to bypass their banks and borrow directly from financial markets, he  said.
The official said growth in lending would have been 0.4 percent if the  impact of write-offs and the stronger yen were excluded.
Advances by city banks grew 0.1 percent in April, down from 0.4 percent in  March, while advances by trust banks plunged 2.7 percent, surpassing the  previous a 2.2 percent decline. The drop in lending by long-term credit banks  also eclipsed the March figure, falling 0.4 percent compared with 0.3 percent.
Lending by regional banks rose 1.9 percent, down from two percent in  March, and loans by second-tier regional banks rose 1.6 percent, up from 0.8  percent.
Advances by foreign banks plunged 22.3 percent, exceeding the 18.5 percent  decline recorded in March, the central bank said.
