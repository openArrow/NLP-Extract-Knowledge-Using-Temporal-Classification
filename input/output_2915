Some 1,000 women marched through Taipei's streets  Sunday calling on the authorities to take action against sexual harassment.
The protest, jointly organized by 42 civic groups, was aimed in particular  at the education ministry, which was accused of tolerating sexual harassment  and even rape by university professors of students, organizers said.
Local press reports have alleged that three professors in three prestigous  universities sexually harrassed their female students and one even raped at  least two students.
Organizers also wanted to higlight the problem of sexual harassment in  Taiwan, where society is still very male oriented.
In a statement the organizers called on the government to enact laws to  deal with the problem.
