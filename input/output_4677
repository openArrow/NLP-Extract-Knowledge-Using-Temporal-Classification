A Saudi millionaire businessman has sent veterans of  the Afghan war to fight alongside northern forces in Yemen, the semi-official  Egyptian paper Al-Ahram said Friday.
It said in an editorial that Ossama Ben Ladden, who now lives in Sudan,  had "sent to Yemen via Sudan (Islamic) activists from Pakistan and Afghanistan  to fight alongside the northern forces led by (President) Ali Abdallah Saleh."
Ben Ladden backed the Afghan mujahedeen fighting the Soviet occupation of  Afghanistan in the 1980s.
He is accused by authorities here of financing operations by militant  Moslem groups aiming to topple the Cairo government.
According to Egyptian experts on Islamic movements, Yemen has become a  transit point for former Afghan veterans, after several Arab countries  demanded they be extradited from their bases in Pakistan.
Civil war erupted in Yemen on May 5 after months of tension between rival  northern and southern leaders.
