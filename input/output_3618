But the recurrent theme was his determination to build a "people-centered  society" -- a phrase repeated four times in the opening minutes of his speech  -- of "citizens of the world."
"Let us all get down to work," he concluded to a standing ovation from the  joint session of the two houses, the 90-member Senate that was inaugurated  last week and the 400-member National Assembly elected at last month's  watershed all-race elections.
The two chambers, which together form the Constitutional Assembly that  will give its final shape to the country's constitution during the five-year  tenure of Mandela's national unity government, had their first joint session  Tuesday morning.
The body elected African National Congress secretary-general Cyril  Ramaphosa as its chairman and the National Party's ex-minister of manpower  Leon Wessels as his deputy.
The Assembly session was adjourned after the speech as Mandela,  accompanied by his two deputy presidents, ANC national chairman Thabo Mbeki  and former president Frederik de Klerk, strolled through the picture postcard  parliament gardens, surrounded by a push of photographers.
The National Assembly is scheduled to reconvene Wednesday for a debate to  last until the weekend.
But with no parliamentary opposition to speak of, political analysts  expected it to be a low-key affair as the three government parties --the ANC,  the National Party and the Inkatha Freedom Party -- account for 377 of the  house's 400 members.
