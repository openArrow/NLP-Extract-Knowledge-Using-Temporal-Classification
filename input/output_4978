Israeli troops shot and wounded an axe-wielding  Palestinian on Saturday as he tried to infiltrate a Jewish settlement on the  Gaza Strip, an army spokesman said.
He said the soldiers chased three Palestinians armed with axes who were  caught trying to enter Neve Dekalim. One of them was shot after he threw  stones, another was captured unharmed and the third escaped.
Israeli soldiers on the autonomous Gaza Strip have been redeployed to  protect Jewish settlements.
