US Secretary of State Warren Christopher arrived  in Israel on Monday with a Syrian call for a rapid Israeli withdrawal from the  Golan Heights as part of a peace deal.
Christopher was to meet Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin later the same day.
The secretary flew in from Syria where he met President Hafez al-Assad and  Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shara.
He was to brief Israeli officials on his talks in Syria, where the  official press called for a rapid Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights,  which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
On Tuesday, Christopher is to visit the Palestinian self-rule enclave of  Jericho in the West Bank.
