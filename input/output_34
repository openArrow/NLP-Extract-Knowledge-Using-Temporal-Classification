The US government plans to help send 2,000  buses from around the nation to Atlanta for use at the 1996 Olympics.
The Federal Transit Administration plans to use 16 million dollars in  discretionary funds to help pay to deliver and prepare the buses, which will  be fitted with communications equipment to promote scheduling flexibility.
The buses will be identified by their cities of origin. Transit  authorities in New York, Houston, Birmingham, New Orleans, St. Louis, Orlando,  Philadelphia and the state of New Jersey have pleged buses so far.
Games organizers predict 1.5 million visitors will flood Atlanta each day  of the Olympics. Parts of the city will be closed to private cars and  spectators will use Atlanta city buses and trains and the borrowed buses to  reach events.
