The Canadian economy grew at a faster rate in  March, despite the first increases in interest rates since late 1992, the  government reported Tuesday.
Statistics Canada said the growth in gross domestic product (GDP) rose to  0.5 percent in March, compared to an average of just 0.1 percent in January  and February.
The higher interest rates had a negative effect on the finance, insurance  and real estate sectors, where output slumped 0.8 percent in March.
But this was more than offset by gains in other services sectors, with  overall services output rising 0.3 percent, compared to 0.5 percent in  February.
Goods production advanced 0.8 percent in March, after showing declines in  January and February.
