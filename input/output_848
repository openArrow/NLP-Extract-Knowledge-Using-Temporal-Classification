A bus driver clubbed his step-daughter and two  of his own children to death before killing himself after a family row over a  dowry, police said Monday.
Leeladhar Chauhan's wife, Shakuntala, was also hospitalised with head  injuries after her husband went berserk at their home Sunday following a  quarrel over who should pay for the step-daughter's dowry, the police said.
A police spokesman said the man was enraged by his wife's insistence that  he pay for his step-daughter's wedding trousseau.
Chauhan, 38, picked up a spade and bludgeoned his 18-year-old  step-daughter, Beena, his daughter Kamlesh, 12, and son Vicky, 10, to death.  He also struck a neigbour who came to the family's aid.
Chauhan, an employee of the Delhi Transport Corp., hanged himself with a  skipping rope after the incident.
