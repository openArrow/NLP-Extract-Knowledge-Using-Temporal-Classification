Ireland's rugby tour of Australia took a turn for  worse in a dismal 22-9 loss to the Australian Capital Territory here Wednesday.
Following on from last Sunday's 55-18 drubbing by New South Wales in  Sydney, the Irish were kept try-less while ACT ran in three tries.
Ireland coach Gerry Murphy now faces the daunting task of regrouping his  side leading up to Sunday's encounter with Super Ten champions Queensland and  the first of two internationals against Australia in Brisbane on June 5.
ACT's 13-point margin was flattering to Ireland, with the locals bombing  two tries and fluffing a penalty in front of the posts.
Adding to Ireland's woes were injuries to lock Michael Galway, flanker  Paul Hogan and centre Maurice Field.
Murphy said he had no answer for the lack of urgency which has stifled the  side in its past two games.
"Perhaps it is just that people have not played for some time, I don't  know," he said despondently.
Ireland's points came from three penalty goals by fly-half Alan McGowan.
ACT coach Geoff Stokes warned Ireland would struggle in their remaining  tour matches, particularly against Queensland, unless they toughened up and  worked on some cohesion in their backline.
