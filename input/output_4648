Two Sri Lankan Tamils who served six years in a  British prison for a triple murder were set free Friday by an appeals court  that found police and prosecutors had tinkered with evidence and broken rules.
Supporters of Sam Kulasingham, 37, and Prem Sivalingham, 30, cheered and  applauded as the court quashed the convictions and life sentences given them  in 1988 in the fire-bombing of a house in the east London neighborhood of East  Ham.
The night-time attack in the largely Asian neighborhood was said to be the  culmination of a long-running dispute between rival groups of Tamils, mostly  refugees from the civil war in Sri Lanka.
The appellate judges said they had a "distinct sense of unease" about the  verdicts, and the convictions could not be regarded as safe or satisfactory.
They cited "wholesale breaches" of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act by  police, non-disclosure of evidence which could have helped the defense, and  the possibility a key prosecution witness had fabricated his testimony.
The pair, dubbed the "East Ham Two," saw initial appeals rejected two  years ago, after which Kulasingham went on hunger strike.
After 56 days, when he was close to death, the Home Office appointed a  police board of inquiry to reopen the investigation, leading to the case being  returned to the appeals court.
