Japan, backed by several Caribbean  countries that receive Japanese foreign aid, was expected to oppose a proposed  whale sanctuary at a meeting of the International Whaling Commission that  opened here Monday.
France has proposed that all whale hunting be banned south of the 40th  parallel to protect 11 whale species, including the blue whale and the  humpback.
Japan was expected to fight tooth and nail as it did at last year's  International Whaling Commission meeting in Kyoto.
Tokyo has so far failed, however, in its bid to partially lift an  indefinite ban on the hunting of large whales enacted in 1988. The commission  needs a 75 percent majority to approve a resolution.
The Japanese delegation, under fire from environmentalists who allege that  Tokyo is trading votes for financial aid, is again at the center of attention  here.
Japan argued in 1993 that continued hunting of the minke whale, the last  whale not considered endangered, did not put the species at risk. Japanese  commercial whalers hunt the minke for its meat.
Representatives of about 40 countries are at the four-day meeting at this  Pacific resort.
The president of the commission, Luis Fleischer of Mexico, urged  participants to reach "fair and equitable" agreements to regulate whaling, but  acknowledged that hunting "continues to be relevant to some indigenous  communities and to the culture of some countries."
French delegate Laurent Stefani said he was optimistic that his country's  proposal would be approved this time but Spain's Antonio Fernandez said he  believed it would go down to the wire.
Japan is able to count on support from St. Lucia, Saint Vincent and  Grenada, all of which receive aid from Tokyo, as well as absentions by Norway  and South Korea. Dominica, sources here said, was believed to be reconsidering  its position and supporting the sanctuary.
