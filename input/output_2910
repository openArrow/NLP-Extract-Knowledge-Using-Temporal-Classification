Zhang's film, about three generations of a family living through the  Cultural Revolution, has caused a stir here not least because of the absence  of the director, who has stayed in China to protest censorship of his movie.
Another outsider for the top prize is Canadian Atom Egoyan's "Exotica," a  film of obsession which has divided critics, but attracted strong support from  some.
Late comers which could do well in the race for the Palm include US  filmmaker Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction," premiered Saturday.
'Red' is certainly a strong film, but it is by no means home and dry,"  said one critic.
The Golden Palm is to be announced Monday night at a ceremony here hosted  by French actress Jeanne Moreau. The festival jury, presided by US actor Clint  Eastwood, go into closed session to vote on the issue Monday morning.
Of the other major prizes to be decided Monday, firm predictions are as  hard to come by as those for the top award.
For best actor, widely-tipped is Britain's Albert Finney, for his moving  portrayal of a failed classics master in Mike Figgis' "The Browning Version,"  as has Jean-Louis Trintignant as the judge in "Red."
For best actress two strong contenders are Inna Churikova in "Riaba My  Chicken" and Kristin Scott-Thomas in the Romanian entry of the competition "An  Unforgettable Summer."
Jennifer Jason-Leigh, who starred in both "The Hudsucker Proxy" by Joel  and Ethan Coen and "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle" by Alan Rudolph, has  also been mentioned.
In last year's awards, two films dominated the festival. "The Piano" and  "Farewell to My Concubine" were widely expected to win the Palm virtually from  the start of the festival.
This year the result is far less predictable. As one critic said: "There  are some years when nothing excels; we have seen it before. Last year was an  exception. We await Monday night."
