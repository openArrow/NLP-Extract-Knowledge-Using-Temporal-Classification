The prosecutor's office here began an investigation   Friday into comments made by former Russian vice president Alexander Rutskoi  to determine whether he should be held liable for his recent calls to  overthrow the current regime.
Moscow's prosecutor, Guennady Ponomaryev, was instructed to "begin making  verifications concerning illegal events that occurred May 9," when a gathering  of radical opponents to President Boris Yeltsin was organized, the  prosecutor's office said in a communique carried by Interfax.
The investigation will focus on comments Rutskoi made during the gathering  as well as the burning of a Russian flag by one of the protesters and  anti-semitic statements.
Rutskoi at the time told the gatheriang of some 20,000 people that  Yeltsin's regime must be overthrown and he promised that the current  administration would be replaced within a year.
The Russian penal code includes articles forbidding offensive comments  against the leadership or calls to overthrow the government and anti-semitic  propaganda, a spokesman at the prosecutor's office said.
He added that the prosecutor "would use the full weight of the law to put  an end to these unconstitutional actions."
Rutskoi and various other leaders of the failed October 1993 revolt  against Yeltsin was amnestied by the new legislature in February.
Yeltsin, who opposed the amnesty, warned the revolt leaders at the time  that they would be arrested if they broke the law.
The revolt leaders refused last month to join a civic peace pact called  for by Yeltsin, which forbids political action that could lead to upheaval.
