President Kamuzu Banda will not vote in Malawi's  first multi-party elections Tuesday, a source at the ruling Malawi Congress  Party told AFP.
He said Banda, who is staying at his Sanjika Palace in Blantyre, had  registered  to vote in Zomba, site of his official State House, some 60  kilometres (40 miles) away.
This meant the veteran president would have to either fly or drive to  Zomba to vote and "we cannot do that because we will be accused of  intimidating voters," the source said.
He said the security arrangements required when Banda travelled would not  fit in with the mood of the elections.
International photographers hoping for a picture of Banda voting have been  disappointed.
Key opposition figures, including Bakili Muluzi of the United Democratic  Front, on Monday rushed to their village homes to join voters.
