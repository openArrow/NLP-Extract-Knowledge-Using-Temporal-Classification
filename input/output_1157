Prominent Chinese dissident Wang Dan was released  Tuesday after being held by Beijing police for an hour.
Wang Dan, 24, told AFP by telephone that he had been taken to a police  station at 11:00 a.m. (0300 GMT) and was released an hour later.
The former student leader during 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations was  arrested by 10 policemen during an interview with five journalists from the  American television network NBC at his residence.
"The police asked me how the journalists contacted me and what we had  spoken about," he said, adding that the interview had focused on human rights,  China's most favoured nation trade status with the United States and his  private life.
