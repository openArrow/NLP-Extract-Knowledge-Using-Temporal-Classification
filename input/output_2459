Bosnian Croat "bandits" have  blocked a convoy of about 100 trucks loaded with humanitarian food aid south  of Sarajevo for the last two days, a Bosnian military spokesman said Friday.
Colonel Ekrem Advic said the convoy, with 200 tonnes of food supplies, had  been heading to the hard-hit Tuzla region in northeastern Bosnia.
He said the assailants holding it up near Grude, south of Sarajevo, were  Mafia-like "criminals" and said Croatian President Franjo Tudjman "should get  rid of them."
The Grude region is a stronghold of Croat extremists who back Bosnian  Croat leader Mate Boban.
The spokesman said should the recent accord for a federation between  Croatia and Bosnia be applied, the assailants "would face execution."
He was referring to an agreement reached this month in Washington planning  for a federation to end conflict between Bosnians and Croats, erstwhile allies  in Bosnia against the Serbs. The accord in time calls for a joint army.
