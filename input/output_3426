US and Japanese officials held talks into the  early hours of Tuesday trying to resolve the final hitches in an agreement to  resume stalled trade talks.
A senior US official said before the marathon late-night session that an  agreement was likely, adding "it will probably be announced in the morning"  Tuesday.
In Tokyo, Japan's International Trade and Industry Minister, Eijiro Hata,  said the agreement was "shaping up."
"Now, they are finalising it word by word," he said.
Senior US and Japanese negotiators refused to comment on whether an  agreement had been reached after almost three hours of talks at the US Trade  Representative's office here that ended after 1:00 a.m., but said that they  would make a statement later Tuesday.
"We will have an announcement tomorrow," said Japanese Deputy Foreign  Minsiter for Economic Affairs, Sakayuki Hayashi, as he emerged from the eighth  meeting between the two sides since Thursday.
President Bill Clinton's deputy assistant for economic policy Bowman  Cutter also promised comments later Tuesday, refusing to provide any insight  on the talks.
But one Japanese official said after the meeting that an agreement was  "not finalized," and both sides refused to comment on reports from Tokyo that  they had reached agreement in principle.
The talks here have been punctuated by long breaks, apparently for the  Japanese side to consult with Tokyo on details of the discussions.
The two sides are trying to agree the ground rules for resuming  negotiations on ways to open Japan's markets and reduce its 60 billion dollar  trade surplus with the United States.
The talks collapsed in February in disagreement over ways to measure  progress, with Japan rejecting a US call for numerical targets on the grounds  that it meant managed trade and quotas.
