Irish promoter Barney Eastwood  claimed on Thursday he would take legal proceedings against the World Boxing  Organisation and demanded a rematch between his fighter Ray Close and  Englishman Chris Eubank.
The move follows super-middleweight champion Eubank's controversial  victory over Close here last Saturday, during which the judges' scores varied  wildly and WBO supervisor Alice Richardson then lost the master scoring card.
Eastwood's solicitors say they intend to "institute legal proceedings  against the WBO on the grounds of breach of contract and seeking substantial  damages".
The case appears to hang on the issue of "competent and impartial  officials" supplied by the organisation.
Eastwood added: "My solicitor has also afforded the WBO the opportunity to  mitigate the loss that we have sustained by taking these remedial steps."
"These would include a rematch within three months, with neither fighter   allowed to engage in another contest in the meantime.
"The contest should also be put out to purse offers and a panel of  experienced English judges appointed to supervise the rearranged contest."
After Saturday's fight, Eastwood said of the judges: "These were just hit  men brought over to do a job."
Eubank has already lined up his next defence against Brazilian Mauricio  Amaral on July 9.
But Eastwood is likely to put a restraining order on the WBO champion if a  rematch is not automatically sanctioned by the governing body within seven  days.
