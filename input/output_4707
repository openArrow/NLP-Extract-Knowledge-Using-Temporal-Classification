Peace talks between Somalia's warring factions  will open in the Kenyan capital on Monday, a United Nations spokesman said  Friday.
The negotiations to prepare the ground for a national peace and  reconciliation conference were proposed after Somalia's two chief warlords,  Mohamed Farah Aidid and self-styled interim president Ali Mahdi Mohamed,  signed a UN-brokered reconciliation agreement in Nairobi on March 24.
The talks have been postponed three times during the past two months.
