Nigeria's constitutional conference, scheduled to  start June 27 to debate the future of the country, may be dominated by former  ministers, governors and prominent citizens according to a published list of  those elected on Saturday to attend the gathering.
A total of 273 delegates is expected to emerge from the election. The  government will nominate another 96 other delegates, bringing the total number  to 369.
Among those already listed to have won the election are two former deputy  heads of state, General Shehu Musa Yar'Adua and Alex Ekwueme.
Others include former ministers Emmanuel Nsan, Garba Wushishi, Abubakar  Iro Dan Musa and Jubril Amimu, former state governors David Jang and Shaaba  Lafiagi, former senate majority leader and businessman Olusola Saraki, and  ex-presidential aspirants Yekini Adeojo and Abubakar Atiku.
The National Constitutional Conference Commission, responsible for  preparing an agenda for the four-month conference, has submitted its report to  the federal military government.
The conclusions of the conference are to be presented to the provisional  ruling council for approval, presidential sources said Monday.
Opposition movements, spearheaded by the National Democratic Coalition,  have denounced the conference as a ruse by the military to keep itself in  power and have called for a boycott.
The coalition, which groups retired military officers, politicians,  ex-ministers and governors, has urged General Sani Abacha to relinquish  federal power to Chief Moshood Abiola by May 31.
Abiola is widely believed to have won an election last June 12, the  results of which were later annulled by the military government.
