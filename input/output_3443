Two Northwest Airlines and Cathay Pacific airliners  with more than 600 people onboard nearly collided Sunday near Hokkaido, 900  kilometers (550 miles) north of Tokyo, apparently due to a mistake by air  traffic control, a Japanese official said Tuesday.
Northwest Airlines flight 006, bound for Chicago from Tokyo's Narita  airport, and Cathay Pacific Airways flight 881, bound for Hong Kong from Los  Angeles, flew towards each other at an altitude of 10,500 meters (34,125 feet)  in the same air lane, the transport ministry official said.
Thanks to the two aircraft's anti-collision systems, disaster was narrowly  avoided, the official said.
The Northwest plane had climbed to 10,500 metres (34,125 feet) on  permission from the Tokyo Traffic Control Center, the official said.
The transport ministry said it had no information about the airspeed or  the distance separating the aircraft before anti-collision manoeuvres were  taken.
The Northwest plane carried 248 passengers and the Cathay Pacific flight  354 people.
