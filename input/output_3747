France's National Assembly approved almost  unanimously increases in military spending late Tuesday but government and  opposition remained split on the resumption of nuclear testing.
Only the communists opposed the bill providing for an increase of 0.5  percent in real terms on military equipment up to the year 2000, but the  socialists warned against breaking the two-year-old moratorium on nuclear  testing.
"Resumption of tests would shatter the political capital that has been  built up and would be the signal many would like to see to relaunch the  proliferation" of nuclear weapons, said Jean-Michel Boucheron for the  socialists.
Tests at the South Pacific site of Muroroa atoll were only justified to  develop tactical battlefield nuclear weapons that were "strategically  useless", Boucheron added.
Rene Galy-Dejean said the Rally for the Republic (RPR), conservative  senior partner in the government with the centrist Union for French Democracy  (UDF), welcomed government statements that Muroroa would be maintained in  readiness and that a limited number of tests were needed to perfect a  simulated computer-testing system.
Debate on the bill continues this week and a formal vote will be held May  31.
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said at the opening of the debate that  France reserved the right to resume nuclear testing, despite the moratorium  also being observed by Britain, Russia and the United States.
Socialist President Francois Mitterrand, who under the constitution has  sole power to decide on testing, said recently it would not resume during the  remaining year he has in office.
Mitterrand said his successor, expected to be a conservative, would be  unable to order a resumption because his hands would be tied by the 1995  renewal of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to be followed by a nuclear  test ban treaty.
