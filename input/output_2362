Representatives of more than 18 countries will  meet here next week for three days of preparatory work for the Asian Regional  Forum to be held as part of the annual ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting in  July.
North Korea's nuclear program and the overlapping claims on the Spratly  Islands will be topics of discussion, a foreign ministry official said.
During the preparatory meeting to begin Monday, the representatives of  Japan and South Korea "should express their concern" about the threat of North  Korea's arms acquisition, the official said.
High-level civil servants from the six Association of Southeast Asian  Nations (ASEAN) members, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,  Singapore and Thailand, will meet with seven "dialog partners" -- Australia,  Canada, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and the United  States -- and five observers, China, Laos, Papua New Guinea, Russia and  Vietnam.
The forum is scheduled for July 25 in Bangkok, during the ASEAN foreign  ministers meeting.
Despite the mounting tension on the Korean peninsula, no strong  initiatives are expected. ASEAN, notably Singapore, puts priority on  confidence-building measures between the participants and on avoiding legal  questions.
The forum is scheduled to last three hours, with 10 minutes of speeches  scheduled for each of the 18 representative countries.
In Singapore, Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Friday  that a formal link between a proposed free trade area in ASEAN and the  Australia-New Zealand economic forum was premature.
Anwar, reacting to a suggestion by New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger,  said ASEAN needed to first improve its planned free trade area before seeking  ties with other groups.
"The ASEAN free trade area is still in the offing. It is a very slow  programme, not rendered competitive with the times," he told a news conference  at the end of a two-day visit to the island state.
