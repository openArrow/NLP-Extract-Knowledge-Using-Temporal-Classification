Negotiators at Angola peace talks here began their  second round on national reconciliation Monday by nailing down consensus on  two of the five points they had failed to agree upon over a month ago.
Diplomatic sources monitoring the talks told AFP that rebel UNITA and MPLA  government negotiators have resolved the issue of extending central  administration to areas controlled by UNITA and of what to do with state  property in the hands of the rebel movement.
"They have agreed that all property will be in the hands of government but  this will also highly depend on what posts UNITA will get in government," said  one source.
The sources said details of the agreements will be known after the two  foes, who resumed 16 years of civil war in October 1992 after a 17-month lull,  have exhausted the other three points.
The two sides still have to compromise on the status of UNITA's radio  station Vorgan, the role and position of UNITA deputies in parliament and the  more sensitive point of power-sharing in a government of national unity.
Negotiations on these issues were suspended on March 28 after a failure to  compromise threatened to derail the marathon peace talks, which began in  November last year.
To avoid the complete breakdown of the talks, United Nations mediator  Alioune Blondin Beye resolved that the negotiators begin discussing the next  item on the agenda to keep the progess.
Last week they agreed on how to hold the second round of presidential  elections.
On power sharing, an issue which could still take up a lot of time, the  government has offered UNITA four ministerial and six deputy ministerial  positions, six diplomatic missions, three provincial governorships, (but not  UNITA's stronghold of Huambo), 20 municipal administrators, 35 deputies and 45  communal administrators.
The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) is  demanding more, including Huambo as well as changes in some of the ministries.
