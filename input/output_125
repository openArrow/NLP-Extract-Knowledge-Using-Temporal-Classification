China has named a propaganda expert to head the  country's film, radio and television ministry, an indication that the  communist party wants to strengthen its ideological control, political  analysts said Friday.
Sun Jiazheng, 50, who has made his career with the party in Jiangsu  province, eastern China, replaces Ai Zhisheng, 66, who has been moved to a  minor post with the central committee's propaganda department.
"Naming a relatively young apparatchik, known to be ambitious and tough,  the government is showing its determination to strengthen its media control,"  said a western diplomat.
The government is tightening the screws everywhere because it fears social  unrest might erupt, the diplomat added.
The exceptional praise which Prime Minister Li Peng heaped on Sun in the  People's Daily Friday underlined the importance the party attaches to his  nomination.
Li described Sun Jiazheng as having an excellent "ideological and  political level" as well as great experience.
The governent has taken several steps this year to reduce press,  audiovisual and cultural freedoms in general.
The authorities have decided to limit the number of parabolic antennae  used to capture satellite programmes and also plan to reduce the number of  joint cinema productions with foreign companies.
The government regularly criticises artists who try to produce programmes  independently, particular young film producers.
