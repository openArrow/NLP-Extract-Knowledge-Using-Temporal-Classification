"House of Horrors" wife Rosemary West,  a 40-year-old mother of eight, was Friday charged with murdering her teenaged  daughter, the ninth death in which she is jointly accused with her husband.
Police said Rosemary West was indicted for the murder of Heather West, who  disappeared in 1987 at the age of 16 and whose body was the first of nine  unearthed from the garden, basement and walls of the West home.
Frederick West, a 52-year-old stone mason, is jointly with his wife  charged with those nine murders.
In addition, he is charged with murdering his first wife, Catherine, whose  remains were uncovered in a cornfield at Kempley, 20 kilometers (12 miles)  from here, and their daughter Charmaine, whose body was found buried under  another house in Gloucester where they once lived.
In addition to the nine joint murder counts, Rosemary West faces two  earlier charges of rape, jointly with different men, involving a girl under  the age of 16, and a charge of assaulting an eight-year-old boy.
The gruesome day-by-day uncovery of remains by police excavators has given  the three-storey house at 25 Cromwell Street in this western English city the  name, "House of Horrors."
Rosemary and Frederick West are being held without bail as police continue  to probe sites where they previously lived.
Sources close to the investigation have said the body count in the case  could go as high as 20, which would make the case one of the worse serial  killing in British history.
