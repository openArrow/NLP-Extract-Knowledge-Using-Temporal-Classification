Azerbaijani forces late Tuesday resumed shelling of  Mardakert in northwest Nagorno-Karabakh after peace talks collapsed, Russian  television said, quoting Armenian military sources.
The negotiations in Moscow between the Armenian separatists and Azerbaijan  broke down earlier in the day in a dispute over the enclave's political status.
After the breakdown, Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliyev cancelled a visit  to Georgia that he had planned for Wednesday, Georgian foreign ministry  sources said, quoted by the ITAR-TASS news agency.
The Armenian, Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijani delegations have officially  suspended their talks to allow further consultations with their respective  governments.
A preliminary accord between all sides was signed Monday which brought in  a ceasefire from Tuesday. The truce was largely respected until the reported  shelling Tuesday evening.
This ceasefire was to have been followed by the deployment of observers  from a Russian-led peacekeeping force and a withdrawal of the warring forces  five to ten kilometres (three to six miles) from the front.
A war between Armenian separatists and Azerbaijani government troops in  Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-populated enclave inside Azerbaijan, has left  20,000 people dead in the past six years.
