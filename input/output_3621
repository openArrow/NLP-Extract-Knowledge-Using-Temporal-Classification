England international Matthew Le  Tissier remained a Saint here on Tuesday by signing a new three-year contract  with Premiership side Southampton.
Le Tissier, a key man in the plans of new England boss Terry Venables,  said: "My main ambition as a youngster was to play for England -- now I've  achieved that as a Southampton player I see no need to leave and play  somewhere else to get myself noticed.
"I love it around here and everybody knows it. I could not wish for a  better place to be to play my football," he said.
"I wouldn't have agreed to a new contract if I didn't honestly believe  this club is going places. After last season there's only one way we can go --  and that's up."
Le Tissier scored 25 goals last season to save Southampton from relegation.
