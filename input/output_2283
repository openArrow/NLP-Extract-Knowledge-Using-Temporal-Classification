Cambodia's Khmer Rouge guerrillas Friday dismissed  suggestions they were continuing to receive outside military aid, saying the  tanks they use were captured from Phnom Penh government forces.
In a broadcast monitored in Bangkok, Khmer Rouge radio rejected  allegations earlier this month by Co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh that the  Khmer Rouge were using tanks supplied from abroad.
When guerrilla counter-attacks forced government troops to pull out of  recently-occupied strategic sites, such as Anlong Veng and Pailin, the troops  "abandoned dozens of their tanks on the battlefield," the radio said.
"Khmer Rouge forces captured them like crabs and then used them to attack  government positions," it added.
The radio said Western nations had encouraged Prince Ranariddh to allege  Thailand was helping the Khmer Rouge to justify the government's request for  urgent military aid from abroad.
In an interview in the May 19 issue of the Far Eastern Economic Review,  Prince Ranariddh questioned where the guerrillas had obtained their tanks and  how the tanks had escaped being spotted in Khmer Rouge-controlled areas along  the border with Thailand.
"The Khmer Rouge are using Chinese tanks -- the tanks that (former UN  chief in Cambodia Yasushi) Akashi, with all his helicopters and photographs,  did not manage to discover," Prince Ranariddh said, referring to the UN  peacekeeping mission which ended last year with the country's May elections.
"I want to know, where do these tanks come from?" the prince had remarked.
