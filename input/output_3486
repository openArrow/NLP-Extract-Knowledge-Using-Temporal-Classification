Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino wants Italy  to become part of the United Nation's contact group attempting to restart the  Bosnian peace talks, the daily La Republica reported Tuesday.
Martino, currently in Washington on an official trip, is quoted as saying  that "Italy must take part in the decision-making process" concerning Bosnia,  where it has "important geographical and military interests."
"Italy's exclusion from the contact group is unacceptable," he said,  adding that he wants Italy to become more involved in various international  organizations.
He said he would be willing to send peacekeeping troops to Bosnia on  condition that Italy be involved in the decision-making process and that the  troops be sent there as part of a peacekeeping mission agreed to by all of  Bosnia's warring parties.
The newspaper added that while in Washington, Martino planned to press for  a   permanent seat for Italy on the UN Security Council.
The council currently has five permanent members -- the United States,  Britain, China, France and Russia.
