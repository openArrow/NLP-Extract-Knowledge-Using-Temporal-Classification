Beijing moved quickly Wednesday to rule out any  possibility of South Africa's extending dual recognition to China and Taiwan.
"We are against any form of dual recognition," a Chinese foreign ministry  spokesman said.
In a major policy switch, Taiwan said Tuesday that it would not seek to  cut official ties with South Africa if Pretoria switched diplomatic  recognition to Beijing.
The announcement by Foreign Minister Frederick Chan marked the first time  Taiwan had indicated it would be prepared to tolerate dual recognition with  China.
However, the Chinese spokesman was adamant such an arrangement would be  unacceptable to Beijing. "We firmly oppose any attempt aimed at creating two  Chinas, or one China one Taiwan," he said.
China refuses to permit countries with which it has diplomatic relations  to recognise Taiwan, which it has regarded as a renegade province ever since  Nationalist forces fled to the island in 1949 after losing a civil war to the  communists on the mainland.
Similarly, Taipei has previously broken ties with any country which  switches formal recognition to Beijing.
Beijing and South Africa's new government of national unity are widely  expected to establish diplomatic relations later this year.
China, a long-time supporter of the black majority's struggle for  political rights in South Africa, had refused to establish ties with the white  government in Pretoria until the country's apartheid system was completely  dismantled.
"We believe that relations between China and the new South Africa will  enjoy all-round development in the future," the spokesman said.
In October last year, China resumed economic and trade links with South  Africa which had been suspended in 1960.
Taiwan currently maintains official ties with only 29 countries, including  South Africa, but has in recent years launched a diplomatic offensive --  especially in Southeast Asia -- to cement ties with other governments.
