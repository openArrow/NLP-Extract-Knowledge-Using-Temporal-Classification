After Ballesteros's resignation the decision was left in entirely British  hands: captain Bernard Gallacher, Neil Coles, the chairman of the European  Tour's Board of Directors, and Professional Golfers' Association board members  Phil Weaver (chairman), David Huish (vice-chairman) and Brian Anderson.
Valderrama's bid contained plans for a daily crowd figure of 26,000, made  up of 10,000 tickets for sale locally to residents and homeowners on the Costa  del Sol, 10,000 for the rest of Spain and abroad, 4,000 for hospitality tents,  1,000 for Valderrama members and guests, and the remaining 1,000 for official  bodies.
Parking for 12,000 cars will be on land held back from development  especially for the Ryder Cup, while with no hotel on site the players will  stay at the nearby San Roque club. Underground pipes have already been laid  for television cables.
Meanwhile Welsh star Ian Woosnam has given his support to a new course at  Newport, South Wales, which has ambitions to host the Ryder Cup.
Woosnam said of the Celtic Manor Hotel course, part of a 50 million pound  complex due to open in June 1995: "By the year 2001 it will be ready for a  Ryder Cup bid."
