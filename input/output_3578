Palestinian self-rule will cost Israeli  taxpayers 50 million dollars per year, the budget director at the finance  ministry said Tuesday.
David Brodet explained that government compensation to Israeli farmers  would account for most of the cost, as the economic track of the self-rule  agreement allows the Palestinians to sell their produce at cheaper prices in  Israel.
An economic agreement signed in late April in Paris however set quotas on  Palestinian sales of five products, including tomatoes, cucumbers and eggs,  during the five years of self-rule before a final settlement.
Self-rule was launched earlier this month in the Gaza Strip and West Bank  town of Jericho.
Finance Minister Avraham Shohat told parliament on Monday that the  agreement was "good for the Palestinians and also good for Israel, as it  provides an opening to Middle East markets."
