Former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher is  to accept an invitation to give evidence to MPs investigating aid to  Malaysia's controversial Pergau dam project, the Financial Times reported  Thursday.
Staff at Thatcher's office said she would announce her acceptance of the  invitation from the foreign affairs committee later this week.
As a member of the House of Lords, Thatcher, now a baroness, is not bound  to appear before the committee.
However, MPs believe she can throw light on attempts to link an offer of  234 million pounds (351 million dollars) in aid and Malaysia's decision to buy  more than one billion (1.5 million dollars) worth of defence equipment from  Britain.
Such a link is contrary to government guidelines on aid and trade.
British Prime Minister John Major has said Thatcher had dicussed aid and  defence sales with the Malaysian prime minsiter Mahathir Mohamed on a trip to  Kuala Lumpur in 1988.
The British government has acknowledged that it initially gave the  Malaysians to understand that there could be a link between the Pergau Dam aid  and the sale of one billion pounds worth of British warplanes to Malaysia, but  said it quickly rectified that impression.
Malaysia banned British firms from new government contracts on February  25, following allegations in the British media of corruption in Anglo-Malaysia  trade and in Mahathir's administration.
The Sunday Times was singled out for a February 20 article alleging links  between Mahathir and the British construction giant Wimpey International.
