Talks between the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) and North Korea over the removal of fuel rods at a  nuclear site have failed, deepening the nuclear crisis, diplomatic sources  said Friday.
North Korea is continuing the remove then used rods, added the sources.
IAEA director general Hans Blix is likely to provide a report on the  problem to the UN Security Council later Friday or early Saturday at the  latest, they added.
In Washington a senior administration official said "we understand the  talks did not produce any agreement." The official said he understood there  were no plans to resume the talks.
The IAEA says it must be able to set its own conditions to monitor the  discharge of spent fuel rods from the five-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon in  order to ascertain whether any plutonium has been diverted.
North Korea has blocked full international inspections of its nuclear  facilities for more than a year, sparking fears that it is developing nuclear  weapons.
