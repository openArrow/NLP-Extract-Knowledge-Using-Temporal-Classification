Brazil's Varig airline soon will eliminate 2,650  jobs in an effort to steer clear of bankruptcy, its chairman said Tuesday.
Varig, one of the biggest Latin American airlines, owes creditors 1.9  billion dollars.
Rubel Thomaz, head of the 50-year-old carrier, made his announcement after  meeting with Brazilian Labor Minister Marcelo Pimentel, who was mediating on  behalf of airline employees.
Thomaz said the drastic measure was irreversible if the company was to  stay afloat.
