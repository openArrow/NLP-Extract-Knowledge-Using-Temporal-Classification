Britain's seasonally-adjusted visible trade deficit  with countries outside the European Union narrowed to 566 million pounds (849  million dollars) in April from a revised 686 million pounds in March, the  central statistical office (CSO) said on Monday.
The reduction flowed from a decrease in the ratio of imports to exports,  and the resulting deficit was less than analysts' expectations of between 650  million to 700 million pounds.
The deficit in April, excluding oil, was 621 million pounds, down from the  revised 685 million pound deficit in March, originally reported as 673 million  pounds.
Excluding oil and erratics, the deficit narrowed to 686 million pounds in  April from a revised 690 million pounds in March, orginally reported as 702  million pounds.
Visible trade is defined as goods that are actually shipped and sold, as  opposed to invisible trade, which is defined as payments for services such as  insurance, shipping, banking and dividends.
Erratics are defined as ships, North Sea oil installations, aircraft,  precious stones and silver.
The visible deficit for the three months February to April was 1.909  billion pounds, compared with 2.162 billion pounds in the three months to  January.
Exports totalled 15.485 billion pounds in the latest three months,  compared with 14.975 billion pounds in the previous quarter. Imports totalled  17.395 billion pounds in the latest three months, compared with 17.137 billion  in the previous quarter.
The visible trade deficit in the latest three months, excluding oil and  erratic items, was 2.066 billion pounds compared with 1.735 billion pounds in  the previous quarter.
At the beginning of the month, the CSO announced a total trade deficit of  731 billion pounds for February against a January figure of 880 billion pounds.
There was a delay in the publication of full United Kingdom statistics for  trade for the CSO to assess the reliability of a new method of registering  intra-EC trade following the abolition on January 1 1993 of European border  controls on goods, services and capital.
Border customs returns were used to measure trade before January 1, 1993.  The new system will be based on returns for VAT valued-added sales tax.
