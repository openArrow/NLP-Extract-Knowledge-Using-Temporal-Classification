Iran does not plan to improve ties with Egypt  despite a visit planned by Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati to Cairo next  week, a ministry spokesman said Tuesday.
Iran and Egypt broke diplomatic ties after the 1979 Islamic revolution and  maintain diplomatic contact at interest section level.
The spokesman, quoted on Tuesday by the radical daily Jomhuri Islami, said  Velayati would only go to Cairo to take part in a meeting of the Non-Aligned  Movement (NAM), and the visit "has nothing to do with bilateral ties."
"Given the nature of the Egyptian government, Iran has no intention of  boosting ties beyond the interest section level," he said, adding that  Velayati "would not meet any Egyptian officials" during his visit.
It will be the first to Egypt by a senior Iranian official since the  revolution.
The English-language Tehran Times said last week that Velayati, whose  visit is to start on May 30, could meet his Egyptian counterpart Amr Mussa,  but they "would not discuss improving bilateral relations."
Since the revolution Iran has been represented at international  conferences in Cairo by low-ranking officials.
The two governments have on several occasions expressed a desire to  normalise ties, but no breakthrough has yet been made due to the opposition  from Islamic hardliners in Iran.
The news of a meeting last September between Velayati and Mussa on the  sidelines of the UN General Assembly triggered criticism from radicals.
Issues which have affected relations between Cairo and Tehran included  Egypt's peace treaty with Israel, and Egypt's accusation that Iran aids its  fundamentalist militants, which Tehran denies.
