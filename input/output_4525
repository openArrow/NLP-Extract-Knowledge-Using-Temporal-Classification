The ruble fell to 1,904 to the US dollar Friday,  down from 1,901 to the greenback during Thursday's trading on the Moscow  Interbank Currency Exchange.
Volume of trade totalled 46.25 million dollars with initial demand of  46.25 million dollars and initial offers of 43.45 million dollars.
The ruble crossed the 1,900-threshold this week despite a series of  economic decrees issued by President Boris Yeltsin aimed at stopping a  dramatic fall in industrial output.
Yeltsin scrapped export quotas and licenses and threatened to place  mismanaged entreprises under strict state control.
