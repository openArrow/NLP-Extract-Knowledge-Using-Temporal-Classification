A bomb exploded Monday in an unoccupied office of  the Belfast City Hall, injuring at least two persons, one of them seriously,  police said.
The injured were restoring the building.
Police said the office in which the bomb exploded was one regularly used  by Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), raising  suspicions it had been planted by Protestant extremists. There was no  immediate claim.
The blast came about 30 minutes after a shopping mall security guard was  shot in the head and critically wounded by two gunmen in an attack claimed by  the IRA.
