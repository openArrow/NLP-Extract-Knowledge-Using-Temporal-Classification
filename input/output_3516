Suzuki Motor Co. Ltd. and Hino Motors Co. Ltd., the  biggest Japanese manufacturers of minicars and trucks, forecast mixed  performances for the current year following double-digit declines in earnings,  in statements on Tuesday.
Suzuki, the leading minicar maker and the world's third-largest  manufacturer of motorcycles, said that its pre-tax earnings had fallen by 10.2  percent from the figure a year earlier to 18.4 billion yen (179 million  dollars) in the year to March.
The company said sales declined by 4.2 percent otors Corp. of  the United States, forecast even lower earnings of 18 billion yen for the  current year with sales falling to 1,000 billion yen.
Hino, the truckmaking affiliate of Japan's biggest carmaker Toyota Motor  Corp., said its pre-tax profit plunged by 33.4 percent to four billion yen.
Sales fell by 15.3 percent to 535 billion yen in the same period,  depressed by lower revenue in most areas except for exports of small and  medium-sized trucks and parts for overseas production.
But Hino forecast a slightly higher profit of 4.5 billion yen in the  current year with sales edging up to 540 billion yen.
Suzuki said revenue from car sales dropped by 3.9 percent to 711 billion  yen in the latest year while motorcycle revenues dived by 7.3 percent to 168  billion yen. Revenue from marine and power products fell by 1.2 percent to 42  billion yen and revenue from car parts was down by 1.8 percent at 88 billion  yen.
In terms of volume, car sales were mainly depressed by a slump in exports.  Domestic sales were stagnant with a modest increase in minicar sales  offsetting lower sales of small cars. Motorcycle sales were depressed by a  sharp decline in domestic sales which outweighed increases in exports.
Suzuki said its total car sales declined by 7.4 percent to 750,468 units  with exports plunging by 22.3 percent to 221,230 units. Domestic sales edged  up 0.7 percent to 529,238 units with minicar sales rising 0.8 percent to  472,337 units and sales of small cars dropping 0.2 percent to 56,901 units.
Motorcycles sales dropped by 3.4 percent to 603,562 units. Exports rose by  six percent to 444,682 units but domestic sales were down by 23.2 percent to  158,880 units, the company said.
