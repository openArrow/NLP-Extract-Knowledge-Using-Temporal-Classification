The US side has said it will not abandon its call for numerical targets to  measure progress in market opening, while Tokyo has rejected such targets,  saying they mean managed trade.
But reports in Tokyo on Wednesday said that Japan appeared ready to accept  specific targets in the field of government procurement to revive the stalled  trade talks.
On Thursday the Japanese side is expected to propose setting some criteria  to gauge Japanese government procurement of various products, the Nihon Keizai  Shimbun newspaper said.
Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa hinted at a compromise earlier this week,  saying Japan "might show some numerical gauges over government procurement."
And a Japanese international trade and industry ministry official said "it  is possible that we will have to make drastic decisions to realize an increase  in our procurements from overseas."
After Kantor meets briefly with Hayashi, the Japanese negotiator and his  colleague Sozabaru Okamatsu, vice minister at the international trade and  industry ministry, will meet with members of the USTR negotiating team.
Also present will be Bowman Cutter, a member of the White House economic  policy team.
USTR officials stressed Thursday that the session was talks about talks to  discuss the basis for a return to the negotiating table, but said it could  result in the announcement of a date to resume full-fledged negotiations.
The two sides are trying to agree on the definition of "objective  criteria" to measure progress in opening Japan's markets in the key areas of  government procurement, the auto trade, and financial services under a  framework agreement reached in July last year.
The government procurement talks cover computers, supercomputers,  satellites, medical technology and telecommunications.
