No one expects the United States to win the 1994  World Cup, but the pressure is on the inexperienced host team to make it to  the second round at least.
International football officials are looking for a creditable performance  from the United States to justify their decision to give the World Cup to  America.
And American football officials are counting on the side to capture the  interest of US fans, whose support for the new Major League Soccer  professional league is still in doubt.
To get to the second phase, the United States will have to win a World Cup  match for the first time since the 1950 finals.
"I think we can legitimately get through the first round, and I think  that's what we have to look for," says US Soccer Federation secretary general  Hank Steinbrecher.
"I think we ought to be beyond the first round, and I'm going to be  disappointed if we don't."
The side's task was made more difficult, but not impossible, when they  were drawn in Group A with Switzerland, Colombia and Romania.
The man in charge of producing the US miracle is Bora Milutinovic, who  guided Costa Rica to the 1990 World Cup finals.
"He has the reputation of a miracle worker," World Cup chief Alan  Rothenberg says. "He had Mexico to the quarter-final round and Costa Rica  through to the second stage of the tournament in 1990.
"Given the incredibly tough draw the United States got, he'll have his  hands full duplicating either of those accomplishments, but I tend to believe  he will."
Since taking over in March 1991, Milutinovic has used a stream of  competitive and friendly matches to whip his squad into shape.
Their final World Cup tune-up will be against Mexico on June 4 at the Rose  Bowl in Pasadena, California, venue for the final.
In mid-May Milutinovic began integrating his European-based players into  the squad. He has been cagy about his final 22-man roster, and will likely  remain so until the June 3 deadline.
