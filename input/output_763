Three Germans fell to their deaths in the Italian  Alps while attempting to scale the Gran Zebru glacier Sunday, rescue services  said.
Manfred Lupp, 47, his wife Regina Alberta Hack, 48, and Karl Petri, 52,  were climbing one of the glacier's faces when they were swept away by a mass  of snow and ice. The three plunged some 800 metres to their deaths.
Two other climbers survived the incident, near the border with Austria.
