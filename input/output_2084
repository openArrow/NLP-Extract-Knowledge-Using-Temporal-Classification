Businessman Bakili Muzuli emerged Thursday as  Malawi's new elected leader after defeating Kamuzu Banda who had once called  himself President-for-life during his 30 years of autocratic rule.
Muluzi, 51, vowed to champion the rule of law, alleviate poverty and boost  social services and promised there would be no witch-hunt against Banda, who  bowed out graciously on Thursday morning, admitting defeat.
"We will not work on retribution," Muluzi told journalists at his first  press conference after the election, the first free poll after Banda guided  the country to independence from Britain in 1964 and made it a single-party  republic two years later.
"He made mistakes here and there, but we will look after him," Muluzi said  of Banda, who is believed to be in his 90s. "He is an old man and nobody would  want to push him around."
News of Muluzi's victory brought hundreds of chanting and car-hooting   supporters of his United Democratic Front (UDF) out on to the streets of  Blantyre, the economic capital of the small, poor southern African nation.
"This is the real freedom we have been waiting for," one labourer,  Kondwani Phiri, said as he downed his tools and rushed to the UDF headquarters  here. "We have finally shown Banda the exit door."
Muluzi said his new government would champion the rule of law and create a  new culture of openess and transparency following the years under Banda, who  had reigned like an absolute monarch shielded by a coterie of advisors.
The government's priorities would be to alleviate poverty, offer social  services and improve education, he added.
There was a serious land shortage in the tiny south-east African state, he  said, adding: "We don't know how we will solve that, but we'll not go around  snatching land."
Muluzi said he was concerned that the election results already available,  with more than two thirds of the votes counted, had shown regional and tribal  divisions.
