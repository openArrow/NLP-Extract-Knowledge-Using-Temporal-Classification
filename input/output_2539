US-Japan talks aimed at breaking a three-month  deadlock in trade negotiations are going well and will be extended into a  third day, a senior US official said Friday.
"The conversations are going well," President Bill Clinton's deputy  economic advisor Bowman Cutter said as he emerged from an almost three-hour  session, the third since Thursday morning.
"We'll meet again tomorrow in the morning," he said, adding that the two  sides were unlikely to meet again Friday.
The talks had originally been scheduled to last only one day, and the few  comments made by officials since Thursday morning have generally been hopeful.
Both sides have kept comments to a minimum, but US Trade Representative  Mickey Kantor said Thursday that the talks had started well, and the extension  into a second and then a third day suggested that the two sides were involved  in serious detailed discussion.
The two sides are trying to reach agreement on the ground rules for  resuming negotiations on ways to open Japan's markets and reduce its 60  billion dollar trade surplus with the United States under a July accord.
Talks broke down in February in disagreement on how to measure progress,  with Japan rejecting a US demand for numerical targets as leading to managed  trade and quotas.
Washington has consistently said it would not return to the negotiating  table unless Japan came up with new proposals that would give the talks a good  chance of success.
This week's talks were at Japan's request, and reports out Tokyo before  they began suggested the Japanese side might be bringing proposals for a  limited acceptance of such targets in the area of government procurement.
The principal players have refused to say whether the Japanese did bring  such an offer, but one US trade official said that the Japanese side had  brought detailed proposals which the US side considered worth exploring.
