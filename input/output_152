Palestinians broke into  the Khan Yunes post office and stole everything they could carry just hours  after the Israelis handed over the town to the Palestinian police, witnesses  said.
Dozens of youths smashed down the doors and made off with telephones, fax  machines, desks and chairs.
It was not immediately known if money was taken.
The dawn raid came after Israeli security forces handed over the army,  administration and police buildings to 30 Palestinian police officers and  pulled out of the town.
All post offices in the occupied territories, which have been run by the  Israeli authorities, are due to be transferred to the Palestinians under  autonomy.
PLO officials said some 300 other policemen who are due to be stationed in  Khan Yunes have been held up by the Israelis since Thursday at the border  crossing from Egypt.
More than 600 Palestinian police have entered Gaza this week and been  given charge of the south of the strip, but they are not yet operational.
