A faction from Ali Salem al-Baid's Yemeni Socialist  Party pledged their support for the country's unity Saturday, denouncing the  southern strongman as a "traitor" for declaring an Aden-based independent  state, Sanaa radio said.
In a report monitored by the BBC, the committee of the party's Fatah  faction sent a telegramme to president Ali Abdallah Saleh expressing support  for the country's unity and urging him to make a determined stand against  moves to divide the country.
The faction "stated its rejection of the secessionist step taken by the  traitor Ali Salem Al-Baid and his secessionist gang, and called for purging  the country of this rotten band," the radio said.
Baid declared an independent Yemeni Democratic Republic in the south  overnight Friday after 17 days of bitter civil war between the north and south.
The telegramme, sent on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of Yemen's  unification, said the independence declaration was at loggerheads with YSP  grassroots opinion, the radio said.
In another dispatch also monitored by the BBC, Aden radio said southern  authorities had dismissed claims by Saleh that his forces had destroyed 80 per  cent of the south's military equipment and that three southern brigades had  surrendered in the oil-rich eastern Shabwa region.
Aden radio quoted a southern military source as accusing Saleh of lying to  conceal northern defeats.
Earlier in the day southern commanders said northern troops had moved east  into Shabwa to attack forces loyal to Baid.
Heavy artillery bombardment was clearly heard Saturday from Aden.  Correspondents said northern troops turned up the heat and pushed back their  opponents to within 40 kilometres (25 miles) of the city.
