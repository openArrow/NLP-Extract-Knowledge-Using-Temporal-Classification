Russia intends to sign NATO's partnership for  peace (PFP) programme of military cooperation with countries of the former  Soviet bloc, Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said here Tuesday.
Speaking after a meeting with NATO defence ministers, he said Russia would  sign the programme "without setting forth any conditions."
This contradicted a remark Grachev made on his arrival here earlier in the  day -- that Russia wanted the partnership accord accompanied by a separate  agreement with NATO on bilateral political relations.
He told journalists after the meeting that the partnership's framework  agreement "does not fully set forth the principles and themes of cooperation  (as sought by Russia.)"
The framework accord lays out the basis of military cooperation but it  does not detail the specific levels of activity which each country of the  partnership will contribute to the programme.
The Russian general said he would set forth the details of Russia's  proposed participation here Wednesday during a meeting between NATO and its  eastern bloc partners in the North Atlantic Cooperation Council.
Reacting to persistent reports that Russia might not sign the partnership  accord unless it gets a parallel political accord with NATO, Grachev said:  "President (Boris) Yeltsin has made it clear that Russia will join the PFP."
He gave no date for the signing. But the general added that the Russian  military was "ready and willing" to cooperate in the partnership with the  military structures of NATO and the former eastern bloc members of PFP.
