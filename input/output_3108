A local subsidiary of the Royal Dutch Shell Group  has flowed gas at a rate of 24.8 million cubic feet (744,000 cubic metres) and  condensate at 953 barrels per day (bpd) at an offshore well in southwestern  Philippines, the energy department said here Monday.
The gas find in the Malampaya-3 well, northest of Palawan island came two  weeks after the same firm, Shell Philippines Exploration, also struck oil at  5,487 bpd at the same site during its first drill stem test.
An industry source said the gas and condensate flows during the second and  final drill stem test were "significant" because they confirmed the  Malampaya-3 well contains both oil and gas. Condensate can be purified to get  oil.
The source said the next step for Shell is to wrap up operations at  Malampaya-3 and drill a fourth well before it decides on commercial production.
Shell has also flowed oil at its first and second wells in the Malampaya  complex, which is touted to be a potential major oil field.
Most of the country's wells are concentrated off Palawan island, but  drillers are beginning to explore frontier areas such as the Sulu Sea in the  southwest and potential sites in the central Philippines.
About 20 wells are scheduled to be drilled this year.
The Philippines' only commercially producing wells are found in the West  Linapacan field near Malampaya, but water seepage has reduced output to 3,500  bpd from 15,000 bpd last year.
Alcorn (Production) Philippines Inc., a subsidiary of US firm Vaalco  Energy Inc. and lead operator in West Linapacan, last week successfully flowed  oil at a sidetrack well at a rate of 2,603 bpd in a bid to boost output.
Oil exploration is attracting foreign interests here because of the vast  amount of resources and technology needed in these mostly offshore areas.
