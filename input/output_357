Washington is hoping Indian Prime Minister P.V.  Narasimha Rao's US tour beginning Saturday will bring better understanding  between the two sides on the thorny nuclear issue, but is not expecting any  breakthrough announcements.
"It is an opportunity to review issues of concern and a chance for Rao and  Clinton to get to know each other better," a senior US official said.
Rao's trip, the first by an Indian Prime Minister to the United States  since Rajiv Gandhi visited in 1987, comes at a time of disagreement between  the two sides on a number of issues, notably India's ambitious nuclear and  missile programmes, Kashmir, human rights and trade.
Washington is urging both India and Pakistan to put a cap on their nuclear  programs in the interests of non-proliferation in the region.
But Rao is under tremendous domestic pressure to resist US calls to cap  the nuclear program and freeze its missile defence programme, and the  Washington trip is his most controversial foreign visit in three years in  office.
For the US side, "non-proliferation remains the goal" in both India and  Pakistan, and "we are moving along on a broad front, in a lot of different  areas," to try and achieve that, the US official said.
The carrot for Pakistan is the possibility of obtaining delivery of F-16  fighter planes it has already paid for but which were frozen by Congress.
With India there is not such obvious quid pro quo, but there are areas in  which the United States could offer more help, such as science and technology  transfers, US officials say.
In any case, "the bottom line in all this is that you can't buy agreement  either from Pakistan or India on nuclear proliferation issues if they are not  persuaded that this is in their own best security interests," one said.
There has also been friction over Kashmir, with India feeling that the  administration of US President Bill Clinton favors Pakistan in the dispute and  has tacitly encouraged the Moslem insurgency in Kashmir.
