US and Japanese negotiators will meet here  Thursday to discuss the trade dispute which has soured relations between the  world's two largest economic powers, a White House official said Monday.
Earlier talks broke down in February when then Japanese prime minister  Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton failed to see eye-to-eye at a  White House summit meeting.
The White House official, who asked not to be named, said that it was not  known who would represent the Japanese side at the talks and gave no further  details on their content.
US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said Friday that he had reached  agreement with Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa on the need for  preliminary contacts aimed at reviving bilateral trade talks.
The so-called framework agreement negotiations collapsed in February  because of a dispute over how to measure progress in opening Japan's market  and reducing its 60-billion-dollar trade surplus with the United States.
In Tokyo, officials said Kakizawa had agreed to resume the stalled  framework talks, but Kantor's statement Friday after a 30-minute telephone  conversation with Kakizawa spoke only of preliminary contacts.
Both men "shared the hope that a basis will emerge for the resumption of  the framework talks before the July G7 meeting in Naples," a statement from  Kantor's office said.
Earlier Friday, Japanese Trade Minister Eijiro Hata said that two  high-ranking officials -- Sozaburo Okamatsu and Sadayuki Hayashi -- were  likely to go to Washington for talks aimed at breaking the deadlock. But there  was no confirmation from the US side.
The framework agreement between the two countries targets four key sectors  as crucial to slashing the Japanese trade surplus. They are automobiles,  insurance, telecommunications and medical equipment.
The February talks broke down over Japan's refusal to accept the principle  of set numerical targets to track how much Tokyo was doing to open up its  domestic markets.
