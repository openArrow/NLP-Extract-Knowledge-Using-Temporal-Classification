It was the goal of the tournament and Baggio's role in the national side  has not been an issue since.
Michel Platini, the legendary France midfielder whose number 10 shirt at  Juventus has at last found a worthy wearer, summed up Baggio.
"He combines the best in a classic centre forward, a number nine, with the  passing and creative work of a playmaker, the number ten. I think we should  call him a nine and a half."
It's an assesment Baggio likes. "What Platini said suits me fine," he  says. "I'm not a real out and out striker or a classic midfielder."
His contribution to club and country is little short of phenomenal.
It all adds up to a heavy burden: when Italy line up against Ireland in  Giants Stadium on June 18, a whole nation will sit back and wait for Baggio to  perform.
Fortunately for Italy, there is no evidence to suggest Baggio does  anything other than thrive on pressure.
At every crucial turning point in the qualifying campaign, during which  Italy were often in severe danger of failing to get to the United States, it  was Baggio who popped up to make the difference.
In what turned out to be the decisive game of the group, Baggio scored one   and made two as Italy beat Portugal 3-1 in Porto.
When Juventus lifted the UEFA Cup last year, the rest of the team hoisted  him on to their shoulders in recognition of what was virtually a one-man show.  In four semi-final and final matches Baggio had scored five goals.
