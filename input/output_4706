Ethiopia is seeking the extradition of former  dictator, Mengistu Haile Mariam, in exile in Zimbabwe, through legal means  rather political, the country's ambassador here said Friday.
Fantahun Michael told a news conference Friday to commemorate the founding  of peace and democracy in Ethiopia, that a prosecuting office in his country  was given a mandate by the government to bring charges against Zimbabwe,  without any political interference.
Fantahun said his government had made several requests to Zimbabwe to have  Mengistu handed over to be tried for crimes committed during his 17-year rule,  but without response.
The latest request to extradite Mengistu was handed to Zimbabwe in  February by a team of European lawyers helping the government of Meles Zenawi  investigate Mengistu's human rights violations.
Fantahun, who lead the team of lawyers to Zimbabwean foreign minister,  Nathan Shamuyarira, said the minister had promised to take the request to  cabinet and a response could be expected at a later date.
Mengistu has been in Zimbabwe since May 1991 when he fled his country as  his civil war foes were poised to take the capital Addis Ababa.
President Robert Mugabe, his longtime ally, granted him political asylum  on "humanitarian" grounds. He lives in a tightly-guarded luxurious house in  Harare.
Fantahun said Ethiopian had no hard feelings against Zimbabwe over for  hosting Mengistu as many other African states housed fleeing leaders.
