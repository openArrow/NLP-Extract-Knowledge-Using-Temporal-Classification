The foreign ministers of Russia, the United States  and five western European countries ended a meeting on Bosnia-Hercegovina  Friday with a call for a ceasefire, and negotiations between the warring  parties in two weeks, a French diplomatic source reported.
He said the ministers had called for the ceasefire to be "unconditional."
A communique due to be published later in the evening would express the  ministers' support for a European Union proposal to divide the former Yugoslav  republic on the basis of 51 percent for a federation of Moslems and Croats,  and 49 percent for Serbs, the source said.
The ministers from the United States, Russia, Germany, Britain, France,  Belgium and Greece also proposed a phased suspension of UN sanctions against  the rump Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) if a peace agreement was reached  and accompanied by a withdrawal of forces to agreed lines, the source added.
