Ten countries are expected to back the sanctuary: Argentina, Australia,  Britain, Denmark, France, Ireland, Mexico, Monaco, the United States and New  Zealand. Dominica may also back the plan.
Japan can count on support from Grenada, St. Vincent and St. Lucia. Norway  and South Korea are expected to abstain.
Chile opposes the creation of a sanctuary which would include any of its  territorial waters, though President Eduardo Frei opposes commercial whaling.  In Santiago Tuesday, protestors at a Greenpeace-sponsored march voiced support  for the sanctuary.
Cliff Curtis, Greenpeace's international whale protection campaign  coordinator, said that most countries were expected to vote on establishing  the smaller sanctuary.
The rich southern waters have yielded 1.5 million of the huge mammals in  the past century, hunted for their meat, blubber and whalebone.
Among others, the sanctuary is designed to protect the 1,000 remaining  blue whales, which grow to 30 meters (100 feet) and can weigh 150 tonnes.  There are believed to be about 12,000 humpbacked whales.
The no-hunting zone would also benefit the minke whale, which has replaced  the blue and humpbacked as a target of Japanese and Norwegian whalers.
Japan insists that hunting of the minke whale does not endanger the  species, and is a traditional dish in Japan "the way turkey is eaten in the  United States," Japanese delegate Tahiko Nakamura said.
In addition to commercial hunting, the whale is threatened by climatic  changes such as the destruction of the ozone layer protecting Earth from the  sun's ultraviolet rays.
Environmentalists hope that giving the giant mammals some sanctuary will  mean that numbers will grow, no mean feat considering that whales have a  gestation period estimated at eight to 13 months and grow slowly to adulthood.
