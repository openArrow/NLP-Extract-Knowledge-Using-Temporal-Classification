<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><TimeML><TIMEX3 tid="t0" functionInDocument="CREATION_TIME"/>Bergkamp has had a mixed first season in Italy with Inter Milan but in the  orange national shirt he <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">enhanced</EVENT> his international reputation with the  crucial goals that ended England's interest in the competition.&#13;
In Brian Roy of Foggia and Ajax's Marc Overmars, Advocaat can <EVENT eid="e2" class="I_ACTION" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="can">call</EVENT> on a  pair of lively young wingers capable of <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">destroying</EVENT> any defence in the world.  Lazio's Aron Winter and Inter Milan's Wim Jonk are likely starters in midfield.&#13;
To <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">add</EVENT> to this formidable array of attacking options, Advocaat can also  <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="can">count</EVENT> on the shooting power of Barcelona's Ronald Koeman -- the sweeper whose  long range <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">strikes</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">made</EVENT> him the top scorer in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE">this year</TIMEX3>'s European Cup.&#13;
But while Holland are a match for anybody going forward, they <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">look</EVENT>  vulnerable defensively. Koeman and the gnarled veteran Jan Wouters have a  wealth of experience but the Dutch back four <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">looking</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e10" class="I_STATE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">vulnerable</EVENT> to pace.&#13;
Advocaat, <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">dubbed</EVENT> Napoleon because of his remarkable resemblence to the  little general, might be <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="might">forced</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">deploy</EVENT> Rijkaard in the back four rather  than in the midfield role he <EVENT eid="e14" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">prefers</EVENT>.&#13;
If the defence does <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">prove</EVENT> shaky, Advocaat can at least <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="can">count</EVENT> on one of the  safest pairs of hands in international football in Hans Van Breukelen.&#13;
The PSV Eindhoven keeper will be nearly 38 by the time the finals come  round but he is <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">playing</EVENT> as well as ever and is determined to <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">move</EVENT> into  management with a World Cup winners medal in his trophy cabinet.&#13;
