A slapping match between a German girl  and a Turkish girl turned into a full-scale riot here Wednesday, with the  German girl's family loosing dogs against Turks and the Turks defending  themselves with staves, police said Thursday.
The German girl slapped the 13-year-old Turkish girl, which led the  Turkish girl's father to slap the German girl, police said.
A mob of some 150 Germans then formed and began demonstrating violently  against the presence of two Turkish families living among them in a working  class quarter of Mannheim, police said.
This then escalated into a fight between the Turkish family and German  residents.
The demonstrating neighbours urged the Germans scrapppers on with  anti-foreigner slogans. Police intervened in strength, and said six people  were slightly hurt.
Two hours after the first police intervention, when calm had been retored,  a mob of some 150 German residents gathered again. Shouting racist slogans,  they smashed in the windows of another Turkish family, the police said.
A special team of the Mannheim police was looking for ringleaders.
