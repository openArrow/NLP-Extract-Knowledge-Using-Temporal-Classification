An opposition Senate candidate, Osias Arciniegas, said that the elections  were called off in two southern areas.
Local authorities scrapped the poll in the communities of Banica  Comendador and Llanos after discovering that the voting lists only named  supporters of the ruling Reformist Social Christian Party, Arciniegas said.
The ruling party noted that the abstention rate was only 10 percent, and  argued that if there were irregularities they were minimal and not on the  scale claimed by the opposition.
"Definitely, I believe that the elections have been clean and pure and I  think that the international observers have to testify to that," Balaguer said  in comments quoted by the local press.
An estimated 400 international observers, including a team from the  Organization of American States (OAS), were on hand for Monday's elections.
Luis Ayala, president of the Socialist International for Latin America,  said there were "serious and grave irregularities that have affected the  conduct of truly free, fair and informed elections."
However, former president Juan Bosch, candidate of the Dominican  Liberation Party, who placed third with an estimated 13 percent of the vote,  said he accepted the official results.
"Fraud is normal in the Dominican Republic in the current situation," he  said.
