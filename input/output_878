An explosion at an arms depot in the Russian Far  East blew up 1,600 tonnes of missiles, mines and shells, local administration  chief Yevgeni Nazdratenko said in Vladivostok on Monday.
The blast on Saturday 100 kilometres (60 miles) from Vladivostok spread  over a 10-kilometres (six miles) radius where villages had to be evacuated, he  said, ITAR-TASS news agency reported.
The remaining weapons at the Pacific fleet depot were being made safe  before being deliberately destroyed, and the arms dump would not be rebuilt,  Nazdratenko said. The cause of the blast was not immediately known.
