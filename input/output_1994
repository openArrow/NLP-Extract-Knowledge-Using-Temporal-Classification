China Thursday backed a proposal by Cambodia's  King Norodom Sihanouk for roundtable peace talks to end the fighting in his  country.
Foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said "we highly appreciate and  support King Sihanouk's efforts in realizing national reconciliation and  maintaining peace and stability in Cambodia."
King Sihanouk reiterated Wednesday his proposal for the different factions  in Cambodia to come together for talks in the North Korean capital Pyongyang  on May 27 to end the fighting between the government and Khmer Rouge  guerrillas.
"We sincerely hope that setting store by their national interests, the  Cambodian leaders of various parties will, with the spirit of mutual  understanding and mutual accommodation, make joint efforts for national  reconciliation," Wu said.
Also Thursday, reacting to a US proposal for multinational military aid to  the Cambodian government, another spokesman said China "always hopes that the  support and assistance offered by the international community to Cambodia  should help" maintain peace and stability there and foster reconcilliation.
Winston Lord, the US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and  Pacific affairs, interviewed from Sydney on Wednesday, said that Washington  was holding talks with Australia and Association of Southeast Asian Nations  countries on providing military aid to Phnom Penh to help it fight the Khmer  Rouge.
