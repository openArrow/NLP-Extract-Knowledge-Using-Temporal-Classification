His performances in Italy were hampered by a left ankle that was  permanently pumped full of painkillers, although he was still good enough to  make the goal that put Brazil out of the competition and lead Argentina to the  final.
But ever since then his career has been in freefrall. A routine drugs test  the following year revealed traces of cocaine and prompted the 15-month ban.  Allegations of involvement in importing the drug followed but have not been  proved.
It took the personal intervention of FIFA's top brass to allow Maradona,  by now desperate to get away from Naples, to resume his career with Sevilla.  But their efforts were wasted.
Maradona's second spell in Spain was nearly as miserable as the first. He  failed to recover his former sharpness and got quickly disillusioned with  having to train every day.
His Sevilla career ended in disgrace with an arrest for driving through  red lights and a public bust up with Carlos Bilardo, the Sevilla manager who  had coached Argentina in 1986.
By that time he had been dropped from the national side after a brief  comeback in the spring of 1993.
In fact, had Argentina not been thrashed 5-0 at home by Columbia, it is  unlikely that Maradona would ever have got back into Alfio Basile's line-up.
Columbia's win forced Argentina into a humiliating play-off with Australia  to book their place in the finals.
In need of a saviour, there was only one place Basile could turn.
