The Tibetan government in exile, in a statement  on the United States' renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation status, said  Friday that continued pressure by Washington would force Beijing into talks  with the Dalai Lama.
International relations minister Kalon Tashi Wangdon declined to directly  criticise the renewal but obliquely referred to rights violations saying:  "Unfortunately there has been no improvement in conditions inside Tibet."
"Over the past few years, the United States has made serious efforts to  bring about positive changes in China's policies towards Tibet," he said. "The  Dalai Lama's efforts to start negotiations has been personally acknowledged by  President Clinton.
"We appreciate his (Clinton's) renewed commitment in the process of  negotiations and feel that this pressure is critical," the statement, issued  from the Tibetan headquarters in the northern town of Dharamsala, added.
Wangdon said economic sanctions would improve Beijing's human rights  record.
"We hope the United States and the international community will continue  to use their economic leverage to pressure China to improve its treatment of  the Chinese and Tibetan people and foster negotiations on Tibet," he said.
"It is our belief that concerted international pressures can have a  tremendous practical impact as it did in South Africa.
The Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama set up a government in exile  in Dharamsala after he fled his country in 1959 following a failed uprising  against Chinese rule. More than 100,000 Tibetans live in India.
