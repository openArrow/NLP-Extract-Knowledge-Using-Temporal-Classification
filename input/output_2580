But the ruling Christian Social Reformist Party issued a statement  Thursday that it was "on permanent watch to defend the triumph of Joaquin  Balaguer," a blind 87-year-old who first served as president in 1960 under  then-dictator Rafael Trujillo.
Both Balaguer and electoral officials said that the vote was clean.
The Foreign Ministry accused the foreign press of an international  conspiracy to force a merger between Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
The election was a hot topic of discussion in the corner stores where  Dominicans of all social classes, genders and ages mix.
Shouting over merengue music, some defend Balaguer and electoral officials  while others back Pena Gomez, who the ruling party has reviled as the "son of  Haitians."
The beaches, on the other hand, are deserted.
This has made business leaders nervous since an estimated 70 percent of  the Dominican Republic's hard currency comes from tourism, primarily from the  United States and Europe.
