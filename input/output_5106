The hopes of 1988 finalist Natalia Zevereva were dashed on the stadium's  new ultra-modern 'A' court by home player Julie Halard.
The 23-year-old French girl, who has risen to 24th in the world rankings  after an excellent season, scored a superb 7-6 (7/2), 7-5 win.
Halard, recent winner at Taranto and runner-up at the Paris Indoor Open in  March, refused to be intimidated by opponent or surroundings.
