India on Saturday paid homage to slain prime  minister Rajiv Gandhi on the third anniversary of his assassination which is  being marked with pledges to fight terrorism.
Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma, Gandhi's Italian-born widow Sonia  and daughter Priyanka and a host of ministers, placed wreaths at his memorial  set in a sprawling park here, reports said.
Hymns and prayers were chanted in the verdant Vir Sthal (Abode of the  Brave) memorial as thousands of people queued up to remember India's youngest  premier who was killed by a woman suicide bomber during an election tour.
Memorial services were held across the country as a multitude of Indians,  especially students, vowed to combat terrorism and militancy, the Press Trust  of India (PTI) said.
Indian authorities have said Gandhi's assassination was carried out by Sri  Lanka's main Tamil separatist group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, to  avenge India's June 1987 intervention in the island's Tamil conflict.
A team of students from the southern state of Tamil Nadu, where Gandhi was  killed, began a trip to an unscaled peak in the Himalayas which they intend to  climb and name after the dead leader, PTI said.
Vice President K.R. Narayanan paid rich tributes to Gandhi during a speech  here on Friday, saying he had ushered in technological advances to "bring a  new dynamism to the country's development."
Recalling his fight against South Africa's apartheid regime, Narayanan  said Gandhi had consistently advocated intensified trade sanctions against  Pretoria by Commonwealth countries and championed the cause of the Third World.
Hundreds of mourners thronged the southern town of Sriperumbudur, some 40  kilometres (25 miles) from the Tamil Nadu capital Madras, where Gandhi was  killed, PTI said.
The Gandhis are commonly referred to as India's first family. Rajiv's  maternal grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru and slain mother Indira Gandhi were both  former Indian prime ministers.
