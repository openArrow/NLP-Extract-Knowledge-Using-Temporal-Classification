Cheered on by the partisan fans packed into the Stadium's new 'A'  showcourt, Halard refused to be intimidated by either her Belarus opponent or  the occasion.
The winner of this year's Taranto tournament and runner-up at the Paris  Indoor Open, Halard went for her shots and often left Zvereva, the 1988  finalist, gasping.
Petra Ritter ended the hopes of 21-year-old Romanian Ruxandra Dragomir,  who defeated Bulgaria's 13th seed Magdalena Maleeva in the first round and  experienced Sandra Cecchini of Italy in the second.
Ritter reached the quarter-finals after completing a 7-6 (7/2), 4-6, 6-0  win.
