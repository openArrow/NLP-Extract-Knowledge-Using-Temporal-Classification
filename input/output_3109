Japan's biggest paper manufacturer New Oji Paper  Co. Ltd. said Monday its pre-tax earnings declined 3.8 percent from a year  earlier to 10.5 billion yen (102 million dollars) in the year to March.
The company, a member of the Mitsui group with major pulp and paper  operations in Brazil, New Zealand and Canada, said sales grew 8.2 percent to  487 billion yen in the same period, boosted by sales of general paper. But  prices for all types of papers were lower, leading to the decline in earnings.
New Oji, formed through the merger of Oji Paper and Kanzaki Paper  Manufacturing in October 1993, forecast improved earnings of 11.5 billion yen  for the current year on sharply higher sales of 530 billion yen.
In the latest year, lower sales of wrapping paper and pulp were offset by  increased sales of general paper, tissues and other paper, and processed goods.
"Demand for paper was forced down by the recession," the company said in a  statement. "The pace of recovery remained very slow and business conditions  were very severe, particularly in the second half of the year."
"In the paper division, we were able to report increased sales following  the merger but business conditions were tight because of the delayed recovery.  In the processing division, sales were boosted by brisk imports. Sales of  nappies, especially for old people, and wet tissue paper picked up."
