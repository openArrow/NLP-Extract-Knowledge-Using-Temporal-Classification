Tajik government and opposition leaders are to met  here in June to resume UN-sponsored talks to resolve the crisis in Tajikistan,  Iranian officials said Friday.
A first round of talks between the democratic and Islamic opposition and  the pro-communist government was held in Moscow in March, after the  assassination of Deputy Prime Minister Mouzabcho Nazarchoiev, but without  progress.
However, a leading member of the the Islamic Movement of Tajikistan (IMT),  Akbar Turjanzadeh, predicted earlier this week that the two sides could reach  a settlement in Tehran, according to the Iranian news agency IRNA.
A special UN envoy on Tajikistan, Pierre Baben, met Thursday with Iran's  deputy foreign minister Mahmud Vaezi, who confirmed that Iran, Russia,  Afghanistan and Pakistan would attend as observers.
Vaezi said Tehran favored a "peaceful solution to the crisis" through the  formation of a "national reconciliation government," official Iranian sources  said.
Baben thanked Iran for its "constructive efforts" in helping bring peace  to Tajikistan, the sources added.
Tajik opposition groups agreed to hold direct talks with the Dushanbe  government after Iran and Russia offered to mediate.
Neo-communists took power in Dushanbe in December 1992, unseating the  ruling coalition of democratic and Islamic forces.
The Tajik opposition is currently made up of the IMT, the Democratic Party  of Tajikistan, the Popular Resurrection Movement and the Popular Movement of  Badakhshan.
