President Bill Clinton said Friday that the US  armed forces are capable of waging two conflicts "nearly simultaneously,"  according to a White House statement released here Friday.
As part of the "National Military Strategy" - the Clinton administration  effort to cut military expenditures - Clinton must provide the assurance that  the United States is capable of waging two Gulf War-sized conflicts at once.
Traditionally, US military doctrine stipulates that the United States must  be able to fight two major conflicts at the same time.
The philosophy is aimed at preventing one nation from attempting to profit  militarily while the United States is tied up in another conflict.
Numerous voices have risen in the last year, notably from the Republican  opposition, warning Clinton against cutting defense too deeply.
According to these critics, such cuts put at risk US ability to win two  simultaneous conflicts.
Clinton's announcement comes as Congress is debating the nearly 263  billion dollar defense appropriation for 1995-1996.
Defense supporters prevailed in a House vote Friday, refusing to cut the  three billion dollar deployment of D-5 nuclear missiles for submarines.
A Cold War weapon, the Navy had argued for upgrading its current missile  stock instead of deploying the D-5.
In his letter to the Senate and House of Representatives, Clinton said, "I  am hereby certifying that the Army is capable of providing sufficient forces  (excluding forces engaged in peacekeeping operations and other operations  other than war) to carry out two major regional conflicts nearly  simultaneously, in accordance with the National Military Strategy."
