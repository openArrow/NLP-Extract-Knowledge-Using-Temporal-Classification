A missile believed to have been fired by north  Yemen forces slammed into an eastern district of Aden early Sunday killing two  people and wounding three others, rescue workers said.
The missile fell on a house in the Khormaqsar district causing widespread  damage and cutting electricity supplies to the area.
All the casualties were from the same family, ambulance crews said.
The attack was the first missile strike on Aden since the proclamation 24  hours ago of an independent state in the south in what used to be the marxist  republic of South Yemen.
Two Scud missiles fell on the port city overnight Thursday as fighting  raged between the northern troops of President Ali Abdallah Saleh and southern  troops backing former vice-president Ali Salem al-Baid.
The attack came two hours after a five-man presidential council was  officially named to head the southern independent state proclaimed overnight  Friday by al-Baid, the leader of the Yemeni Socialist Party, the reformed  ex-ruling party in South Yemen.
The north and south, which united four years ago Sunday, have been  embroiled in a civil war since May 4.
