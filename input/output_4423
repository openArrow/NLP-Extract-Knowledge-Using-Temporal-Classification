Zimbabwe has agreed to supply an infantry  battalion for the UN mission in Rwanda, joining Ghana, Senegal and Ethiopia,  which have each pledged a battalion to the effort, a UN spokesman said  Thursday.
"We are just one battalion short of the five that we need," said UN  spokesman Fred Eckhard said at a news conference. "We are reasonably confident  that we can get this fifth battalion."
He did not say which country would provide the final battalion, but  Nigeria has been mentioned recently as a likely candidate.
The UN must now focus on getting together the supplementary equipment  needed by the battalion and find another 1,100 men for support units.
Boutros-Ghali estimates that 5,500 soldiers are needed for a new  humanitarian mission in Rwanda, which has been engulfed in ethnic fighting  since April 15 when its president was killed in a suspicious plane crash.
