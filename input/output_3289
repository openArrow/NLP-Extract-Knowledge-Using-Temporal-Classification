Another difference is Byron Scott, a member of three NBA title winners for  the Los Angeles Lakers who joined Indiana this year as a free agent. He  brought the Pacers veteran leadership and long-range shooting touch.
"I think this team can match what I achieved with the Lakers," Scott said.  "It's nice to go for the championship again. When I came here, I thought we  could make the finals. This is something they're not used to. These guys are  young. But they've answered the call."
Dutch center Rik Smits, who stands 2.2 meters, has been a major factor in  Indiana's improvement. Smits averaged 15.7 points a game, the best in his six  NBA seasons, plus 3.8 rebounds a game.
"There have been periods this year where Rik has been among the top big  men in the league," Brown said. "He has been pretty damn good. If we have any  hope of moving on, he's going to have to be a big factor."
Smits had a particularly strong series against New York last year, when  the Knicks eliminated Indiana in the first playoff round. Smits averaged 22.5  points and 8.0 rebounds against New York star Patrick Ewing.
"Rik just goes through people and if they want to double-team him, that  leaves somebody open," Walsh said.
The Pacers also relied on aggressive defense, forcing opponents into  turnovers and bad shots.
"I can't say enough about our defense," said Haywoode Workman, a reserve  who worked his way into a starting role with tough defense. "When this team  plays good, strong defense we can beat anybody in the league."
Miller led the Pacers with 19.9 points this season and was among the  league's most accurate shooters from the free-throw line as well as  three-point range. He was also selected to the US team for this year's World  Championships.
"This is a whole new situation for most of us," Miller said. "Nothing was  expected of us, so we're just going out to have fun."
