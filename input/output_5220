International sanctions imposed against Belgrade  for backing separatist Bosnian Serbs have cost the country 45 billion dollars  since they were imposed two years ago, the daily Politika reported Sunday.
Citing government experts, the newspaper said that in the first year of  the embargo, imposed by the United Nations on May 31, 1992, industrial  production dropped by 20 percent on 1991, and by nearly 40 percent in the  second year.
Compared to 1989 production had dropped by two thirds, the paper said,  adding that consumption had dropped by 53 percent in the first year of   sanctions and 74.5 percent in the second.
The embargo was imposed in a bid to pressure Belgrade into helping to stop  the fighting in neighbouring Bosnia-Hercegovina, where Bosnian Serbs have  seized most of the country's territory in a war against Bosnian Moslems and  Croats.
President Slobodan Milosevic has repeatedly called for the sanctions to be  lifted, but western leaders are reluctant to relax the ban so long as the  Bosnian conflict continues.
