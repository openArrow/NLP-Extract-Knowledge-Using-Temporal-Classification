Singapore Airlines (SIA) should post a marginal  to modest growth in earnings in the current fiscal year following a six  percent drop in net profit last year, industry analysts said Friday.
Keen competition, depreciation costs and high operating expenses would eat  into earnings of one of the world's most profitable airlines, they said.
SIA earlier this week said group net earnings for the year ended March 31,  dropped 5.8 percent to 801 million Singapore dollars (520 million US).
The airline blamed cut-throat competition and the strong Singapore dollar  for the poor showing.
"Although the results are a dip from last year, they are still good when  compared to the global performance," said Alex Chng Beng Hock, research  manager at stockbroker Alliance Securities.
An airline analyst with a listed local stockbrokerage forecast a one  percent increase in net profits, saying last year's earnings were inflated by  a 70.8 million dollar gain from share sales during the stock market boom.
Another airline analyst at Alliance Securities forecast a net earnings  growth of about six percent in 1995 and 11 percent in 1996.
The research director of a European brokerage forecast a nine percent hike  in earnings, saying yields, which fell 6.5 percent last year, would continue  to drop, though at slower pace because of weakness in the US and European  markets.
Subsidiary Silkair, serving a booming regional market, will also make an  important contribution to SIA's bottomline, analysts said.
They said SIA had also won more flights to China and Vietnam which would  help offset lower yields in the US and European markets.
