Perry
WASHINGTON, May 18 (AFP) - Defense Secretary William Perry said the United  States may face an escalating crisis if North Korea continues doing nothing to  dispel suspicions that it is developming nuclear weapons.
The United States faces "a very substantial near-term crisis" with North  Korea, Perry said at the close Tuesday of a two-day visit to Canada.
He said Pyongyang would take two months to remove and replace spent fuel  rods at an experimental nuclear reactor that is at the heart of a standoff  with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
"If we don't have it resolved at the end of this time, then they may have  processed this spent fuel into weapons-grade plutonium and we would have lost  that opportunity to stop this event from happening," Perry said.
He said a crisis was developing not only because there was such little  time but "because of the potential that there will be, in time, the  involvement of nuclear weapons."
"The objective of the United States has been to curtail this program  before it gets started," Perry said.
North Korea said it would allow IAEA inspectors to observe the refuelling  proceedure at the experimental plant, but not to take samples, without which  the UN agency said it would be impossible to determine whether plutonium has  been diverted to a clandestine nuclear arms program.
Three IAEA officials arrived Tuesday in North Korea to inspect the suspect  experimental plant in Yongbyon, 90 kilometers (55 miles) north of Pyongyang.
Washington and the IAEA have warned North Korea that it could be hit with  UN sanctions if it continues to flout nuclear non-proliferation agreements.
North Korea has warned that sanctions could lead to war.
"I do believe that this is rhetoric on the part of the North Koreans,"  Perry said. He added, however, that the United States must be prepared in case  the threat is real.
