Israeli President Ezer Weizman said  Sunday Israel would maintain its self-declared "security zone" in southern  Lebanon until its fate had been decided in the Arab-Israeli peace process.
He was speaking during a tour of the region, his first since he was  elected in 1993, to congratulate local leaders on the Moslem feast of Al-Adha.
He said Israel was determined to back its militia forces the South  Lebanese Army (SLA), which have been targetted in most of the anti-Israeli  attacks in the area.
"Rest assured that we have done a lot for the border security zone and we  will never abandon you to chance before being sure that the peace process is  going in the right direction," he said.
Israel is trying to obtain guarantees that the SLA will be integrated into  the Lebanese army in exchange for an Israeli retreat from the 1,000 square  kilometres (400 square miles) region which it has occupied since 1978.
Weizman was accompanied by Deputy Chief-of-Staff Amnon Shahak and the head  of the SLA militia Antoine Lahad.
Bilateral peace talks between Israel and Lebanon have been stalled since a  Jewish settler killed 30 Arab worshippers in a Hebron mosque on Febraury 25.
