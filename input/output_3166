Another early injury victim was Mikael Pernfors who had to retire in his  first-round match against fellow-Swedish quaifier Lars Jonsson.
The 1986 finalist was trailing 5-7, 2-6, and had just been broken at the  start of the third set when he told the umpire he would have to stop because  of a deteriorating injury to his left foot.
Jonsson, 23, who reached the third-round here two years ago, now plays  either Henri Leconte of France or Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands.
Japan's Naoko Sawamatsu made a hesitant start but surged back to beat  Italian qualifier Laura Garrone 4-6, 6-4, 6-0.
Dutch player Stephanie Rottier made sure she is Graf's next opponent by  defeating Natalia Medvedeva of the Ukraine 6-2, 3-6, 6-3.
