President Bill Clinton was to name Stephen  Breyer, a Massachusetts federal judge, as his nominee to the US Supreme Court,  an administration official said Friday.
Breyer, 55, seen as a moderate consensus-builder, had been favored by  Clinton last year before he named Ruth Ginsburg.
Clinton's decision ends speculation over the nominee to replace Justice  Harry Blackmun, who is retiring, on the highest US court -- one of the three  centers of power under the US constitution.
Named for life, the nine Supreme Court justices have a huge role in  determining the course of American society.
In recent decades, the court has ended segregation, given blacks political  power, legalized abortion and restored the death penalty.
