The United States is willing to help the United  Nations strengthen a mission aimed at ending the carnage in Rwanda, but has no  plans to involve US troops, the White House said Friday.
President Bill Clinton told UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali at  a White House meeting that Washington would continue helping find countries  willing to send troops to the African country where an estimated 200,000  people have been slaughtered in ethnic fighting.
"President Clinton reiterated his commitment to assisting the UN mission  in Rwanda by providing equipment, airlift to the region and continued help in  recruiting additional forces," the White House said in a statement.
Boutros-Ghali, who earlier this week lamented what he called a failure and  scandal among the international community on Rwanda, said he hoped the United  States and other countries would play a greater role in ending the Rwandan  crisis.
A UN plan to boost the peacekeping mission to 5,500 troops remained 1,100  troops short of its goal, according to UN officials.
Washington's most recent policy on international peacekeeping sets strict  criteria for US involvement that would appear to rule out sending troops to  Rwanda.
The African country erupted in fighting after the death of president  Juvenal Habyarimana in an April 6 plan crash believed to have been caused by a  rocket attack.
