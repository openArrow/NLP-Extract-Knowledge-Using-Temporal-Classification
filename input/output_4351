Four armed men who took a busload of about 50  people hostage in southern Russia Thursday released the last of the eight  children they were holding captive, the local police chief said.
Stavropol police chief General Ivan Tetereviatnikov told AFP by telephone  that after the latest release, the hostage-takers were still holding 13  adults.
Security forces had allowed the bus to approach the airport in Mineralnoye  Vody surrounded by police vehicles, Tetereviatnikov said. The kidnapping took  place near the town earlier Thursday.
No decision had been taken concerning the kidnappers' demand for a  helicopter to enable them to flee, he added.
Officials earlier said the four men, armed with submachineguns and a  grenade, had also demanded a 10-million-dollar ransom.
Previously, Tetereviatnikov had said the hostage-takers were holding one  child and 19 adults after releasing 23 adults, in two stages, and seven  children earlier in the afternoon.
They then freed the last child hostage and another group of adults,  Tetereviatnikov said.
About 800 policemen and security officers were dispatched to the site of  the hostage-taking to negotiate with the gunmen, he said.
