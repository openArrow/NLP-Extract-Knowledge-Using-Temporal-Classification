Environment Minister Yossi Sarid commented Monday that the clashes in  Hebron, which was under curfew on Tuesday, showed that peaceful co-existence  between Israelis and Palestinian was all but impossible.
"The incidents prove once again that co-existence is complicated,  dangerous and apparently impossible.
"The government will soon have to look again at the decision to allow  settlers to remain in Hebron," he said.
According to an army inquiry about 30 armed settlers from the nearby  hardline settlement of Kyriat Arba went into the town centre on foot and were  stoned by Palestinians. At least two opened fire. Then when troops arrived and  were also stoned they too fired on the crowd.
Hebron Mayor Mustapha Natche accused the settlers of shooting for 40  minutes before soldiers turned up.
He demanded the curfew be lifted. "There is no reason why the Palestinian  people should be punished for the exactions of settlers," he told state radio.
International observers stationed in Hebron to try to improve security for  the Palestinians in the aftermath of the mosque massacre said they were also  carrying out an inquiry into the shootings.
More than 400 Jews have settled in the middle of Hebron, home to about  120,000 Palestinians, and site of the Tomb of the Patriarchs, which is holy in  Judaism and Islam alike.
