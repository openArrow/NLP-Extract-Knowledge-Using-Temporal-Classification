A British Airways jumbo jet carrying 331 people  landed safely at Narita airport Thursday after its captain died of a suspected  heart attack while on a flight from London, airline and airport officials said.
The death of the captain, David Robertson, was not announced in flight,  passengers said.
"There was an announcement in English that someone was taken ill but it  did not specify who it was," a young Japanese male passenger told a Tokyo  television network.
The Boeing 747-400 touched down at Narita at 8:32 a.m. (2332 GMT) after  its two co-pilots took turns at the controls, the officials said.
Robertson died during a regular rest break some five hours after departing  London while the plane was over Russia, and was found dead by other members of  the crew, the officials said.
