Nine of Japan's 11 city banks announced further  declines in consolidated pre-tax earnings for the year to March with only  three forecasting improvements in the current year, on Thursday.
The banks, still reeling from the orgy of speculative lending to the  once-booming property sector, also said they had written off a combined 2,000  billion yen (19.4 billion dollars) in bad loans during the year.
But the 11 banks said they still had 8,900 billion yen in non-performing  loans on their books, up five percent from a year earlier.
"We expect the economy to remain stagnant in the current year. We don't  know how soon we can complete the disposal of bad loans," said an official at  Fuji Bank Ltd., currently the biggest bank in terms of global assets.
All of the banks neverthless managed to meet the capital adequacy  guidelines laid down by the Bank of for International Settlements (BIS), which  require capital to equal at least eight percent of risk-weighted assets.
The combined earnings of the city banks were down by a third from the  previous year, marking the fifth consecutive decline.
Only the formerly scandal-ridden Sumitomo Bank Ltd. and Bank of Tokyo  Ltd., which has the biggest overseas presence of all Japanese banks, were able  to post higher profits. Sanwa Bank Ltd. nevertheless managed to retain its  position as the most profitable bank although earnings were more than halved.
Fuji said group pre-tax earnings plunged 31.7 percent from a year earlier  to 68.3 billion yen. The bank, still suffering 1,200 billion yen in bad loans,  said net operating profit from core banking activities tumbled 43.5 percent to  32.9 billion yen. It forecast a lower profit of 65 billion yen for this year.
Sumitomo's earnings jumped 22 percent to 96.8 billion yen with net  operating profit plunging 68.8 percent to 35.6 billion yen. Bad loans came to  1,100 billion yen. The Osaka-based bank also projected lower earnings of 85  billion yen for the current year.
Dai-Ichi Kangkyo Bank Ltd. saw earnings fall 42.7 percent to 68.4 billion  yen. Net operating profit plunged 75 percent to 11.6 billion yen and bad loans  came to 1,300 billion yen. But the bank forecast improved earnings of 70  billion yen in the current year.
Sanwa's earnings tumbled 50.9 percent to 97.1 billion yen with net  operating profit plunging 52 percent to 45.7 billion yen. Bad loans came to  910 billion yen. The bank, also based in Osaka, forecast lower earnings of 95  billion yen.
Sakura Bank Ltd., with 1.4 trillion yen in bad loans, the largest of all  the banks, said earnings plunged 46.8 percent to 65.6 billion yen. Net  operating profit from core activities tumbled 60.4 percent to 22.9 billion  yen. But it projected a sharp recovery in earnings to 90 billion yen in the  current year.
Mitsubishi Bank Ltd. said group pre-tax earnings dived 39.7 percent to 79.8  billion yen while net operating profit was down 24.3 percent at 47.5 billion  yen. Bad loans amounted to 573 billion yen. It expects a further slide in  earnings to 75 billion yen in the current year.
Tokai Bank Ltd. said its earnings dropped 29.4 percent to 49.6 billion  yen. But the Nagoya-based bank said net operating profit leapt 34 percent to  33.9 billion yen. Bad loans came to 768 billion yen and it forecast lower  earnings of 42 billion yen this year.

Bank of Tokyo's earnings rose 18 percent to 92.8 billion yen and net  operating profit soared 33.8 percent to 50.6 billion yen. Bad loans came to  267 billion yen. Even higher earnings of 55 billion yen were projected.
Daiwa Bank Ltd. said earnings were flat at 40 billion yen while net  operating profits dropped 30.1 percent to 12.7 billion yen. Bad loans came to  337 billion yen and lower earnings of 27 billion yen were projected.
Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd. said earnings dived 63.3 percent at 6.6  billion yen. Net operating profit was down 69.3 percent at 2.7 billion yen and  bad  loans came to 508 billion yen. It forecast lower earnings of six billion  yen.
