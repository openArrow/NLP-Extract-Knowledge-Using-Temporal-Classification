Four British passport-holders of Vietnamese  origin, accused of plotting a coup against Sierra Leone's military regime,  went on hunger strike here Tuesday, diplomatic sources said.
The four, Bui Vinh Ly, Bui Hai Ly, Kelvin Chu Kee Law and Nhat Bui Ly,  were arrested in October last year and face trial before the high court here  in September. They risk the death penalty if found guilty.
The diplomatic sources gave no reason for the hunger strike, but sources  close to prison authorities said the four had recently expressed anger at the  slowness of the legal process.
They were arrested in a hotel room five days after they arrived in Sierra  Leone last October and accused of mounting a coup plot against the regime of  Captain Valentine Strasser on behalf of his former right-hand man, sacked  vice-president Solomon Saj Musa.
The four were said to have held two meetings with Captain Musa in  Birmingham, central England, earlier in October, aimed at preparing a coup for  October 16. Maps of Sierra Leone were said to be part of the evidence against  them.
Musa, who played a major role in the April 1992 coup that ousted president  Joseph Momoh and brought Strasser to power, was dismissed in July 1993 and has  been living in exile in Britain since. No official motive was given for his  departure.
Describing the four detainees as "mercenaries," examining magistrate  Joseph Massalay said on May 13 that after a six-month investigation, he had  enough evidence against them to put them on trial.
In December 1992, 26 people accused of plotting a coup were shot by firing  squad on the orders of the junta. The executions sparked international  protests.
