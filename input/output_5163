"I only saw her play yesterday," admitted Graf,"And I thought she played a  bit like me."
She added with a smile: "...And I know what to do against myself."
Graf, who has beaten Pierce in both of their previous encounters, refused  to be drawn into any predictions about a potential semi-final clash.
"Right now I'm not looking that far," she said. "It doesn't concern me. I  am just looking forward to my next match. After that we shall see."
