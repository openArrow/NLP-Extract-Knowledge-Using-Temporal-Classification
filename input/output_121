An inventive Japanese housing cooperative is  undercutting market prices by as much as a fifth, enabling it to sell a tiny  home in the Tokyo suburbs for the (comparatively) rock-bottom price of 465,000  dollars.
The cooperative, West Tokyo Home Center, purchases the land and carries  out the construction itself, thus cutting out layers of intermediaries who  inflate property prices, the Mainichi daily said Friday.
The home, measuring 89 square metres (957 square feet), lies on a tiny  parcel of land of 109 square metres (1,171 square feet) at Higashi-Kurume, a  40-minute train ride from central Tokyo.
Housing prices in Japanese cities are notoriously high, although they have  recently dropped, reflecting the country's economic difficulties, and the fall  has accelerated this year.
