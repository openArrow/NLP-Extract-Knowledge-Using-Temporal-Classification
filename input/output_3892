President Nelson Mandela said Wednesday he was  prepared to meet neo-Nazi leader Eugene Terre'Blanche, if it would help draw  South Africa's far white right-wing into peaceful negotiations.
Mandela was speaking after meeting Ferdi Hartzenberg, leader of the  pro-apartheid Conservative Party, which boycotted last month's historic  all-race poll, saying the new constitution did not accomodate the right-wing's  demand for a separate white homeland.
Hartzenberg said he would ask Terre'Blanche, who heads the extremist  Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB), if he would meet Mandela.
Mandela said he would hold talks with Terre'Blanche to "address the  problems of the ultra-right so it can be included in the process of using  peaceful methods."
However, Terre'Blanche ruled out meeting Mandela until all right-wingers  in jail or awaiting trial were released.
The AWB leader said in a statement Wednesday that a pre-condition for a  meeting with Mandela was the granting of amnesty to right-wingers accused or  convicted of what he termed political crimes.
Thirty-two AWB members are awaiting trial for a bombing spree in the two  days before the election that killed 21 people, and among the right-wingers in  jail are Janusz Walus and Clive Derby-Lewis, the assassins of communist leader  and black hero, Chris Hani.
