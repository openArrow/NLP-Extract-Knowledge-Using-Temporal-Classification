Turkey accused Greece Wednesday of training  guerrilla units in the separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) to carry out  attacks on economic, military and tourist targets.
Greek ambassador to Ankara Alexander Philon was summoned May 18 to the  Turkish foreign ministry to be told of "confessions" made by a group of PKK  members recently arrested by police in Istanbul, a Turkish government source  told AFP.
The source said a group of 20 PKK militants arrived in Athens from  Frankfurt last February to be trained for bomb attacks on targets in Ankara,  Istanbul and Antalya, Turkey's main Mediterranean spa resort.
They entered Turkey by crossing the river Maritza, which runs along the  Greek-Turkish border. Turkish police had since seized documents relating to a  series of planned attacks, the source added.
Unal Unsal, a junior minister in the foreign ministry, passed the  information on to the Greek ambassador and demanded an explanation over what  the government source called "a very serious development." He added that the  British, German, French and US ambassadors had also been summoned for a  briefing on the issue.
Four bomb attacks, all attributed to the PKK, have been carried out at  tourist attractions in Istanbul since March 24, killing two foreign tourists  and injuring a total of 22 people.
In a related development, 14 Kurdish rebels have been killed in military  operations since Tuesday in the provinces of Mus and Bingol in eastern Turkey,  officials in Diyarbakir said, while the bodies of 28 rebels killed in recent  clashes near the Iraqi, Iranian and Syrian borders were also reportedly  recovered.
The latest deaths brought to at least 469 the number of rebels killed by  security forces since May 1. Almost 2,000 people, including 122 civilians, are  believed to have died in unrest this year, while almost 13,000 have died in 10  years of conflict since the Kurds began their uprising.
President Suleyman Demirel called for PKK members to hand themselves in to  the authorities, saying there was "no way out" for them in their battle with  the state.
