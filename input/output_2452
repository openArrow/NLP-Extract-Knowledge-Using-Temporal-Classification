All conscripts in Crimea must fulfill their  military service within the peninsula, according to a bill adopted Friday by  the Crimean parliament, Interfax reported.
The news agency said the resolution meant that conscripts would carry out  their mandatory military service on Crimean territory, either within the army  or with the Black Sea Fleet based in Sevastopol.
Interfax added that the military official in charge of conscription in  Crimea told parliament that he could not apply the decision as he was under  the authority of the Ukranian president, who is the commander-in-chief of the  armed forces.
But the commander-in-chief of the disputed Black Sea Fleet, Rear Admiral  Alexander Frolov, a deputy, told the lawmakers that his fleet was "ready to  enrol all of Crimea's conscripts."
The new bill concerning conscripts followed a vote by parliament to  restore a 1992 constitution, a move that amounted to a declaration of  independence from Ukraine.
