Russia's emerging pro-life movement holds its first  conference here this week to map out a strategy to curb the abortion rate,  which is among the highest in the world, the president of the Right to Live  organisation said Tuesday.
Galina Sieryakova told AFP that the three-day conference beginning  Wednesday would allow the Russian anti-abortion movement to recruit new  members in cities and towns across the country and to launch an information  campaign against abortion.
"After more than 70 years of communism, women must know that abortion is  not something normal," Sieryakova said.
One out of every four abortions in the world are performed in Russia,  according to the organisation's estimates and Russian women on average have at  least four abortions in their child-bearing years.
Abortion is widely used in Russia as the main method of contraception and  other means of birth control are expensive and scarcely available.
Sieryakova said the Right to Live movement, which was founded in 1992 with  20 members, now had over 1,000 members, most of whom were active in Moscow,  Saint Petersburg and in the Siberian city of Novossibirk.
The conference entitled "Love, Life, Family" is sponsored by Human Life  International, a European-based pro-life movement, and will open with an  address by Patriarch Aleksy II of the Russian Orthodox Church.
About 300 people are expected to attend the conference that will also  include presentations from officials representing the social welfare ministry.
