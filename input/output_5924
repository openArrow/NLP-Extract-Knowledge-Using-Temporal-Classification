Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams called late  Tuesday for an amnesty for political prisoners, as one of several steps needed  to boost the peace process in Northern Ireland.
The "speedy release of all long-term prisoners, pending a full amnesty for  all political prisoners, must be matter of urgent concern," Adams told a  European Union election meeting held here by Sinn Fein, the political wing of  the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
Although this is not the first time Sinn Fein has called for a full  amnesty, it has reinforced speculation that the party is seeking further  concessions before responding to the Downing Street Declaration for peace in  the British province.
Sinn Fein has so far neither accepted nor rejected December's joint  declaration by the British and Irish premiers, which promised the party a  place in talks if the IRA renounced violence in its campaign for union with  the Irish republic, and called for further "clarification."
The British government provided a partial amplification last month, but on  Tuesday Adams repeated that this would not be examined until after the  European elections on June 9.
Instead he gave a list of requirements which partly contradict the  declaration, saying Sinn Fein would have to ensure there was no return to  domination by the Ulster unionists from the Protestant majority, who support  British rule in Northern Ireland.
And he added that the British government should "write into new  legislation" the right of the Irish people to national self-determination.
At the same time, the government should legislate away provisions which  provided unionists with a veto over political and constitutional change.
Other demands included ending "repressive legislation" such as the  Prevention of Terrorism Act and the Emergency Provision Act which gives police  special powers in dealing with alleged terrorists.
