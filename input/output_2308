Vietnam plans to treble its output of refined sugar  to one million tonnes a year by 2000 to meet rising demand from the food  processing industry, a report said Friday.
Two sugar mills are to be renovated at a cost of 14 million dollars, while  two more will be built with combined capacity to process 5,500 tonnes of  sugarcane a day, the Vietnam News Agency reported.
The two new mills are expected to cost 30 million dollars each and will be  funded through domestic investment, the report said, adding that demand from  the food processing industry meant Vietnam needed to more than triple its  output of 300,000 tonnes a year.
Plans are also afoot for four joint-venture refining plants with  capacities for between 3,000 and 6,000 tonnes a day, said Bui Quang Vinh,  general director of the Union of Sugarcane Enterprises.
To provide enough sugarcane, annual output of the crop needs to be  increased from six million tonnes to about 15 million tonnes, Vinh said,  adding that the government should provide low interest loans and preferential  prices to farmers growing the crop.
Taiwan Sugar Corp., a state-run firm that is one of the largest producers  and refiners in Asia, signed a deal last month to build a 66 million dollar  refinery with a capacity of 90,000 tonnes a year.
A British-Vietnamese joint venture has also been expanding the Thanh Hoa  mill at a cost of 50 million dollars to lift capacity to 6,000 tonnes a day.
