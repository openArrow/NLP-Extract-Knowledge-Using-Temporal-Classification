Japan should draw a lesson from the row that  erupted earlier this month when a Japanese minister defended the country's  militarist past, Chinese President Jiang Zemin was quoted as saying Wednesday.
"Not long ago, an issue which ran counter to history and to the popular  will of (the Japanese and Chinese) people, caused disharmony," Jiang said,  referring to remarks by former Japanese justice minister Shigeto Nagano that  the 1937 massacre of Chinese civilians in Nanjing by Japanese troops was a  hoax.
"Past experience, if not forgotten, is a guide for the future," Jiang was  quoted as saying by the China Daily.
The president was speaking Tuesday to the visiting secretary general of  Japan's Social Democratic Party (SDP) Kubo Wataru.
Nagano was eventually forced to resign after giving an interview to a  leading Japanese newspaper asserting that the Nanjing massacre -- in which up  to 300,000 Chinese lost their lives -- was a "fabrication" and that it was  "wrong" to call the Pacific War one of aggression.
Only with an accurate view of history and only when Sino-Japanese  friendship is maintained, can the two peoples remain amiable for generations,"  Jiang said.
For his part, Kubo said the SDP considered an accurate treatment of  history an issue of "major significance."
