Chinese dissident intellectual Yu Haocheng left  Beijing Saturday for the United States, more than three years after he first  applied to the authorities here for an exit visa, his wife said.
"Yu left this morning on a Northwest Airlines flight for New York," where  he is to take up a research and teaching post at Columbia University, his wife  said.
A leading expert on constitutional law, the 68-year-old Yu was placed  under house arrest in the northern suburbs of Beijing for more than one year  after the June 1989 pro-democracy crackdown.
On May 14, 1989, Yu had joined 11 other intellectuals in a public appeal  to the government to declare the student-led pro-democracy campaign "a  patriotic democracy movement."
Formerly a director of the Public Security Department's Masses Publishing  House, Yu was effectively forced into retirement in 1986 for allegedly  publishing "questionable" books and advocating political and legal reforms.
Since his release from house arrest in late 1990, he continued to speak  out on the need for fundamental legal reforms and to publish dissident-style  views in the foreign media.
Yu's repeated applications to leave China so that he might accept  invitations from abroad had previously all been turned down, but he finally  received a passport on May 9.
The decision to grant Yu a passport was widely seen as as a gesture to the  United States in the run up to President Bill Clinton's decision on whether to  renew China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) trading status.
Freedom to leave China had been one of the conditions set by Washington  for MFN renewal.
Clinton renewed China's MFN Thursday with only limited sanctions, and  abandoned his policy of linking trade issues with human rights.
