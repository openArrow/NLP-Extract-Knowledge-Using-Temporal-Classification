Russian writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn will end 20  years in exile and return home on May 27, his wife said Friday.
Solzhenitsyn, who has been living in the small town of Cavendish, Vermont  in the north-east of the United States will fly to Vladivostok in the Russian  Far East via Anchorage, Alaska and then on across the country, Natalia  Solzhenitsyn said in a communique.
She said in the statement which was issued from Cavendish and received  here that Solzhenitsyn would embark on a "trip across Russia in order to  acquaint himself with the current condition of our homeland."
"We leave Vermont with a warm feeling of gratitude," the she said, adding  "We go to Russia with great concern for her present state, but with hope for  her future recovery."
Solzhenitsyn, considered the greatest living Russian writer, was arrested  and expelled from the Soviet Union because of his works in 1974. He won the  Nobel Prize for Literature in 1970.
