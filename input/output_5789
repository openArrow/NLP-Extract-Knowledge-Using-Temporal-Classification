South Africa's bid to stage the 1996 world  cross country championships in Stellenbosch has won the support from  organisers of the 1995 event.
Allan Wilson, secretary of the organising committee in Durham, said: "With  the advent of a new South Africa it would be nice for them to be awarded such  a high-profile event."
South Africa face a strong challenge from Portugal, who want to stage the  event in the Algarve.
