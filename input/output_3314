A southern missile crashed into the Yemeni capital  on Monday, causing several casualties, the official news agency SABA said.
The agency, run by the north, said the missile landed in a residential  district of Sanaa. There were no immediate details on casualties but Saba said  there were "heavy losses."
It was the first missile attack on Sanaa since the south declared an  independent state on Saturday, after more than two weeks of civil war.
"This cowardly act reflects the hatred of a gang of criminals for the  (Yemeni) people which is fighting to thwart their secessionist plot," a  military spokesman told Saba, without identifying the type of missile fired.
"These criminals and cowards will not escape punishment. They will fall  into the hands of the people and the armed forces to have their punishment,"  the spokesman warned.
The north has now accused the south of firing 22 (eds: correct) missiles  at the capital and other northern cities since the civil war broke out. An  attack on May 11 killed 25 civilians in Sanaa.
Four people were killed and nine wounded in a missile attack Sunday on the  southern port city of Aden, but the north denied it was responsible.
