De Cesaris then took full advantage of a near-20sec pitstop for Alesi, who  needed the nose cone changed on his Ferrari after a minor crunch. Despite the  Frenchman's best efforts, he failed to dislodge the Italian and lost 10  seconds in the final half a dozen laps.
Schumacher's face was wreathed in smiles after the race, but there was  also reason for satisfaction for Brundle and Berger.
The Englishman had brought McLaren-Peugeot another podium finish in their  debut season, after Hakkinen's third place at San Marino, while Berger moved  into second place in the drivers' world championship.
Shortly before the start drivers had paid homage to Senna, the triple  world champion whose death has tended to overshadow that of rookie  Ratzenberger.
The first two places had already been left clear of cars, out of respect  to the dead men. But the drivers gathered together there before making way for  the trio of Brazilians Fittipaldi and Barichello, plus Ratzenberger's teammate  Heinz Harald Frentzen, who moved forward with a Brazilian flag bearing the  words "adeus Ayrton".
The recent accidents have prompted the re-formation of the Grand Prix  Drivers Association, and a raft of new safety measures from the ruling  International Automobile Federation to be introduced over the coming races.
