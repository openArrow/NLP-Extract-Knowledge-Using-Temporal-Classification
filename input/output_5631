North Korean troops on Monday removed their  equipment from the Military Armistice Commission (MAC) hall in the border  truce village of Panmunjom, South Korean Defence Ministry officials said  Tuesday.
The officials said the border guards stripped microphones and speakers  from their side of the hall, which has been used to supervise the truce  between the two Koreas since the MAC was signed after the devastating 1950-53  Korean War.
North Korea unilaterally pulled its MAC representatives out of Panmunjom,  and on May 2 US officials said it had informed the US-led allied command of  its intention to pull out of the MAC altogether.
"We believe the North Koreans pulled out the equipment as a sign of  opposition to the MAC, and to it being led by a South Korean general," a  defence ministry official told AFP.
He said South Korea's equipment remained in place.
