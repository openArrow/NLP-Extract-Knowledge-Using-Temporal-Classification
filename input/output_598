Uzbek President Islam Karimov is to make an  official four-day visit Monday to what he has described as the "incredible,  fairytale land" of Japan, to drum up investment for his struggling central  Asian country.
Business ties between the two countries are very weak, with trade last  year reaching 30 million dollars. This consisted mainly of Uzbek cotton and  gas exports and Japanese imports of high-tech goods such as computers.
Japan could "offer development aid and loans soon" but there has been no  time since the invitation was made late April to draw up any formal  agreements, said Japan's charge d'affaires in Tashkent, Kodzi Hino.
"I cannot say if Uzbekistan is a promising market. Taxes on foreign  businesses are not going in the right direction. None of the joint entreprises  set up to date are really functioning, they only exist on paper," said the  diplomat.
But since relations with Russia are still hampered by territorial  disputes, Japan "cannot neglect central Asia," he added.
Karimov's visit will allow him to "see how the Japanese work" and admire  Uzbek antiquities, brought to Japan 2,000 years ago along the old Silk Route.
Unlike neighbouring Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan has not yet signed an agreement  with the International Monetary Fund which insists on tougher spending and  monetary controls.
A weak currency in the former Soviet republic means that most trade is  carried out as barter and people have little spending power.
Japan does not object, however, to Karimov's authoritarian style which  forbids political opposition.
"Political stability is the most important thing," said Hino.
"If the economic crisis gets worse, (Islamic) fundamentalism will become a  threat here. Most opposition parties are religious and we don't like that."
