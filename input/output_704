In any case, "the bottom line in all this is that you can't buy agreement  either from Pakistan or India on nuclear proliferation issues if they are not  persuaded that this is in their own best security interests," one said.
There has also been friction over Kashmir, with India feeling that the  administration of US President Bill Clinton favors Pakistan in the dispute and  has tacitly encouraged the Moslem insurgency in Kashmir.
Washington denies that Clinton has shifted policy on Kashmir, and says it  is a matter of Indian perception.
The US policy has always been the same -- that the Kashmir dispute is  something that India and Pakistan should work out between them, taking into  account the wishes of the Kashmir people, US officials say.
Rao made it clear this week that he was not about to cause further  ructions at home by making any major concessions on the nuclear  non-proliferation issue during his Washington trip.
Another key element of the visit is the effort to boost the economic  relationship, which has taken off with the opening up of the Indian economy in  the Rao administration.
