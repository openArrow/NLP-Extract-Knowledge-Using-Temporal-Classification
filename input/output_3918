The French state-controlled Thomson-CSF electronics  group expects to report a loss of up to 2.2 billion francs (393 million  dollars) for 1993 but has had to delay publication of its accounts again, the  company said Wednesday.
The main problem concerns recapitalisation of the state-controlled Credit  Lyonnais bank in which Thomson-CSF is a shareholder.
Thomson-CSF finance director Alain Hagelauer said that the company was  prepared to underwrite a fund to hold property debts for the bank to the  extent of 1.8 billion francs.
The bank reported a loss for last year of 6.9 billion francs of which the  proportionate amount bearing on Thomson-CSF is 1.4 billion francs.
Excluding the problems posed by the bank, Thomson-CSF would have reported  a net profit of about one billion francs in 1993, Hagelauer said.
Publication of the accounts had been delayed because of difficulties in  calculating the exact amount of the guarantee to be borne by the company.
The general meeting of shareholders, which was to have been held on June  30, has been delayed indefinitely.
Hagelauer estimated that the experts would have completed their  calculations in three to four weeks' time.
