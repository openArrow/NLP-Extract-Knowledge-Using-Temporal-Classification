The European Commission announced Thursday it  would send 300,000 ecu (345,000 dollars) of emergency humanitarian aid to  civilian victims of the war in Yemen, a spokesman said.
The aid from the European Union's executive will go to finance the  purchase, transport and distribution of medication and medical equipment and  first aid.
That operation, to last three months, will be handled through the  International Committee of the Red Cross.
Residents in Yemen, which was reunited in 1990, have been hard hit in the  civil war that erupted three weeks ago between forces from the former  conservative north and the Marxist south.
