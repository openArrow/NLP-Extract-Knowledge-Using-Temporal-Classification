A southern military spokesman denied Monday  that northern Yemeni forces had captured a key base at Ateq, capital of the  oil-producing province of Shabwa.
The claim by forces loyal to President Ali Abdallah Saleh was "totally  unfounded, the spokesman told television in Aden, capital of the breakaway  state headed by southern leader Ali Salem al-Baid.
A military spokesman in the capital Sanaa told the official Saba news  agency on Sunday that the Ateq base had fallen to government troops.
Northern forces also said they had been in control of another southern  military base at Al-Anad since Friday and had now surrounded the southern  stronghold of Aden.
Ateq lies 130 kilometers (78 miles) east of Aden.
