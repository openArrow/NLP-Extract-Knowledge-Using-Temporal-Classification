The African National Congress (ANC) Wednesday  unveiled a wide-ranging health plan to wipe out the inequalities of apartheid  and bring free medical care to children, the elderly and the pregnant.
The plan was handed to Minister of Health Nkosazana Zuma Wednesday, who  will decide whether or not to adopt it as South Africa's national health  policy, ANC secretary for health Ralph Mgijima said at a press briefing.
It focuses on maternal and child health services, improving nutrition,  controlling infectious diseases and dealing with the effects of violence.
It aims to establish community health centres offering preventive,  rehabilitative and curative services and would also provide casualty and  maternity service 24 hours a day.
As a starting point the plan will streamline into one the 14 separate  health departments created by apartheid.
"Duplication was a major source of expenditure," Mgijima said. "A single  governmental structure will co-ordinate all aspects of both the public and  private health care delivery and all exisiting departments will be  integrated," Mgijima said.
He said the plan had not yet been "costed," but that the ANC health  department envisaged raising spending on health to at least 13 billion rands  (3.6 billion dollars) or 13 percent of government expenditure from 11 percent  last year.
Mgijima said the ANC would also look at increasing taxes on cigarettes and  alcohol, "not merely to raise revenue but also to improve people's health and  thereby reduce the demand on the health services."
He emphasised that it was "entirely up to the minister" to decide what to  do with the plan, and that other political parties were welcome to submit  their own visions for health policy.
The ANC has the majority in South Africa's new government which also  includes the former ruling National Party and the Zulu nationalist Inkatha  Freedom Party.
