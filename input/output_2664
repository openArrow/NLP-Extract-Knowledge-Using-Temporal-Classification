An ASEAN business meeting due to be  held here next week has been postponed because of Indonesian protests over a  conference on East Timor being held in Manila, organizers said here Saturday.
Vicente Paterno, head of the steering committee of the East ASEAN Business  Convention (EABC), said the decison to postpone the meeting was taken Friday  in a telephone conference between representatives of Brunei, Malaysia,  Indonesia and the Philippines.
Business executives from the four countries were scheduled to take part in  the conference scheduled for May 26 to 28, but Indonesian delegates were  earlier this week ordered by Jakarta to withdraw in retaliation for a private  conference on human rights in East Timor being staged in Manila from May 31.
Paterno said the ASEAN conference, which was to be attended by 300 foreign  business executives, would have been "crippled," without the Indonesians who  were due to send about 150 delegates.
