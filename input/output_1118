Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was back in hospital  Monday for routine cancer treatment.
The widow of slain US president John F. Kennedy and Greek shipping magnate  Aristotle Onassis was in good condition, her spokeswoman said.
"She goes in for routine visits, routine treatment," spokeswoman Nancy  Tuckerman said.
Onassis, 64, may be released as early as Tuesday, the New York  Hospital-Cornell Medical Center said.
She revealed in February that she has non-Hodgkins lymphoma. The former  first lady also received surgery for a bleeding ulcer in April.
