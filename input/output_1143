A large collection of anthropomorphic Metal Age  pottery has been discovered in the southern Philippines, with Moslem  guerrillas leading government archeologists to the site, the National Museum  said here Tuesday.
The 300-piece trove, which dates back to between 200 and 400 B.C. and was  discovered inside the Ayub cave near Maitum town in 1992, "reinforces the  theory" that the archipelago became inhabited by humans much earlier than  previously thought, government archeologist Elenita Alba said.
The outstanding pieces of the artifacts, many of them shaped in the human  form, have been transferred to the National Museum while the rest, some of  which have been broken, have remained at the cave, she told AFP.
Alba said nearby residents alerted the museum here about the existence of  the collection, which is located in an area controlled by the Moro National  Liberation Front (MNLF).
"There was some coordination" with the rebels, who guided a team of  government archeologists to the site, she added.
Scientific evaluation has established that the pots were manufactured on  or near the same site, and not brought into the islands by a foreign culture,  Alba said.
Up to the early 1970s, the well-accepted theory had been that the  Philippine archipelago was first populated by three successive waves of sea  migrations, the latest and largest of which was of the Malay race which now  constitute the Filipino stock.
However, this has been challenged by the discovery in 1962 of a skull cap  and part of a human jaw in a cave in the western island of Palawan.
