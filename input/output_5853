The Yemeni interior minister on  Tuesday denied that hundreds of people had been arrested in a crackdown on  dissent by President Ali Abdallah Saleh since the civil war began.
Western diplomats in the Gulf said Monday that members of the southern  Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) trapped in Sanaa had been forced into hiding after  several were killed.
But Interior Minister Yahia al-Mutawakal told the Arabic daily Al-Hayat:  "No leading member of the Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) has been arrested  because he was a member of this party."
He said that only 80 people had been arrested for trying to loot the  offices of the YSP in Sanaa or houses belonging to party members.
