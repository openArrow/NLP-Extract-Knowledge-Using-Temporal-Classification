The currencies moved little on the European foreign  exchange markets early Tuesday, as dealers waited for dealing in New York to   reopen after the long-weekend in Britain and the US.
The dollar remained weak at 1.6415 marks against 1.6440 at the Friday  close.
"The market is waiting to see what US traders will do with Friday's  figures," said Peter Wood, a trader at the Bank of Boston.
On Friday, figures showing US gross domestic product rose three percent in  the first quarter -- up from an initial estimate of 2.6 percent growth --  pushed the dollar above 1.65 marks, but it fell later in profit-taking.
"At the moment, dealers are selling the dollar each time any encouraging  news pushes it up. Unless there is concerted central bank intervention, it  will fall to around 1.62 to 1.63 marks in the next few days," said Wood.
Against the European currencies, the mark took advantage of the dollar's  weakness, rising to 3.42 French francs from 3.4168 on Friday and to 970.15  lire from 967.
The escudo remained weak at 104.07 to the mark against 104.10, while the  drachma, which survived the weekend without a devaluation, rose to 147.90  against the mark from 150.45.
By midmorning, the dollar was trading at 1.6415 marks from 1.6440 at the  Friday close, at 104.58 yen from 104.40, at 1.3990 Swiss francs from 1.4035  and at 5.6163 French francs from 5.6213.
The pound was trading at 1.5095 dollars from 1.5090, at 2.4779 marks from  2.4808, at 157.92 yen from 157.54, at 2.1125 Swiss francs from 2.1179 and at  8.4805 French francs from 8.4825.
In Paris, the greenback and the French franc declined slightly against the  main European currencies in calm trading ahead of a series of US statistics  this week.
By midmorning, the mark was trading at 3.4190 French francs from 3.4170 at  the Monday close. European markets did not close in line with those in Britain  and the US.
The dollar slipped 5.6185 French francs from 5.6280, to 1.6425 marks from   1.6470 and to 104.53 yen from 104.68 yen at the previous close.
Sterling declined to 8.4757 French francs from 8.4922 on Monday.
