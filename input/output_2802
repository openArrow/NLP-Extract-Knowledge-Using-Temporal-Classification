Julio Cesar Vasquez showed a true champion's  resilience and got off the canvas to retain his WBA light-middleweight title  after a bruising contest with Russia's Ahmat Dottouev here Saturday night.
Vasquez, 27, and defending his title for a seventh time, floored a  fast-fading and clearly distressed Dootouev three times after 47 seconds of  round ten to win on the three knockdown rule.
Earlier the South American was on the canvas twice himself as Dottouev  controlled the first-half of the fight with sharp, powerful punching.
At first it looked as if Vasquez might be too strong for a man having only  his 11th professional fight after a glittering amateur career of more than 370  bouts.
Dottouev was wobbled in the final seconds of the opening round, but  immediately stung Vasquez with a hard counter punch.
Dottouev clearly won the second round and he then put Vasquez down with a  big right hand in the third.
Vasquez was up immediately and took the mandatory eight count from referee  John Coyle, and he stepped on the throttle in the sixth and floored the  Russian. But in the same round he too had to take a count.
However, the body shots started to take their toll on Dottouev and from  the seventh the challenger grew more tired and there was not much coming back  in Vasquez's direction.
Referee Coyle had a long, hard look at Dottouev at the end of the ninth,  and the Russian caved in under the relentless pressure in the 10th. But he had  given am excellent account of himself against a man who had won 49 of 50 bouts  -- his only loss coming on a disqualification.
