The United States wants a concrete, credible  trade agreement with Japan, going beyond the failures of the past, US Treasury  Under-Secretary Lawrence Summers said here Wednesday.
"We need a concrete, credible agreement going beyond the failure of the  past," Summers said a day before US and Japanese negotiators meet in  Washington to try to break a three-month deadlock in bilateral trade talks.
Summers said there had not been "any backing away" by the United States in  its position in the negotiations.
