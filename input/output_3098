The far-right Republican party presented a  last-minute presidential candidate Monday as a special federal assembly  gathered here to choose a new German head of state.
This fifth candidate, Hans Hirzel from Baden-Wuerttemberg, has no chance  of being elected against the three main party candidates and an independent.  The Republicans have only eight votes among the 1,324 of the federal assembly.
The favourite to succeed Richard von Weizsaecker is the present  constitutional court chairman Roman Herzog, 60, who is the candidate of the  Christian Union parties led by Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
