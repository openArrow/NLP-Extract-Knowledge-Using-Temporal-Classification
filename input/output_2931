The mostly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF)  Sunday seized the Camp Kanombe barracks near Kigali airport which they had  captured earlier in the day, UN officials announced.
Hundreds of people fled the camp after the rebels took the airport  following days of intense shelling. The barracks accommodated up to 4,000  government troops until recently and were the biggest in the Rwandan capital,  according to a UN estimate.
