Hong Kong cable television broadcaster Wharf  Cable is expected to reach a final agreement with the British Broadcasting  Corp. this week to deliver World Service Television to the territory, Wharf  Cable spokeswoman said Monday.
Gilda Cheung said "we are finalizing the agreement" with the BBC to  introduce World Service Television on the cable station's new channel,  launched Monday.
She said an official announcement would be made later in the week on the  reappearance of World Service Television in Hong Kong and the New Territories.
It was removed from satellite broadcaster Star TV's North Asia network  last month, media magnate Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Ltd. replacing it with  Mandarin language movies for broadcast to China, Taiwan and Hong Kong.
Star TV still carries BBC World Service on its West Asia network.
Wharf Cable, which already carries the US-based Cable News Network, will  reintroduce BBC World Service Television on its new International Channel,  which will offer entertainment, drama and talk shows to the first batch of  60,000 subscribers, mainly in the Kowloon peninsula and the New Territories.
The new channel was the 11th of 20 channels to be beamed throughout the  territory.
