Whitbread leaders Merit Cup and  Brooksfield were under pressure on Friday as the pack targetted the  around-the-world race pace-setters.
Tokio looked the major danger, moving up to fourth in the Whitbread 60  class by 15.32 GMT after covering a near-record 427.6 miles in 24 hours and  averaging 20.7 knots during one six-hour sprint.
Galicia 93 Pescanova and Winston, the second and third W60s on the sixth  leg to Southampton, also averaged 20 knots to stay in contention.
Merit Cup, meanwhile, frittered away 30 miles to big maxi rival New  Zealand Endeavour and downbeat skipper Pierre Fehlman argued worse was to come  because of the changing wind conditions.
"During the next two or three days, our lead is going to melt away and we  can hardly do anything to avoid it," he said.
The major move of the day came from gambling Lawrie Smith and Intrum  Justitia, the yacht moving north and away from the rest of the fleet.
"We are prepared to take some risks to achieve our aim to get well ahead  of Yamaha," said Smith. "For us it is more important to win the race than  protect our current second position."
