Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was released from  hospital here Wednesday after treatment for complications of her cancer.
The 64-year-old widow of slain US president John F. Kennedy and Greek  shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis checked in Monday "as a result of serious  complications of her malignant lymphoma," New York Hospital-Cornell Medical  Center said in a statement.
"While in the hospital, she received further diagnostic evaluation and  treatment."
"In accordance with the patient's clearly expressed wishes and with the  concurrence of her physicians, she has been discharged home," the statement  added.
Onassis revealed in February that she has non-Hodgkins lymphoma. The  former first lady also received surgery for a bleeding ulcer in April.
Onassis was visited Tuesday at her Fifth Avenue apartment in Manhattan by  her brother-in-law, Senator Edward Kennedy, and his wife, Victoria.
"I think all the members of the family are distressed by the medical  reports," Kennedy told reporters after the visit.
"All the members of the family love her very deeply. We wanted her to be  here this evening. She's resting comfortably," he added.
The Senator said Onassis' son, John Kennedy Jr., and daughter, Caroline  Kennedy Schlossberg, were also at the apartment.
