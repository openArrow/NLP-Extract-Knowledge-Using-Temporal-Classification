Canada's annual inflation rate remained at 0.2  percent in April, the third consecutive month at its 33-year low, the  government reported Wednesday.
Statistics Canada said that -- like the previous two months -- the low  inflation rate was due primarily to lower tax on tobacco imposed by the  federal government and some provinces.
Excluding the tobacco tax factor, the annual inflation rate in April would  have been 1.5 percent -- also unchanged from February and March.
"Large price increases in transportation, food, and health and personal  care were partly offset by decreases in the costs of housing, tobacco products  and alcoholic beverages," Statistics Canada said.
