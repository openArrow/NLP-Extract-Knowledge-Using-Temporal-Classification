Disgraced former French and European champions  Olympique Marseille dismissed reports of their demise here on Tuesday.
"Reports of 400 million francs of debts could not be further from the  truth. We have made a spectacular financial recovery with big profits," the  club's financial director Alain Laroche claimed after a league inquiry into  the club's position.
He told the league's financial watchdog, the DNCG, a Canadian mining firm  was ready to put 70 million francs (10 million dollars) on the table and a  further 200 million francs (30 million dollars) next season.
Laroche promised to name the backers as soon as the DNCG announced its  findings. That might come later in the day.
A Marseille commercial court last week ordered an investigation of the  club's accounts after an audit revealed debts of 404 million francs although  the club claimed the net deficit after trading losses was only 67 million  francs.
Marseille have been demoted to the second division for their alleged part  in a match-fixing scandal which clinched their fifth successive league title  last year, just five days before they became the first French club to win the  European Cup.
Bernard Tapie, the club's embattled president who has appealed against his  life ban from football, was not at the hearing. He faces claims for at least  500 million francs from different creditors and is fighting off the bailiffs.
