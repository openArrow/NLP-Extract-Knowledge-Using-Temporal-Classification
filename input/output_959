Ukraine will take part in joint military maneuvres  to be held in Poland this summer under the auspices of NATO's Partnership for  Peace program, Defense Minister Vitaly Radetsky said Monday.
Polish, Hungarian and US troops are to take part in the June and July  exercises with each party contributing a motorized unit and a group of  officers, said Radetsky, cited by Interfax news agency.
He said similar exercises could be held in the future on Ukrainian  territory as two military bases have been set up for such maneuvres in the  Odessa region on the Black Sea and in the Carpathian mountains.
