Australia's consumers are showing record levels of  optimism about the country's economic future, a survey by the  Westpac-Melbourne Institute said Thursday.
The consumer sentiment index shot to its highest level since the poll  began 21 years ago, rising 2.2 points or 1.8 percent to 121.2 points during  May.
"The increase in consumer confidence builds on the strong surge in  confidence over the previous six months," Westpac Banking Corp. chief  economist Bill Evans said, noting that the index was now 35.9 percent above  its September 1993 trough of 89.2 points.
The survey said the record level of confidence resulted from a combination  of high hopes for economic recovery, continued low inflation and signs of  easing unemployment.
