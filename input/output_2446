Nonetheless Graf, who has outrageously dominated the women's game since  last year's stabbing and prolonged convalescence of Monica Seles, will start a  red-hot favourite to win the event for a fourth time when she makes her  eleventh visit.
Before taking the 1993 title, Graf also triumphed in 1987 and 1988 and was  a finalist in 1989, 1990 and 1992.
Japan's Kimiko Date has what should be a tough first-round clash in the  form of South African Amanda Coetzer who won the WTA's Prague event two weeks  ago.
And probably the most explosive first round match in the women's event  will involve twelfth-seeded Canadian-born French hope Mary Pierce and battling  24-year-old Nicole Provis of Australia - a semi-finalist in 1988.
In the bottom-half of the draw, second-seed Arantxa Sanchez, a winner here  in 1989 is scheduled to play Spanish compatriot Conchita Martinez for a place  in the final.
Both look to have relatively comfortable passages until the quarter-finals  where Martinez should come up against fifth-seeded Jana Novotna and Sanchez is  scheduled to play Natlia Zvereva.
