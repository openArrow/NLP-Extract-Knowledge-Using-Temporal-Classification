All the formula one teams agreed to start  practice here Friday for the Spanish Grand Prix after a two-hour meeting with  motor racing chief Max Mosley.
The teams agreed to qualify with cars fitted with the new safety designs  but it appeared they had won concessions for the rest of the season when more  stringent changes were scheduled.
Frank Williams and McLaren managing director Ron Dennis had backed  Benetton chief Flavio Briatore when the Italian's cars failed scrutineering.
However, Briatore later indicated he would race under the new rules when  he told marshalls he accepted responsibility for the Benetton cars' safety.
The new measures, designed to cut engine power and reduce aerodynamic  efficiency, had been rushed in following the deaths of Brazilian Ayrton Senna  and Austrian Roland Ratzenberger at Imola and the Monaco crash which ended  with Karl Wendlinger in a coma.
However, the team chiefs claimed the changes made the cars even more  dangerous because they had not had time to test them properly.
