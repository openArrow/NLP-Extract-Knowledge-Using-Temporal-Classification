A 15-year-old Sudanese girl strangled five small  children in response to what she said a call by Jesus Christ to alleviate  their suffering, police said Sunday.
The girl, identified as H.Z., strangled the children in four incidents,  the official Sudan news agency SUNA reported, quoting Khartoum state's acting  police commissioner, General Izza al-Deen Qandour.
He said the first case reported was the discovery of the body of a  12-year-old with traces of beating on the corpse.
The second case was reported at the begining of April when a citizen  notified police that he has came across the bodies of a four-year-old and a  five-year-old in the Khartoum area.
Then a three-yeaqr-old's body was found.
On May 6, the body of an apparently strangled 11-year-old was found.
Police launched a hunt in which police dogs, fingerprints, and footprint  tracers were combined, and found the girl 48 hours later, the commissioner  said.
The girl confessed, saying that when she killed a child she entered a  state where she did not know what she was doing, and was not able to return to  normality until the victim was dead, and attributing the killings to a call  from Jesus, the commissioner said.
The arrest followed panic in Khartoum as the result of rumours that the  strangulations had been carried out by a gang which kidnapped children in  order to use their blood or organs.
