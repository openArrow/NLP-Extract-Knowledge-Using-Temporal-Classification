Governor Chris Patten defended his government's  decision to ban exiled Chinese dissidents from Hong Kong, saying Monday it was  too "sensitive" for them to come.
"There are just some moments -- you know it as well as I do -- which are  rather more sensitive than others," Patten told reporters on his return from a  week-long trip to Britain.
"None of us want to make difficulties more complex," he added.
Two outspoken Chinese dissidents in the United States, Liu Binyan and Ruan  Ming, revealed last week that the British consulate in New York had denied  them visas to visit Hong Kong on instructions from Patten's administration.
They were to attend a seminar next month to mark the fifth anniversary of  the June 4, 1989 military crushing of the Tiananmen Square democracy movement  in Beijing, which falls on Saturday.
Patten said there was a difference between Hong Kongers' freedom of  expression and the ability of outsiders -- "no matter how distinguised or  eloquent" -- to come to the territory and speak out.
"We do need to be restrained from time to time in the way we say things,"  he added.
