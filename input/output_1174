Social democrat Jose Francisco Pena Gomez  took a slight lead over incumbent President Joaquin Balaguer, but complained  of "blatant fraud" in Monday's general elections.
After 1.84 percent of the vote was tallied early Tuesday, the Central  Election Committee announced that Pena Gomez, 57, was ahead with 17,902 votes  against 16,674 for 87-year-old Balaguer.
Balaguer was seeking his seventh presidential mandate, having ruled the  country for most of the time since the assassination of dictator Rafael  Trujillo in 1961.
Former president Juan Bosh, 81, of the Dominican Liberation Party, was in  third place with 5,617 votes, the committee added.
An hour before the vote count was given, Pena Gomez claimed at a press  conference that the election committee had tampered with voter lists sent to  the interior of the country, robbing his party of "thousands" of votes and  preventing his followers from casting their ballots.
Gomez accused the committee of "blatant fraud" and said that the 200,000  inhabitants of San Cristobal, 30 kilometers (19 miles) south of here, were  under a virtual state of siege.
The first presidential candidate of Haitian origin, however, admitted  being ahead in the preliminary vote count.
To compensate for irregularities, the Central Election Committee extended  voting by an additional four hours until 10:20 p.m. Monday.
An estimated 3.3 million Dominicans voted Monday for a president, vice  president, 30 senators, 120 deputies and 107 mayors.
