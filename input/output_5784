An Iraqi Shiite Moslem opposition group said here  Tuesday that the sacking of the prime minister would not save President Saddam  Hussein from economic and political collapse.
The Tehran-based Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq  (SAIRI) said the change of government was "evidence of deepening internal  crisis in Iraq and Saddam's growing uncertainty about his future."
"But this ruinous effort will not save Saddam and his regime from the  domestic and international impasse," it said.
SAIRI warned that the move would not produce "any positive changes in Iraq  because the main culprits of the political and economic crisis still remain in  power."
Saddam sacked Prime Minister Ahmad al-Khodair on Sunday and took over  himself to tackle the country's economic ills after almost four years of UN  embargo because of its invasion of Kuwait.
