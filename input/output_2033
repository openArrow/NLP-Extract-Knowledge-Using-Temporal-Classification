Teenage tennis star Jennifer Capriati  voluntarily entered a drug rehabilitation center in the Miami area Wednesday,  two days after her arrest on drugs charges, her agent said.
Capriati's agent, Barbara Perry, told USA Today that her parents visited  her Wednesday and "everything's fine, she's in good spirits," the newspaper  reported Thursday
Capriati, 18, was arrested Monday in a motel room in Coral Gables,  Florida, on a misdemeanor drug possession charge. She had checked into the  room Saturday, the motel manager said.
Edward Abramson, lawyer for one of two people arrested with Capriati, told  a US news agency Wednesday that he was told "Capriati rented the room, used  her credit card to pay for the intoxicants. There was a party" and Capriati  was "whacked out on heroin." He would not disclose the source of his  information.
Abramson represents Tom Wineland, 20, who was arrested with Capriati on a  charge of possession of suspected crack cocaine and drug paraphernalia.
Timineet Branagan, a 17-year-old runaway girl, was charged with possession  of heroin.
Police said they had no evidence Capriati used cocaine or heroin.  Capriati's attorney and agent have called a news conference Thursday.
Capriati's arrest reportedly has cost her one of her oldest and most  lucrative endorsement contracts and has jeopardized another, according to The  New York Times Thursday.
The Times quoted Perry as saying Wednesday that racket manufacturer Prince  had ended its contract and Diadora, the Italian sportswear line, was  discussing termination of its deal.
Both companies had signed multimillion-dollar contracts with Capriati  before she turned pro at age 13 in 1990.
Capriati has not played tournament tennis since losing in the first round  of the US Open last year complaining that she needed a break to concentrate on  her schooling.
She moved out of her parents home in Tampa, Florida in March and has been  staying here since then.
