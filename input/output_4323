South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo and  Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe on Thursday discussed the future of five  South Africans serving life jail terms for spying for the former apartheid  regime.
Nzo, on his first visit to Zimbabwe since South Africa's all-race  government came to power earlier this month, said he had discussed the  delicate issue with Mugabe, but refused to give details.
The five -- Kevin Woods, Michael Smith, Phillip Conjwayo, Denis Beahan and  Barry Bawden -- were convicted of involvement in acts of spying and sabotage  on African National Congress targets in Zimbabwe during the 1980s.
The first three were intially sentenced to death for killing a man during  a raid, but had their sentences commuted to life early this year.
In a report published Thursday, the Zimbawe Human Rights Organisations  warned the authorities to be cautious in their negotiations with Pretoria on  the agents.
"If political considerations are allowed to give way to basic tenets of  human rights protection, then we will have a situation whereby crimes will be  committed with impunity," the organization's secertary-general Ozias  Tungwarara said.
Zimbabwe Justice Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa said in February after talks  with his counterpart from South Africa's former white minority government,  Kobie Coetsee, that the convincted men would be released "at the appropriate  time."
Nzo told reporters after his meeting with Mugabe: "We are going to make  certain that the relations are strengthened because we are convinced that this  will be in the interest of our peoples."
Mugabe said: "We are all overjoyed by the changes and transformation (in  South Africa) and we can now relate to South Africa as openly as we always  desired to do."
