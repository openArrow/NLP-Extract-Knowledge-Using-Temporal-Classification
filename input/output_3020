Jackie Joyner-Kersee won the women's long jump at  the New York Games athletics meeting Sunday with a leap of 7.49m, the  second-longest in history.
The American, a two-time world champion in both long jump and heptathlon,  said she had been concentrating in training with her husband and coach Bob  Kersee on long jump and hurdles.
Her leap was just three centimeters short of the world record of 7.52, set  by Galina Chistyakova of Russia in 1988.
"I was concentrating on getting the boards," she said. "On the first jump,  I over-accelerated.
"The second (7m), didn't feel that good. On the third jump I was thinking  about what Bob said about accelerating past my second mark and holding on my  extension. I didn't think it was a great jump, I was just glad I was on the  board."
Carl Lewis won the men's long jump, his first competition in the event  since he won the long jump gold medal at the Barcelona Olympics.
Lewis leapt 8.45m, despite some problems with his approach.
"My run was terrible today, but I felt my jumping was more consistent," he  said. "It wasn't as strange as I thought. I wasn't as nervous and anxious as I  thought I'd be. I can correct the run pretty quickly and I know I'm in a great  shape.
"My goal is to be ready and perform at my top level in every meet I enter  this year in not only the long jump but in the 100 and 200 also."
The meet was the second event of the 1994 IAAF Grand Prix. The season  opening meet in Sao Paulo, Brazil, was on Saturday.
Kevin Young, the 400m hurdles world champion, settled for second, five  hundredths of a second behind fellow American Torrance Zellner who clocked  49.65.
"At the finish line I should have given that last second lean, but I  didn't and it cost me the race," Young said.
