Battling Arantxa Sanchez took another step towards  recapturing the French Open title she won as a 17-year-old in 1989, when she  outplayed Germany's Anke Huber 6-3, 6-2 on the Roland Garros centre-court here  on Sunday.
With nine of the 16 seeds already blown away and the women's draw filled  with unfamiliar new names, Sanchez was clearly determined that she was not  going to be the latest big name to join the also-rans.
She went about her business with ferocious efficiency and never allowed  the 24-year-old German the time to settle into her baseline game.
Sanchez, seeded two and one of only two players to beat world number-one  Steffi Graf in the last twelve months thanks to her victory in the Hamburg  final, is clearly delighted with her game on her favourite surface.
But the bustling 22-year-old from Barcelona, who has yet to drop a set and  who has conceded only 17 games since launching her eighth campaign for the  supreme clay court title last Mondat, is counting no chickens.
"I take it one match at a time," she said. "Anything can happen. But I'm  pleased with the way I am playing and I am confident."
Sanchez, who has had three tournament wins in 1994 and who was runner-up  to Graf at the Australian Open and at Delray Beach, now faces either  seventh-seed Natalia Zvereva of the Ukraine or France's Julie Halard for a  place in next week's semi-finals.
