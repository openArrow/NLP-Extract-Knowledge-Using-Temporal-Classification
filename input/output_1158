Stonemason Tom Fearn faces one of rugby  union's toughest challenges here Wednesday night when lowly Western Australia  clash with Ireland in the tourists' opening match of their eight-game  programme.
Fearn, a veteran of 34, has the dubious honour of taking on one of the  world's top fly halfs, 25-year-old dynamo Eric Elwood, a former Gaelic  footballer who now plays for the Lansdowne club.
Since he made his senior international debut against Wales 14 months ago,  he has appeared in seven Tests, scoring in all for a tally of 87 points.
Fearn has been recalled to the State's fly half role after being  unavailable for Western Australia's recent game with Natal.
Undaunted by the magnitude of his task, Fearn said he was delighted to  have the chance of taking on the Irish champion.
"It promises to be the game of a lifetime for me," said the man who began  his playing days in Wanganui, New Zealand, where he is still regarded as the  best full-back the province has seen.
He played 53 games for Wanganui and spent two years as a player in Italy   before moving to Western Australia six years ago.
Western Australian coach Tom Browne, the man who once coached leading  English side, Coventry, said Fearn had been brought back because he had "a  more experienced head" and gave the side a few more options.
The State side is:
Ricky Smith; Greg Hamilton, David Hamilton, Steve Bunce, Darryn Dunbar;  Tom Fearn, Mike Ryburn; Joe Tepania, Peter Roberts, Glen Thompson, Trefor  Thomas, Steve Vitali, Reg Walters, John O'Callaghan, Dirk Gleghorn.
