The United States will challenge a GATT ruling  against US embargoes of tuna imports on the grounds that the GATT panel did  not carry out a fair hearing, the US Trade Representative said Monday.
"The United States will challenge the dispute-settlement panel's failure  to provide a fair hearing and due process and will ask for a full review of  the report," the office of the US Trade Representative said in a statement.
A General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) panel ruled Friday that US  embargoes on tuna imports on environmental grounds were inconsistent with US  obligations under the GATT.
The US had banned some imports of tuna caught using nets which endanger  dolphins.
US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said "the panel's report reinforces  our commitment to full transparency in this and future proceedings."
"We consider it absolutely essential that arguments in this case be fully  and openly considered," Kantor said.
"We will ask that the case be reheard before a panel before which  non-governmental organizations can make presentations and hear arguments and  that all documents related to the case be made public before the hearing," he  said.
The complaint to GATT was brought by the European Union (EU) and the  Netherlands. Kantor said that damage to EU interests from the tuna embargoes  came to less than a million dollars.
Kantor said that the GATT panel report had no effect on the US law on tuna  imports to protect dolphins and that it would be up to Congress to take what  ever legislative action it thought appropriate.
Kantor said the panel had not made enough effort to take environmental  considerations into account. He noted that the EU also used trade measures in  pursuit of environmental objectives in some cases.
"Protecting the environment is an area in which we should have common  interests and we should work to achieve common goals," Kantor said.
