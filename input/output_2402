Ireland take on New South Wales here Sunday with  four test places to be resolved for the opening international against the  world champion Australian Wallabies early next month, Ireland coach Gerry  Murphy said Friday.
The Irish will field their strongest line-up against NSW, who Murphy  regards as international strength.
Sunday's team contains five uncapped players -- centre John Bell, winger  Niall Woods, No.8 Roger Wilson, second rower Gabriel Fulcher and prop Phil  Soden.
Woods and Soden will have the opportunity to force their test claims at  the expense of prop Nick Popplewell and winger Richard Wallace, who were unfit  to tour.
"There are eight current internationals. Gary Halpin has played seven  Tests and Jim Staples 14, so that is 10 internationals," said Murphy.
"The rest have played A internationals. Now is the time to see whether  they can do it.
"I would say there are three or maybe four positions that are certainly  open.
"We had our best eight forwards on the pitch in the Five Nations  championships, but perhaps not always in the right position, so that's  something we have to sort out.
"Nick Popplewell is one and Richard Wallace is another so there are  certain areas that we are looking at."
Following Sunday's encounter, Ireland will have three more fixtures --  against Australian Capital Territory, Super Ten champions Queensland and an  Australian XV -- to finalise their team before the first Test in Brisbane on  June 5.
