The US and South Korean presidents agreed Tuesday  that their two countries must close ranks to cope with North Korea's nuclear  standoff, which had reached a "very dangerous point," a government spokesman  said.
"The two presidents agreed the North Korean nuclear issue has reached a  very dangerous point and that it is very important for the US and South Korea  to cooperate closely to face it squarely," spokesman Chu Don-Shik said.
He was referring to a 20 minute phone conversation between South Korean  Preident Kim Young-Sam and US President Bill Clinton which came a few hours  before the UN Security Council issued a statement urging Pyongyang to end its  nuclear brinkmanship.
Clinton told Kim that although the UN statement stopped short of  mentioning sanctions, it was significant in that it urged the North to abide  by its obligations related to nuclear safeguards for a negotiated settlement.
Yonhap news agency meanwhile quoted an unidentified government official as  saying that South Korea would push for sanctions aganst North Korea outside  the United Nations if China used veto rights in favor of the North.
Kim said he agreed with the UN Security Council's move to exhaust peaceful  means to resolve the issue before shifting to sanctions, but added: "If these  (dialogue) efforts turn out to be fruitless, sanctions against the North would  be unavoidable."
Kim said China would feel its position weakened this time because it had  campaigned for the UN Security Council to issue a mild statement against the  North in April.
North Korea blocked International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors  from taking samples of spent fuel from a five-megawatt nuclear reactor in  Yongbyon, which was needed to determine if plutonium had been diverted for  weapons.
Pyongyang has called for a "package deal," which includes diplomatic  recognition of the North by the United States and a halt to the US-South Korea  Team Spirit military exercise in exchange for its allowance of full nuclear  inspections.
