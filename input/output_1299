The leader of the Islamic community in  Bosnia-Hercegovina, Mustafa Ceric, has refused to meet Patriarch Aleksy II of  the Russian Orthodox church, the Bosnian embassy said here on Tuesday.
The patriarch, as part of his peace efforts in Bosnia, had proposed a  meeting in his presence between the Moslem leader, the Patriarch of the  Serbian Orthodox Church Pavle and Cardinal Franjo Kuharic, primate of the  Croatian Catholic Church.
The meeting had been scheduled for Tuesday afternoon at Sarajevo airport,  the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported.
The Bosnian Moslem leader, who lives in Sarajevo, "refused the invitation  because he does not want to meet the head of a church which supports (Serb)  aggression," Neven Kulenovic, advisor at the Zagreb embassy, told AFP.
Cardinal Kuharic, for his part, accepted the invitation and journalists at  the airport said he left Zagreb for Sarajevo on Tuesday morning.
