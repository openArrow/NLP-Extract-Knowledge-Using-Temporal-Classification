Volkswagen (VW) announced a sharp  improvement in its overall performance, reporting a net loss for the first  quarter of 342 million German marks (206 million dollars) on Thursday.
This was despite continuing severe problems in the Seat subsidiary and  compared with a loss of 1.247 billion marks in the first three quarters of  last year.
VW had forecast in March that the performance for the first quarter would  show a loss of 400 million marks.
In an interim report on Thursday the company said that results had  improved by 72.6 percent during the 12 months to the end of the quarter. There  was a "good chance" of an improvement in the results by the parent company  Volkswagen AG and of the group returning to a break-even point.
This would be achieved "mainly owing to a programme to optimise cost  structures."
The company is embroiled in a bitter dispute with General Motors (GM) over  its recruitment in March 1993 of the man credited with reducing GM's costs,  purchasing and production expert Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, analysts  recalled.
GM has alleged that he had removed confidential documents. VW said shortly  after he joined VW as its difficulties mounted, that Lopez was vital to the  company's prospects. VW and Lopez have denied the allegations.
In the whole of 1993 the company had made a net loss of 1.94 billion marks  and the parent company a net profit of 71 million marks.
The group said that foreign sales had risen particularly strongly, by 12.9  percent to 11.9 billion marks but that sales within Germany had fallen by 9.4  percent to 8.2 billion marks.
Improvement in demand for cars on the biggest markets had not compensated  for problems at the Spanish subsidiary Seat "which represents an enormous  cost."
But the Volkswagen range had made a profit of 35 million marks in the  first quarter compared to a loss of 917 million marks in the first three  quarters of last year.
Overall output had risen by 4.8 percent to 759,441 vehicles in the first  quarter from 724,949 vehicles.
Of the total, Volkswagen cars accounted for 541,072 representing an  increase of 0.6 percent, Audi 80,000 for an increase of 6.2 percent, Seat  78,849 which was an increase of 44 percent and Skoda 58,720 for an increase of  4.1 percent.
Demand in Britain, France and Spain had risen, but in Italy it had fallen  sharply.
From January to March deliveries of Volkswagen models to the US market had  "more than doubled" to 23,669 vehicles from the figure a year ago and  deliveries of Audi models had risen by 78.3 percetn to 27,206 vehicles.
