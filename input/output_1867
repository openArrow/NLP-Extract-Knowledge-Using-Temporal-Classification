Mark Taylor, 29, has been appointed Australian  cricket captain to replace Allan Border, the Australian Cricket Board  announced here Thursday.
"Obviously I am very excited and very proud. It is a day I will never  forget," said Taylor.
"When finally I got the phone call it was a relief that I had got the job.  I would have been very disappointed to miss out because I wanted the job. I  think every Australian wants the job."
Taylor, from New South Wales, has played 54 Tests.
He said he was informed of the decision by board spokesman Ian McDonald by  phone late Wednesday.
Queenslander Ian Healy was appointed vice-captain.
Taylor, whose appointment followed Border's resignation on May 11, will  lead the Australian team to Sri Lanka and Pakistan in September.
