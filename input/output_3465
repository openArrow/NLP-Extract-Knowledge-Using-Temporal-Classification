That's not easy given Andretti's history of frustration at this famed  speedway. Andretti's only triumph here came in 1969.
"I've never been at war with the speedway, so there's no peace to make,"  he said. "I've led a lot of laps here, just not the right ones. When I reflect  on it, I couldn't control it. The effort was there. Fate wasn't with me."
Equipment failures have ended his race here 11 times. Six other 500s ended  with crashes, the most infamous being in 1982 when a crash as the race began  wiped him out of contention.
"You look back and there are disappointments," he said. "They are when you  fall out and you had speed. You will never know what the outcome could have  been. When it doesn't work out, you have to keep going. What doesn't work  today might work tomorrow. Thats what keeps you going on."
Andretti finished second twice.
In 1985, Danny Sullivan spun and recovered to beat Andretti. In 1981,  Andretti started 32nd and was awarded victory hours after the race ended when  officials gave Bobby Unser a one-lap penalty.
Unser went to court, won an appeal and regained the victory when the  penalty was revoked in a decision that still bothers Mario.
"That was a farce," he said. "I didn't like the way it was handled. They  decided the penalty was too severe. In a sense, I couldn't accept that."
"As time went on, the '69 win became more valuable. At least I got that.  Thank God, or else my career would be considered incomplete. In some way, the  monkey is off my back," he said.
Andretti said the one race he wanted most but never won was Le Mans, then  hinted he might be tempted back behind the wheel there.
"I would love to have put that one on the mantle," he said. "My best  finish was third. Maybe I can leave the door open on that a little. I would  like to try that a couple of times."
