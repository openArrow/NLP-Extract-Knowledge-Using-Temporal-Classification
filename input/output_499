Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic denounced  Saturday as "unacceptable" western calls for a four-month ceasefire throughout  Bosnia.
"We think that is too long. (A) two month (ceasefire) would suffice to  find a political solution," Izetbegovic told journalists here.
He added that Bosnian insistence on a "temporary ceasefire means we retain  the military option at our disposal if political negotiations fail."
The call for a four-month truce was issued Friday by foreign ministers of  the United States, Russia and several European countries.
