Three hundred Palestinian  policemen crossed into the West Bank from Jordan overnight and headed by bus  for the Gaza Strip under Israeli army escort, a military spokesman said Friday.
The men from the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) will join 300 of their  comrades who arrived in two groups on Tuesday and Wednesday nights through the  Rafah border from Egypt.
"They crossed the Allenby Bridge early this morning and will probably  enter Gaza from the south," the spokesman said.
They belong to the PLA's "Badr" brigade stationed in Jordan and were  driving down the Dead Sea, up through the Negev desert and across west to the  Strip.
The men were armed but without munitions, which were held only by one  officer on each of the 10 buses.
Meanwhile, in Jericho the Israelis handed over five buildings to 60  Palestinian officers in the early hours of Friday as a small crowd of  residents who had stayed up all night cheered on.
Another 386 policemen, formerly based in Iraq, were due to follow later   Friday, as the Israelis relinquish control of the West Bank town and the Gaza  Strip to the Palestinians under the autonomy deal signed on May 4.
And 300 more Palestinian police had been stuck all night at the Rafah  border because of what PLO officials described as "a big problem", but refused  to elaborate.
Palestinian sources said the Israeli authorities objected to certain names  among the 300 and that a major argument ensued.
Israeli security forces have handed over control of all the south of the  Gaza Strip to the fledgling police force, except for the Jewish settlements  which remain under army protection. Security installations were given to the  Palestinians at Khan Yunes in the night, the army spokesman said.
Facilities in Gaza City were scheduled to be handed over on Sunday.
The Palestinian police is due to have 9,000 men, 7,000 of them from PLA  units scattered across the Arab world.
