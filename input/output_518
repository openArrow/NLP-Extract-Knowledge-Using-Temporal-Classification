About 100 employees of fugitive real  estate promoter Juergen Schneider have turned themselves in to Germany's  income tax department in a bid to avoid penalties and court cases, Bild am  Sonntag reports in its edition due to appear Sunday.
Frankfurt prosecutor Hildegard Becker-Toussaint said the employees had  been turning themselves in all over the country since Schneider disappeared in  early April owing some five billion German marks (three billion dollars) to  dozens of creditor institutions.
The newspaper said employees of Schneider's firms had received undeclared  cheques and cash on top of their salaries.
The Frankfurt prosecutor's office has prepared prosecutions.
