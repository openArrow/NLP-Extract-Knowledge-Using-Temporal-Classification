China is to launch a nationwide campaign in July  to crack down on the burgeoning trade in fake police uniforms and insignia,  used by criminals posing as officers in fraud scams, the China Daily said  Monday.
According to a public security ministry circular issued recently to  nationwide branches, all illegal producers and traders of such goods will be  punished, while those using them to defraud people in the name of the police  will face severe penalties, the report said.
More than 58,000 sets of police uniforms, 7,230 caps, 6,500 insignia and  30,000 sets of uniform markings have been confiscated in previous campaigns  carried out only at a local level, it said.
Local governments have closed 96 illegal factories and 2,200 stalls  selling fake police goods, it said, condemning the practice as damaging to the  reputation of public security officers.
