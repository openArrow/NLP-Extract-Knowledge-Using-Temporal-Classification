India Thursday offered rewards for information  leading to the arrest of an alleged underworld leader and 43 other suspects in  Bombay bomb blasts last year.
The Central Bureau of Investigation put a prize of 50,000 dollars on  Dawood Ibrahim, who allegedly controls a criminal empire in the western Indian  city from an unknown safe haven abroad.
The same prize was offered for the arrest of Abdul Razak "Tiger" Memon,  his suspected associate in the chain of bomb blasts which killed more than 300  people in Bombay in March last year.
Rewards declared for the arrest of the other suspects range between 25,000  rupees (833 dollars) and one million rupees (33,333 dollars).
Ibrahim and the 43 others, mainly Moslem members of the Bombay underworld,  have been declared fugitives, the bureau said.
According to the agency, Ibrahim sent arms and explosives by sea to the  Indian west coast where one of his accomplices secured a safe landing with the  help of unnamed custom officials.
The transportation of the arms and explosives, their storage in safe  houses in and around Bombay and the blasts were handled by Memon and his  brothers, it said.
The blasts rocked prominent commercial landmarks including the Bombay  Stock Exchange and Air India headquarters, killing 317 people and injuring  nearly 1,000, in the world's worst urban terrorist attack.
Investigators allege the March 1993 explosions were masterminded by  Ibrahim in vengeance for attacks on Moslems by Hindu militants during communal  riots that raged in Bombay in the preceding December and January.
The riots erupted following the destruction of the Babri mosque in the  northern town of Ayodhya by Hindu zealots on December 6, 1992.
