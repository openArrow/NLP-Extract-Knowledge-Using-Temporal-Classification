South African Ernie Els lost some of  his edge but was still sharp enough to take a three-stroke lead into the final  round of the Volvo PGA championship here on Monday.
Els today added a 71 to his two scorching opening rounds of 66 for a 13  under par aggregate of 203 in his bid to lead from start-to-finish as he did  in the Dubai Desert Classic in January.
Defending champion Bernhard Langer shot a 67 and Masters champion Jose  Maria Olazabal a 71 to share second place with another Spaniard, Miguel Angel  Jimenez (72).
They would have trailed Els by only one stroke but for his two closing  birdies.
The Johannesburg golfer, blessed with both power and touch, sank a 30-foot  putt on the 17th and then played a superb pitch-and-run to within two feet of  the pin at the last after driving into sand.
Joint fifth are New Zealander Frank Nobilo, Ryder Cup Swede Joakim  Haeggman and 30-year-old Scot Adam Hunter.
Seve Ballesteros is one stroke further back following a 70, and by  shooting the same score Nick Faldo was left nine strokes off the pace and  seemingly out of the hunt for a record fifth win here.
Langer said Els had the temperament and natural skills to make it to the  top.
"He has a very good build for a golfer and great rhythm. He has a good  head on his shoulders and he does not seem to get upset like some others,"  said Langer.
Thirty-year-old Jimenez, with only one tour title to his name, caught Els  with a birdie at the seventh and then an eagle at the 12th, but fell back  again with bogeys at the 13th and 15th.
