US Secretary of State Warren Christopher arrived  here Sunday at the start of his second shuttle mission in a fortnight between  arch-foes Syria and Israel.
Christopher was greeted at the airport by Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq  al-Shara who immediately accompanied him to the presidential palace for talks  with President Hafez al-Assad.
The secretary of state is expected to deliver a reply to Syrian  counter-proposals since an Israeli offer of a phased withdrawal from the  strategic Golan Heights.
He will fly to Israel on Monday and US embassy sources here expect  Christopher to return to Damascus before leaving the region on Thursday.
The official press reiterated Sunday that Syria insisted on a full Israeli  withdrawal from the heights. A total withdrawal was a condition for  negotiating with Israel on an "acceptable and reasonable" timeframe, Tishrin  said.
In Jerusalem, a senior Israeli official said Christopher would try to  persuade Syria to set up a joint military commission with Israel that would  draft "security arrangements" for the Golan.
The heights, which Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed  in 1981, has been the cornerstone of the dispute between Israel and Syria.
In early May, Israel proposed to return three of five Druze villages on  the heights as a first stage in a three-step withdrawal over a period of five  to eight years.
The United States, as chief sponsor of the Middle East peace process, has  focused on narrowing the gap between the arch-enemies, following the signing  of the May 4 Israeli-PLO accord on the launch of Palestinian self-rule.
