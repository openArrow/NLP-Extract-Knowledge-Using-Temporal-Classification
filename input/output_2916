Zambian President Fredrick Chiluba Sunday  praised defeated Malawian president Hastings Kamuzu Banda for facilitating a  smooth transition from a single to multi-party system of government.
In a statement released to state radio by Malawi's foreign ministry,  Chiluba commended Banda for leaving office "in an orderly manner" and thanked  him for being leader of impoverished Malawi for the past 31 years.
"Africa will remain thankful to Banda. The continent will benefit from  Banda's wisdom and experience," Chiluba is quoted as saying.
Banda, who ruled this tiny south-eastern Africa state since independence  from Britain in 1964 with an iron hand, conceded defeat Wednesday to Bakili  Muluzi, before vote counting in Malawi's first democratic elections was  completed.
Western neighbouring Zambia, which hosted thousands of Malawian exiles  fleeing Banda's oppressive regime, sent a delegation led by labour minister,  Newstead Zimba to the inauguration ceremony Saturday of Muluzi and Vice  President Justin Malewezi.
