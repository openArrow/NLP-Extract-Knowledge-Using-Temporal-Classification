Former Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega was  re-elected secretary general of the Sandinista National Liberation Party  Monday at a convention that exposed rifts in the leftist opposition party.
Ortega, president from 1984-1990, easily survived a challenge from  reformers led by Henry Ruiz and former vice president Sergio Ramirez, who  urged that the party abandon revolutionary dogma and become more democratic.
Ortega defeated Ruiz in the race for party secretary general and the  former president's so-called traditionalist wing also walked away with 11  seats in the 15-member national directorate.
The reformists hold four seats on the directorate, but Ramirez was  defeated in his bid for one of the leadership slots.
Ramirez had warned that the party would be defeated in the 1996 general  elections if it held to the revolutionary dogma of the past.
Ortega lost the Nicaraguan presidency to Violetta Chamorro in 1990   elections in a stunning reversal for the Sandinista party, which came to power  in 1979 after the fall of the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza.
However, Ortega appears firmly in control of the group, commanding 60  percent of the Sandinista Assembly as well as the overwhelming majority of the  directorate.
Tomas Borge, leader of the party's most hard-line faction, was elected  vice secretary but was rebuffed in a bid to be elected president, a post that  had been created specifically for him.
