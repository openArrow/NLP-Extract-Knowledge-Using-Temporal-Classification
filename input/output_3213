In Indianapolis, where qualifying for the Indianapolis 500 was completed  on Sunday, a spokesman for the Newman-Haas team reacted angrily to the reports.
"I don't really care what's in the British papers," said team spokesman  Michael Knight.
"As far as Newman-Haas is concerned, we're trying to win the most  important race of the season this weekend, and that is all we're worrying  about."
Mansell qualified his Cosworth-powered Lola on the third row of the grid  for the May 29 race.
