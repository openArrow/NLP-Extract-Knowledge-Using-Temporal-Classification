Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) chairman  Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres announced here early  Thursday they had agreed on an agenda for the next round of talks about the  occupied territories.
Peres emerged from one hour of talks with Arafat to tell a news  conference: "An agenda was actually agreed upon, namely that we are going to  negotiate the early empowerment some time in the future."
By "early empowerment," he meant the application of Palestinian autonomy  in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, from which the Israeli  army finished its withdrawal overnight Tuesday.
Those talks would probably take place in Cairo, Peres said, adding:  "Basically we feel that the withdrawal went on very well, better than all of  us feel and it was received with enthusiasm."
Further negotiations about the extension of Palestinian autonomy to the  rest of the occupied West Bank would be held in Washington at a date still to  be arranged, he said.
"The extension of the autonomy talks should be in Washington and this  depends very much upon other Arab countries coming in," he said.
Arafat said the talks had been "very important and fruitful discussion ...  through which we discussed very important items concerning the new situation  after the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area, and the next  step, and the coordination between both of us in all fields."
He confirmed that they had also talked about the rest of the West Bank,  negotiations that would require the participation of other Arab countries.
