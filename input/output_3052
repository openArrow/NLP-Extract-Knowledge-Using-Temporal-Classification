President Kim Young-Sam on Monday appointed Park  Kun-Woo, secretary general of the World Cup 2002 bidding committee, as vice  foreign minister in a reshuffle of seven deputy ministers.
Other ministries affected in the mini-reshuffle were finance, economic  planning, agriculture, industry and political affairs.
Presidential spokesman Choo Don-Shik said outgoing deputy Foreign Minister  Hong Soon-Yong was dropped because of "policy confusion" in the ministry. He  did not elaborate.
He said all seven changes would be confirmed by letters of appointment  later Monday.
