Iran has protested to Tokyo over the cremation of  an Iranian who allegedly committed suicide in Japan, saying it was against  Islamic law, the official IRNA news agency said.
The Iranian embassy in Tokyo lodged the protest in a letter to the  Japanese foreign ministry, it said.
A Japanese municipality said it ordered the cremation of the body "because  of the hot weather and since it could not determine the victim's identity,"  according to IRNA.
The embassy, however, said the body had been identified four days after it  was discovered and demanded that the foreign ministry open an investigation  into the case.
The body of the Iranian, who apparently committed suicide, was discovered  on May 1, IRNA said.
Thousands of Iranians work in Japan.
