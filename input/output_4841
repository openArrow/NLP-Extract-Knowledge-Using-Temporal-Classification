Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou late Friday  pledged to pursue diplomatic efforts to resolve a row with Albania but warned  that his government was also prepared to take other measures.
Greece has accused Albania of launching a new campaign to persecute its  Greek minority, which is estimated by Athens to number 400,000 and 60,000 by  Albanian authorities.
Conservative opposition leader Miltiade Evert on Thursday said the issue  could lead to clashes on the Albanian-Greek border.
But Papandreou insisted that his government had decided to respond  "through political and diplomatic means."
"It is clear that (Albanian President Sali) Berisha is provoking Greece on  a near daily basis by the way in which he treats the Greeks in Albania," he  told a private television station.
"Our policy toward Albania is a policy of open doors. We want good  relations with Albania, but on condition, of course, that it does not abuse  the rights of the Greeks there. We are very very firm on this point."
He disclosed that Greece had informed the European Union and members of  the United Nations Security Council -- notably Russia and the United States --  that Athens would take other measures "if Berisha carries on with his absurd  tactics."
Papandreou also pledged to maintain a Greek trade embargo -- widely  criticized by his European partners -- on Macedonia as long as the former  Yugoslav republic refused to change its name, flag and constitution.
Greece insists that Macedonia harbors territorial designs on a northern  Greek province of the same name.
