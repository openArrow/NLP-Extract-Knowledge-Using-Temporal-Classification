The Princess of Wales helped save the life of a  drowning tramp in a dramatic rescue in London's Regent's Park, the Daily Mail  said Thursday.
The incident happened late Sunday after Princess Diana had been jogging  and was being driven home by her chauffeur, when a tourist leapt out and  shouted: "Quick, there's a man in the water."
Diana jumped out of her car and told the chauffeur to call for help on her  mobile phone.
She then ran on to a bridge from where she saw a man later named as Martin  O'Donoghue lying face down in water 10 feet deep.
Diana was joined by other people including Finnish student Karl Kotila,  29, who is living in Tooting, south London.
He plunged into the water, and pulled O'Donoghue to the water's edge,  where Diana helped him onto the bank.
Kotila then administered mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and a heart massage.
Inspector Ronald Cook, of the Royal Park Constabulary, said: "There was no  sign of breathing. He was dead, so you could say he was brought back from the  dead."
The Princess remained throughout the drama and she thanked Kotila for his  quick action.
Police confirmed that they are recommending Kotila for a bravery award.
The Princess has asked doctors to keep her fully informed of O'Donoghue's  condition and has twice visited him in hospital, said the Daily Mail.
A spokesman for University College Hospital tonight said O'Donoghue was in  an intensive care ward and in a "critical but stable" condition.
O'Dongohue, known on the streets as Mick O'Brien, is an Irishman who,  according to friends has been on the streets of London for 20 years and is  often seen begging.
