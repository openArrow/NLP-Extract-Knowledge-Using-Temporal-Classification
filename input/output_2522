Edward, known as Ted or Teddy, was the heir apparent to the Kennedy  political fortunes and was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1962. But seven years  later, in an incident that shattered the family and his national political  aspirations, he drove a car off a bridge on Massachusetts' Chappaquiddick  Island after a party, killing aide Mary Jo Kopechne.
Kennedy won re-election to the Senate. But it was not until 1980 that he  was again being mentioned as presidential material, and he made a late,  unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination against President Jimmy Carter.
He never ran again.
Kennedy and Virginia Joan Bennett were married in 1958 and divorced in  1982. She made headlines intermittently because of a drinking problem. They  had three children, Kara, Edward Jr. and Patrick.
In 1973, Edward Jr.'s right leg had to be amputated because of cancer.
Patrick has been elected state representative from Rhode Island and is a  candidate for Congress.
Sen. Kennedy's reputation was further damaged when he and his son Patrick  were with his nephew William Kennedy Smith in 1991 when Smith was accused of  committing a rape at the family's Palm Beach, Fla., estate. Smith was  acquitted.
Ted Kennedy married Victoria Reggie in 1992 and is again running for the  Senate.
