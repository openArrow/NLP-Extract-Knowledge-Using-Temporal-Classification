Foreign investors have committed 4.7 billion  dollars to projects in India since the doors were opened to them by a  liberalisation programme in August 1991, the government said Monday.
More than 80 percent of the funds were pledged to "priority industries,"  the fuel and the oil refining sector topping the list followed by power  generation, food processing and metallargical industries.
Actual investment between August 1991 and March 1994, which marked the end  of the last financial year, amounted to a modest 1.1 billion dollars, a  government statement said.
US companies pumped in 218 million dollars of that sum, followed by  British and German companies with 153 million dollars and 78 million dollars  respectively.
The government has previously attributed the large gap between funds  committed by foreign investors and actual inflows to a long gestation period  required for projects in high-tech, capital-intensive areas to materialise.
Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao launched the liberalisation  programme soon after coming to power in 1991, allowing a majority shareholding  for foreign investors and easing investment and repatriation procedures.
The liberalisation overturned four decades of protectionism under which  foreign companies were shunned in the belief they would hurt domestic industry.
