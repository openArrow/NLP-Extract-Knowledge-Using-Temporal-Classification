After three months of record-breaking sales  overseas, South Korea's auto exports slowed to 58,100 units in April, but were  still up  6.6 percent from a year ago, manufacturers said Saturday.
The average monthly growth of auto exports from January through March was  18.1 percent, but automakers here shipped only 84 percent of their monthly  export goal in April, the Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association said.
Meanwhile, domestic sales in April jumped 14.8 percent from a year ago to  139,200 vehicles, causing delayed delivery and forcing makers to turn some of  their overseas shipments to the domestic market, the association said.
The average first quarter monthly increase of domestic sales was 7.1  percent, it said.
