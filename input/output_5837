A presidential sighting would normally be  exciting for the thousands of tourists who stream into Washington every year.
But one group had an unusual reaction Tuesday when they saw President Bill  Clinton on his early morning run from the White House to the Capitol and back.
When the president passed a group of tourists about a block from the White  House, a photographer shouted to them, "What more could you ask for?"
One man -- to cheers from his companions -- bellowed back: "George Bush!"
