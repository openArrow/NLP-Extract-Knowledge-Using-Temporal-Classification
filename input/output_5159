England's cricket selectors have recruited  Australian youth international Craig White for the first Test against New  Zealand, starting at Trent Bridge on Thursday.
The 24-year-old all-rounder, born in Yorkshire but brought up in  Australia, was one of three newcomers in a 13-man squad announced here Sunday.
The other rookies are Yorkshire's Richard Stemp and Steve Rhodes who plays  for Worcestershire.
White attended the Australian Cricket Academy in Adelaide and represented  Australia at youth level. He made his debut for Yorkshire in 1990 after  returning to make his home in the county he left as a seven-year-old when his  parents emigrated to Australia.
Left-arm spinner Stemp, 26, joined Yorkshire from Worcestershire in 1993,  while 29-year-old wicketkeeper Rhodes has played for Worcestershire since 1985  after being on Yorkshire's staff from 1981-84.
New chairman of selectors Illingworth, a former Yorkshire player himself,  has also won the argument for the inclusion of only five specialist batsmen.
England's record Test run-getter Graham Gooch, Mike Atherton's predecessor  as captain, returns after missing the winter tour of the West Indies -- and  there are also recalls for left-arm paceman Mark Ilott, Derbyshire all-rounder  Phil De Freitas and Essex off-spinner Peter Such.
The unlucky omissions include Surrey left-hander Graham Thorpe, who did  well in the Caribbean, and John Crawley, the fast-emerging 22-year-old  Lancashire batsmen who starred on the winter A tour of South Africa and made  281 not out against Somerset on Friday.
Atherton, Alec Stewart, Angus Fraser, Robin Smith and Graeme Hick are the  only survivors from England's last Test in Antigua last month, with those five  plus fast bowler Devon Malcolm the only survivors from the 17-strong West  Indies tour party.
