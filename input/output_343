Northern Yemeni leaders rejected late Friday a  southern ceasefire plan to end fighting which has opposed rival forces for the  past nine days, and demanded the surrender of southern chiefs.
An official spokesman said by telephone from the Yemeni capital Sanaa that  there was "nothing new" in the seven-point plan put forward in Aden by the  southern Yemen Socialist Party (YSP).
He said that "the legitimate leadership in Sanaa demands the surrender of  the war criminal" ousted vice-president Ali Salem al-Baid, who heads the YSP.
They also wanted the surrender of "all the others responsible for the war,  so that they can be judged for war crimes."
The plan put forward Friday by the YSP called for an "immediate end to the  war" and the creation of a government of national unity.
The government would be charged with "wiping out the consequences of the  war" and conducting an inquiry into "those responsible for the war," a source  said in the southern stronghold of Aden.
