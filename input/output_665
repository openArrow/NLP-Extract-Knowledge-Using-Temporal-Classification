French and British transport ministers Bernard  Bosson and John MacGregor reached agreement Sunday on opening Paris's Orly  airport to British airline flights by the end of June.
In a joint statement released here, the two ministers said they would open  the Orly-London link as soon as possible, and at the latest by the end of June.
The British government agreed to ensure that British carriers led by  British Airways (BA) cancelled plans to start flights to and from Orly Monday  in defiance of a current landing ban by French authorities, a spokesman for  the French transport ministry said.
On the French side, outstanding technical problems would be resolved in  the context of existing European (Union) regulations, the statement said.
In Britain problems faced by French carriers to gain landing slots at  British airports "will be examined with the same openness" and in the context  of EU rules on slot allocations, the statement added.
