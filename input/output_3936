A senior South African official is in Iran on the  first such visit here since the 1979 Islamic revolution, the official Iranian  news agency IRNA reported Wednesday.
Nico Nel, the director of the foreign ministry's Middle Eastern Bureau,  met Wednesday with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Hashemi to discuss  boosting ties.
The two countries are exploring ways of cooperating in industry and trade.
Nel said he hoped South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo would soon  visit Iran, according to IRNA.
Iran and South Africa restored diplomatic ties on May 10, after a 15-year  break following the revolution which deposed the late Shah, a friend of South  Africa.
Tehran announced earlier this year that it would normalise relations with  post-apartheid South Africa and stressed it sought close economic ties.
An Iranian oil delegation visited South Africa in January.
