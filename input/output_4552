Four gunmen who fled by helicopter Friday after  they hijacked a bus carrying schoolchildren, teachers and parents in the  Russian Caucasus landed in the rebel republic of Chechnya, an interior  ministry official said.
The hostage-takers fled with eight million dollars ransom and four  hostages, one man and three women.
The helicopter landed in the town of Bacha-Yurt, located about 15  kilometers (seven miles) from the border of neighobring Dagestan, the official  said.
Seven armed forces helicopters tailed the hijackers, who flew out of the  Caucasus town of Mineralnye Vody earlier in the day after having released most  of the hostages, ITAR-TASS reported.
The drama began Thursday afternoon when the gunmen seized the bus near  Mineralnye Vody as it travelled from the North Ossetian city of Vladikavkaz en  route to the southern Russian city of Stavropol.
Chechnya, a republic located in the Northern Caucasus, declared  independence from Moscow in 1991 and has since virtually shunned all federal  authority on its territory.
The republic is the birthplace of Russia's most ruthless gangs and is  considered a hotbed of crime.
