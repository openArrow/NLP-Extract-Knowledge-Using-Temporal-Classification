The PLO has cancelled a 7.5 million dollar contract  with an Austrian firm aimed at turning media coverage of Yasser Arafat's  arrival in the Gaza Strip and Jericho into a money-spinner, the organisation  announced Thursday.
Abed Rabbo, spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Organisation, said it  had "been decided to cancel the contract to avoid any constraints on press  coverage of this event or of any other Palestinian activity."
The Vienna-based Teleaxis Holding had been called in to organise media  bidding for coveted places among Arafat's entourage when he visits the  newly-autonomous areas of Gaza and Jericho for the first time next month.
But the idea ran into trouble, with some PLO officials complaining that  Arafat had been turned into a commodity.
Journalists and businessmen were to have been asked to pay 20,000 dollars  to travel with the Arafat from PLO headquarters in Tunis and back, as well as  to dine with him and have access to his itinerary.
For 10,000 dollars reporters were to be allowed to buy a place at banquets  and see Arafat at close quarters. Photographers were to have been charged  20,000.
Normally Arafat is highly secretive about his schedules for security  reasons.
Only press conferences, public events and speeches were to have been free  of charge.
The money, after Teleaxis had taken its share and after covering security  costs, was to have gone to building a science and culture academy.
The PLO press department will now handle the coverage, in conjunction with  local Palestinian press services.
