World Cup fans at Stanford Stadium in California  and in Washington are almost certain to be fenced in, against the wishes of  FIFA and tournament organizers, World Cup chairman Alan Rothenberg confirmed  Thursday.
"The position of the organizing committee and FIFA is clear and consistent  -- we are against fencing," Rothenberg said. "Ultimately it's the local law  enforcement that has responsibility for the safety and security of the public.  We don't have any ability to veto their decisions."
He said police in Dallas were also in favor of fences, but were still  discussing the issue.
"We only have the power of persuasion," Rothenberg said. "There is still a  chance there might be modification in Dallas. We're not aware of any possible  changes at Stanford Stadium (in Palo Alto, California) or at RFK Stadium in  Washington."
Though many European clubs have fences, Rothenberg said the trend in  Europe was away from fencing.
Fences were banned in England in 1989 after 95 Liverpool fans were crushed  to death at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield during an FA Cup semi-final.
He also said organizers believed the bulk of fans at World Cup matches did  not pose a threat to the safety of playes and officials on the pitches.
"Two-thirds of our tickets have been sold in the United States," he said.  "All our demographics indicate that is a family audience, a mother and father  and two kids. That's a group as unlikely to anything damaging as any group you  can think of."
Rothenberg said the football associations in countries where hooliganism  is rife had efficient methods of preventing known troublemakers from buying  Cup tickets.
"It is very unlikely that patrons of tour operators are troublemakers," he  said. "And the tickets distributed through the national associations, they  have a pretty good distribution mechanism where they screen who buys. They  tend to know who hooligans are and don't sell to them."
