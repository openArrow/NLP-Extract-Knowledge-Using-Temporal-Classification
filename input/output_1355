A 12-year-old girl kidnapped by two  brothers who wanted ransom money was kept bound hand and foot for 11 days in a  dark dungeon-like bunker underneath a motorway bridge, Essen police said  Tuesday.
The impecunious brothers had demanded two million marks (1.25 million  dollars) from Maria Schneider's caretaker parents to release her, apparently  mistaking the girl for the child of a wealthy couple.
The brothers aged 26 and and 19 kept her 11 days in the bunker, lying upon  a mattress bound hand-and-foot and tied to an iron pillar, until her cries  were heard by chance by a worker on Monday and she was freed.
The head of the police investigation, Rudi Pawelka, said the girl had  stood up well to the ordeal, which he described as "days-long torture". He  said that for her age Maria had a strong personality and was in stable  condition.
The brothers, a gardner and an unemployed apprentice motor mechanic, were  arrested Monday night after a farmer woman who saw them by the bridge reported  the registration number of their car to police after the girl's release.
The two had kidnapped the girl May 5 in a well-to-do residential area and  refused to believe she was not the daughter of the wealthy man whose villa her  parents looked after.
Needing somewhere to live, they had originally planned to live in the  bunker but, inspired by a television series, they then hit on the idea of  kidnapping a child for ransom money.
