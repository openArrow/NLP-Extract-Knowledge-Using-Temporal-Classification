Beijing's security chief has called for a strict  public order crackdown in the capital, a report said Tuesday less than two  weeks before the fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.
Su Zhongxiang, director of the Beijing municipal Public Security Bureau  (PSB), called on all the capital's PSB organs to strengthen the defence of  social stability and deal swiftly "with any problems that might emerge  suddenly."
Su, whose remarks were carried on the front page of the Public Security  News, also stressed the importance of what was called preventative policing in  clamping down on criminal activity.
Security has been noticeably stepped up in Beijing in the past month amid  heightened tension in the run-up to the anniversary of the June 4 suppression  of the 1989 pro-democracy movement.
According to western military analysts, the number of People's Armed  Police in Beijing has been steadily built up since 1989 and now totals some  100,000 officers who have been given intensive anti-riot training.
A general law and order crackdown launched at the beginning of the year  has achieved "certain successes," the newspaper said.
"But, in order to guarantee social order, the Beijing PSB has decided that  all departments must take a stronger initiative in suppressing criminal  activity."
The Beijing police have uncovered 2,731 criminal cases since January and  broken up more than 400 criminal gangs, the newspaper added.
Su's remarks follow a series of warnings by top government and party  officials on the issue of public order nationwide.
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng both made recent speeches --  given wide publicity in the Chinese media -- stressing the paramount  importance of ensuring social stability by all means necessary.
Jiang even went so far as to defend the military suppression of June 4,  which he credited for laying the foundation for China's current stability.
