Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev on Sunday  thanked Pakistan and Afghanistan after two Russian prisoners from the  Afghanistan war were freed last week.
Alexis Olenin, 31, and Yuri Stepanov, 25, captured by Afghan Prime  Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami faction during the Russian  occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s, were handed to Russian officials in  Islamabad, Pakistan, last Monday.
They were freed on Hekmatyar's orders and transfered to Islamabad,  diplomatic sources said.
Kozyrev said he hoped the "constructive co-operation between Russia,  Afghanistan and Pakistan would continue, aimed at settling humanitarian and  military problems," the ITAR-TASS new agency reported, citing a foreign  ministry statement.
The statement said some 290 former Red Army soldiers are still missing in  Afghanistan of whom between 60 and 70 are thought to be alive. Efforts to find  them must continue, it added.
No information was given on the condition of the two men nor how long they  had been held.
