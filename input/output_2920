He was on 111 points in the championship. Schwantz was on 88 and John  Kocinski, the Australian GP winner who was fifth today on his Cagiva, was  third on 79 points.
Shinishi Itoh of Japan, riding a Honda, was fourth in today's race. He was  fourth in the championship on 56 points.
Schwantz, second fastest in practice, never caught up after after a poor  start and an exciting battle with Criville.
"I just got a bad start," the Texan said. "I rode as hard as I could the  entire race but never got near."
Doohan agreed the start had been decisive.
"I knew I'd have to break away at the beginning otherwise Kevin would have  hung in my draught. But it wasn't an easy race," he said.
Bike speed had been important on the sweeping Salzburgring circuit.
"We had some speed on those guys," Doohan admitted. "I conbratulate my  team for giving me such a great bike."
He now goes to Germany for a race next weekend on another fast track at  Hockenheim which should give him another advantage on his rivals.
