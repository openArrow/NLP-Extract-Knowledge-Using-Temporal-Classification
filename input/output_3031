Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring announced Sunday  a review of security arrangements along the border with Northern Ireland after  loyalist paramilitaries attacked an IRA fundraiser in Dublin, killing another  man.
Describing Saturday's killing as a "sinister development," Spring said  security would be reviewed to prevent an upsurge in attacks inside Ireland by  Ulster loyalists.
He said the implications of the killing would dominate discussions Monday  in Ballyconnell, Northern Ireland, with British Secretary of State for the  province, Sir Patrick Mayhew.
The Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), an illegal loyalist (Protestant)  paramilitary grouping, Sunday claimed responsibility for the attack on the  Irish Republican Army (IRA) fundraiser in a Dublin bar which killed one man  and injured another.
The attackers also left a small bomb at the pub, whose detonater exploded.  The main charge failed to go off, however, and was defused by police.
Since the sectarian conflict erupted 25 years ago, Northern Ireland-based  loyalist paramilitaries have very rarely crossed the border to carry out  attacks in the southern Republic, due mainly to the absence of a reliable  support network.
The outlawed IRA draws its support from Ulster's Roman Catholic community.
