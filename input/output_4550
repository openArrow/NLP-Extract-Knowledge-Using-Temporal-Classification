The flesh-eating bacterium which has struck  Britain killed a woman in northern Israel but another Israeli was saved by  having a leg amputated, hospitals said Friday.
Hospital officials said the woman in the town of Afula died within 24  hours of catching the gangrene-like infection, group A streptococci, two  months ago.
Another woman, infected in the leg, was amputated and survived on a heavy  dose of antibiotics.
The health ministry said around 20 cases were reported in Israel each  year, and reassured the public there was no epidemic.
Fifteen people across Britain have been infected by the mutant  flesh-eating bacterium this year and 11 are known to have died from it,  British health authorities said Thursday.
Cases of the killer bug have been on the increase around the world over  the past five years, according to the World Health Organisation.
