Former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis,  who died of cancer late Thursday aged 64, "was a model of courage and  dignity," President Bill Clinton said in a statement early Friday.
"More than any other woman of her time, she captivated our nation and the  world with her intelligence, elegance and grace," the statement added.
"Even in the face of impossible tragedy, she carried the grief of her  family and our entire nation with a calm power that somehow reassured all of  us who mourned," the president said.
"We hope that Mrs. Onassis' children, John and Caroline, and her  grandchildren find solace in the extraordinary contributions she made to our  country," he added.
Clinton told reporters earlier that he and his wife, Hillary, had been  given regular updates on Onassis' condition and had spoken with her over the  past few days.
"She's been quite wonderful to my wife, to my daughter (Chelsea) and to  all of us," Clinton said.
