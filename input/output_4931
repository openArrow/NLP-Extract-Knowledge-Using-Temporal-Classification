Experienced Zvereva made sure she would be Halard's next opponent when she  outplayed Taiwan's Shi-Ting Wang 6-2, 6-1.
And Spain's third-seed Conchita Martinez endured and finally wore down the  attacks of Dutch opponent Brenda Schultz.
Schultz, who has the biggest serve in women's tennis, lost her temper over  a line-call while trailing 3-5 in the first set.
After being told by linesman and umpire that the ball was 'out', Schultz  screamed loudly and kicked out at the mark.
It did her no harm, for she managed to get back to 5-5.
But the nagging baseline accuracy of Martinez finally survived the  bombardment of serves and volleys from the Dutch player and she moved safely  through to face Dechaume.
