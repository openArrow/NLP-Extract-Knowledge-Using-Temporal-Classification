Marion Barry, the former Washington mayor who  served six months in prison after being filmed smoking crack cocaine, hit the  campaign trail Monday with his eye on his old office.
Barry, who said he would formally launch his campaign over the weekend,  picked up petition forms needed to become a candidate on Monday.
The former chemistry teacher and civil rights activist served as  Washington mayor from 1978 to 1990, and was arrested in January 1990 in a  much-publicized drug sting at a downtown hotel.
He says he became a new man in prison, has re-married, began to don  African-style dress and moved into a home in the city's poorest ward. Barry  now represents that ward on the Washington city council.
