Spain won two tight singles rubbers  against Sweden to reach the final of the World Team Cup on Friday.
Carlos Costa overcame Jan Apell 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 and French Open champion    Sergi Bruguera then beat Stefan Edberg 7-6, (8/6), 5-7, 6-3 to clinch the  final place.
Costa pulled the match around after the first set against Apell, a  stand-in for Magnus Gustafsson, whose injured shoulder was too painful for him  to play.
Rain stopped play for more than two hours at the beginning of the 2nd set  and when they re-started Costa quickly swept to a 5-1 lead.
Brugera had an even more difficult task in trying to shake off Edberg,  taking 2h 26min to win.
Edberg held a point for the 1st set at 5-4 but netted a return and  Bruguera went on to take the tiebreak and race to 3-0 in the second.
The Swede battled back to 3-3 and the games went with serve until the  11th, when Edberg clinched the break with a forehand return.
Bruguera was always ahead in the third but he had to struggle to close out  the match as Edberg twice recovered breaks. The crucial breakthrough came with  a service return that gave the Spaniard a 5-3 lead but even then Edberg did  not give up and he missed a chance to break back when he netted an overhad.
Edberg saved one match point with a drop shot but there was nothing he  could do with Bruguera's pass on the Spaniard's next chance.
The Czech Republic won both their singles to beat Australia in a dead  match. Neither side could reach the final.
