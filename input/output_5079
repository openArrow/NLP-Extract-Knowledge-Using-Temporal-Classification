The Khmer Rouge refused to agree a ceasefire  during peace talks in North Korea with the Cambodian government, according to  a government statement released here.
The government had agreed to a ceasfire proposal by King Norodom Sihanouk,  but Khmer Rouge nominal leader Khieu Samphan rejected the proposal, according  to the statement released by the Royal Palace late Saturday.
The two days of peace talks ended Saturday in Pyongyang with no accord.  But the two sides will meet again next month in Phnom Penh. They are also to  form a committee to deal with issues dividing them.
The Khmer Rouge expressed support last week for a ceasefire and the  setting up of a joint ceasefire commission. But it said agreement would be  dependent on the participation of international observers.
Both sides in the long-running civil war pledged to keep Cambodia intact,  without partition or secession, according to a joint declaration released at  the end of the talks which finished two days earlier than scheduled.
The statement said the government and the rebels would work for national  reconciliation and a ceasefire.
The peace talks were hosted by King Sihanouk at his residence in Pyongyang  and brought together co-premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh, parliamentary  chairman Chea Sim and Khieu Samphan.
Khieu Samphan raised the possibility of including members of his radical  faction in the government and armed forces, one of the points in a peace plan  proposed by the king.
The king's plan would give government posts to "acceptable" members of the  Khmer Rouge, despite their boycott of UN-sponsored elections in 1993, in  return for opening up their zones and merging their forces with the Cambodian  army.
