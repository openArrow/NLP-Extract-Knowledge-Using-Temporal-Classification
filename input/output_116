US and Cambodian customs officials are holding  a joint anti-drug seminar here aimed at helping Cambodia prevent the  trafficking of drugs across its borders, a US embassy official said Friday.
The eight-day seminar, which opened Tuesday, is aimed at "helping Cambodia  combat international drug trafficking and increase customs skills across the  board," US embassy spokesman Dave Miller said.
Cambodia's lawlessness has contributed to the relative ease of transit of  high-grade heroin from the Golden Triangle to its southern ports on the Gulf  of Thailand.
Cambodian law does not specifically outlaw drugs, but smuggling  "contraband" -- which is undefined by law, but interpreted to include drugs  and weapons -- carries a jail term of 25 years.
