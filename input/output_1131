Radical surgery on the home built a century ago  by Treasure Island author Robert Louis Stevenson is on schedule and the once  beautiful wooden building will be reopened in time for the centenary of his  death at the end of the year, project manager Bob Gardiner said Tuesday.
Stevenson built his home at Vailima, in the hills above the capital Apia,  and lived there for the last four years of his life, dying in 1894.
The building, much modified over the years, had become the official  residency of the Head of State until recently, when two hurricanes battered it  into an unlivable state.
A group of three Americans, one-time Mormon missionaries in Western Samoa,  set up a trust and have raised six million tala (2.5 million US dollars) to  fund the renovation.
New Zealand's Fletcher Construction is virtually rebuilding Vailima from  scratch, leaving only the original fireplace as it was. Many of the extensions  added over the years have been torn down, although the reconstructed Vailima  will not be an exact match of the way Stevenson built it.
Gardiner said there were currently 56 workers on site, and it would be  ready by September in time for a formal opening and ceremonies to honour  Stevenson.
"All the front of the building is virtually complete, all the plywood  flooring inside is down and it's ready for the tongue and groove flooring on  it."
Redwood is being used for the exterior.
Meanwhile, a stray dog has had a puppy in the fireplace. Workers have  adopted it, but Gardiner said they had resisted the temptation of calling it  "Long John Silver," "Dr Jekyll," or "Mr Hyde" -- all celebrated Stevenson  characters.
They've rather pragmatically named the dog "Bluey."
