The position of shadow home secretary Tony Blair as  front-runner in the Labour leadership contest across all social classes is  confirmed by the latest MORI poll, published in the Times Friday.
The poll puts Blair, on 29 percent, in the lead across all social classes  throughout Britain and confirm Blair's standing as the favourite among Labour  supporters and union members, who will play a key part in the balloting in  July.
John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, on 18 percent, is clearly in  second place, followed by Margaret Beckett, the acting leader, and Gordon  Brown, the shadow chancellor, who are level pegging on 11 percentage points.
Meanwhile, Prescott Thursday became the latest of the leadership  contenders to set out his stall.
In common with other contenders who have made big speeches in recent days,  Prescott denied he was launching his campaign.
However, it was clear from a barn-storming performance to the Prison  Officers' Association in Portsmouth, southern England, that Prescott, whether  he enters the race for the leadership, deputy leadership or both, will present  himself as the defender of traditionalist Labour values.
With Labour currently well-placed to oust the Conservative Party from  power in the next general election, probably in 1996, the next Labour leader  looks destined to be Britain's prime minister.
MORI, which the Times said has provided the most comprehesive guide so far  to public views on the leadership, interviewed a representative quota sample  of 1,929 adults at 150 constituency sampling points last weekend after the  funeral of Labour's late leader John Smith.
Labour announced Wednesday it would hold the leadership contest as soon as  possible, giving the result on July 21 rather than running a four-month  campaign until October.
