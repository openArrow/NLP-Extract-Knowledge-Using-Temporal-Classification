Bad loans for Japan's nine government-sponsored  financial institutions rose 3.4 percent from a year earlier to 419.6 billion  yen (four billion dollars) in the year to March 1993, the audit board said  Thursday.
The board also said total outstanding loans for the nine institutions,  including the Japan Development Bank, rose 9.3 percent from a year earlier to  94.28 trillion yen (0.9 trillion dollars) in the same year.
The ratio of bad loans to outstanding loans fell to 0.45 percent from 0.47  percent of the previous year due to higher growth in outstanding loans, the  economic newspaper Nihon Keizai said.
Bad loans were listed as those more than six months overdue.
The People's Finance Corp., mainly serving smaller enterprises, topped the  list of bad loans with 127.5 billion yen (1.2 billion dollars) among the nine  institutions, the newspaper said.
The ratio of bad loans for Japan's 11 major commercial banks in the year  to March 1993 averaged 3.1 percent from a year earlier. The Sakura Bank alone  chalked up 1.36 trillion yen (13 billion dollars) in bad loans, surpassing the  total for the government-sponsored institutions, the paper said.
The newspaper attributed the lower ratio for the public institutions to  their non-involvement in financing real estate business during the "bubble  economy" investment boom in the 1980s, the newspaper said.
The ratio is expected to level off in the year to March 1994, due to  steady growth in outstanding loans, the paper added.
