A rugby official whose team  suffered a record loss came up Monday with a novel excuse -- fertiliser.
The Marist club inflicted a senior rugby record 169-0 defeat on Suburbs  Saturday, and Suburbs' president Colin Bell suspects fertiliser spread on the  pitch as the likely culprit.
Suburbs were without nine regular players due to infections.
"A number of the guys have got these infections. We don't know what's  contributed but it certainly came after one or two games on the paddock," Bell  said.
He has sought advice from medical professionals, who he hoped would be  able to tell him what caused the festering sores which resulted after players  got cuts or grazes recently.
Bell said he did not want to make "rash statements" about whether  fertiliser was the cause of the infections but believed one of the two grounds  at Suburbs has something on it which could cause such injuries.
