Japanese trading giant Mitsubishi Corp. said  Thursday its pre-tax earnings tumbled 33.4 percent from a year earlier to 50.3  billion yen (488 million dollars) in the year to March.
The main company in the diversified Mitsubishi group said sales declined  5.8 percent to 14,123 billion yen in the same period, depresed by lower  revenue from all areas except metals trading and domestic transactions.
Mitsubishi forecast a higher profit of 53 billion yen in the current year  but projected a further decline in sales to 13,000 billion yen. Net profit,  which plunged 79.1 percent to 3.2 billion yen, was forecast at 15 billion yen.
The company said earnings were depressed by lower revenue in addition to  special losses arising from overseas investments, loans to affiliates which  were written off and sales of securities.
"The fall in revenue was due to declines in fuel, machinery and services  although metal trading increased," the company said.
"The United States recovered while economies in Asia remained brisk. But  the recession in Japan and Europe became more severe. In Japan, sluggish  increases in salaries led to a slowdown in personal consumption. Meanwhile,  poor business conditions and slowing demand affected capital investment."
Mitsubishi said metals trading revenue grew 9.8 percent to 4,553 billion  yen. But fuel sales plunged 26.2 percent to 1,812 billion yen as revenue from  its machinery and information businesses fell 9.1 percent to 3,975 billion yen.
Food sales dropped 1.3 percent to 1,645 billion yen, chemical sales  decreased 7.5 percent to 1,054 billion yen and revenue from textile,  commodities and other products was down 10.8 percent at 1,084 billion yen.
Export revenue dropped 10.2 percent to 2,267 billion yen, import revenue  dived 20.5 percent to 2,372 billion yen and revenue from offshore transactions  fell 7.1 percent to 2,562 billion. But revenue from trading activities in  Japan was up 2.9 percent at 6,922 billion yen, the company said.
