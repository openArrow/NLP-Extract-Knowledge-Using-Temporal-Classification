Polish President Lech Walesa will be seeking to  boost his country's exports to Switzerland when he begins an official  three-day visit there on Wednesday, Polish officials said Tuesday.
Walesa was due to be accompanied by a delegation of businessmen and  bankers, including National Bank of Poland president Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz,  and was scheduled to meet Swiss counterpart Otto Stich.
On Friday, the Polish leader was to participate in round table discussions  with Swiss business sources, following a series of unofficial engagements.
Poland is chiefly seeking to boost its exports to Switzerland, ranked just  13th among countries providing Warsaw with foreign earnings.
The Poles also want more investment from the Swiss. To date, 230 Swiss  firms have started up in Poland, but they have brought in investment of just  170 million dollars.
