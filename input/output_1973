German car manufacturer Volkswagen on  Thursday said the company had reduced its first quarter deficit this year by  7.25 percent from last year's 1.247 billion marks (779 million dollars).
The net loss was down to 342 million marks for the first three months of  1994, the company said.
At its annual conference in March, Volkswagen had forecast a loss of about  400 million marks (250 million dollars) in the first quarter of 1994.
In its intermediary report issued Thursday, the Volkswagen group said it  saw "a good chance" for the whole year of improving results of Volkswagen AG  and returning to a balance in the group. It said this would be due notably to  a review of cost structures.
Turnover rose in the first quarter by 2.6 percent against the same period  last year, to 20.1 billion marks (12.5 billion dollars) against 10.6 billion  (6.6 billion dollars) in 1993.
In its report Thursday, Volkswagen said that "a slight resumption of  automobile demand on the biggest markets" had not been enough to compensate  for problems with Volkswagen's Spanish subsidiary, Seat.
But it said that Volkswagen AG had managed to registered a profit of 35  million marks (21 million dollars) in the first quarter of 1994 after a heavy  loss of 917 million marks (573 million dollars) in the first three months of  1993.
