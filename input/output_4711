Canada is hoping to begin negotiations to supply  China with up to seven nuclear reactors in a deal worth 10.5 billion dollars  (about 7.5 billion US), a newspaper reported Friday.
The Toronto Star quoted Don Lawson, president of Atomic Energy of Canada  Ltd.'s Candu operations as saying: "The Chinese are desperately short of  electricity. We think we can fill some of that (shortage)."
Lawson, who said his company had the full support of International Trade  Minister Roy MacLaren in its efforts to reach an agreement with China, said  Beijing had recently agreed to include the Candu 6 reactor in government  studies of future Chinese needs.
The other major contenders for a possible Chinese contract are British-,  French- and US-made reactors, he said.
Lawson told the Star that his company hoped to sell up to seven reactors  to China, with the first contracts being signed within two years.
Each reactor would create some 2,000 direct jobs in Canada and a further  5,000 spin-off jobs, he said.
But he pointed out that no formal negotiations had yet started between his  company and Beijing
The news of a possible Canadian reactor contract comes shortly after last  month's visit to Ontario by Chinese Vice Premier Minister Zou Jiahau.
According to Lawson, Zou raised the possibility of a Canadian deal during  that visit.
A spokesman for Canada's Department of International Trade said no sale  would be approved before Ottawa and Beijing had agreed to "strict conditions"  to ensure Canadian technology was not exported to third countries.
