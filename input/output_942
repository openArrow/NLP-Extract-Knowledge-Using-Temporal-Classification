Kevin Richardson and Steve Bould will make their  senior England debuts against Greece at Wembley on Tuesday night.
Blackburn goalkeeper Tim Flowers is also back after almost a year's wait  for his second cap. And coach Terry Venables has also revived the  international careers of Liverpool defender Rob Jones and Arsenal midfielder  Paul Merson.
But in a team showing five changes from that which launched his England  reign with a 1-0 win against Denmark in March, there is no place for Matthew  Le Tissier, the second-half substitute for broken-leg victim Paul Gascoigne.
Venables was unable to call on any of his Manchester United trio after  Saturday's FA Cup triumph over Chelsea.
Paul Parker withdrew on Sunday with an ankle injury, centre-half Gary  Pallister was too tired to be considered and Paul Ince is battling for fitness  for Sunday's friendly against Norway at Wembley.
Ince's place goes to Aston Villa midfielder Richardson who, at 31,  believed all international recognition had passed him by until his shock  call-up last week. The Newcastle-born player was an inspiration in Ron  Atkinson's League Cup triumph.
Bould, another 31-year-old, teams up with his Arsenal central-defensive  partner Tony Adams after skippering the B side to a 4-2 win over Northern  Ireland last week, his first England cap.
Injury prevented Rob Jones from adding to his debut cap against France in  February, 1992, until he reappeared in last September's 3-0 win over Poland in  a Wembley World Cup qualifier. He takes over from Parker at right-back.
Many expected Le Tissier to emerge as the natural successor to Gascoigne.  But Merson is preferred. The 26-year-old will be winning his 14th cap, but  only his second of the season.
England: Flowers (Blackburn); Jones (Liverpool), Le Saux (Blackburn),  Richardson (Aston Villa), Bould (Arsenal), Adams (Arsenal), Platt (Sampdoria),  Merson (Arsenal), Shearer (Blackburn), Beardsley (Newcastle), Anderton  (Tottenham)
