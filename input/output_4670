After 15 years wearing pale blue uniforms, which  earned them the name of "periwinkles," Paris traffic wardens are to be dressed  in navy and red by French fashion designer Balenciaga.
Paris authorities said Friday that the new uniform would be available by  the beginning of next year.
Before the current blue uniform, the traffic wardens wore dark red and  were known by the general public as "aubergines."
