The brother of accused serial killer Frederick  West, charged with 11 murders in the "House of Horrors" case, was Wednesday  charged with two counts of rape, police said.
They said the rape charges against John West, 51, involved incidents that  allegedly occurred between 1975 and 1980.
He was released on bail for court appearance June 23.
Frederick West, a 52-year-old stone mason, is charged with the murders of  11 women, including his first wife and two daughters.
Nine of the bodies were unearthed from the garden, basement, walls and  floors of his house at 25 Cromwell Street here, known as the "house of  horrors," one was found in a field 20 kilometers (12 miles) away and the last  was found in another Gloucester house where West once lived.
Frederick West's current wife, Rosemary, a 40-year-old mother of eight, is  jointly charged with eight of the murders.
Rosemary West is also charged, in conjunction with two men, in the rape of  a girl under the age of 16, and assault against an eight-year-old boy.
There was no indication Thursday whether those charges were in any way  connected with the rape charges against John West.
Rosemary and Frederick West are being held without bail as police continue  to probe sites where they previously lived.  Sources close to the  investigation have said the body county in the case could go as high as 20.
