Brian Lara, who broke Gary Sobers' Test world  record by scoring 375 against England in April, could grab another world mark  after hitting his fifth successive first class century on Monday.
His latest hundred came against Somerset and means he needs just one more  to join three other legendary batsmen who have scored six first-class tons in  a row.
Lara, whose series began in the fifth Test between the West Indies against  England when Sobers' 36-year mark fell, this time reached three figures off  just 72 balls, the fastest of the season.
He ended up with 136 off 94 deliveries to help Warwickshire beat Somerset  on Monday by six wickets.
The Trinidadian left-hander hit 14 fours and two sixes as the visitors  reached their target of 321 off 53.4 overs.
Since arriving in England fresh from his Test world record, Lara had  recorded scores of 147, 106 and 120 not out before Monday's match-winning  effort.
He now needs to score a century in his next innings to join C B Fry  (1901), Sir Donald Bradman (1938-39) and Mike Procter (1970-71) in the six-ton  club.
Meanwhile Northamptonshire ended Surrey's unbeaten championship record,  winning by three three wickets with two balls to spare in a thrilling finish  at The Oval.
A delayed start persuaded Surrey's acting captain Martin Bicknell to  declare on the Friday score of 322 for eight, setting Northants a target of  316 to win off 89 overs.
Nigel Felton (87) laid the foundations to Northants' first win in any  competition this season before Mal Loye added the final flourish with a  top-class 66, which included a six and five fours.
Former Notts spinner Eddie Hemmings blocked out the final three balls at  Trent Bridge to deny the home side a dramatic victory over Sussex.
Chasing a target of 288, Sussex appeared to be cruising to victory at 249  for four thanks to a solid three-hour 94 from Bill Athey.
But spinners Andy Afford (five for 87) and West Indian Test star Jimmy  Adams (four for 80) then combined to send them crashing to 278 for nine --  including four wickets in the space of five deliveries.
