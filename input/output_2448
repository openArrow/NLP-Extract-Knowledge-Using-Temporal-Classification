England striker Les Ferdinand turned his back on  the chance of big money move on Friday, when he signed a new two year contract  with Queens Park Rangers.
But veteran midfielder Ray Wilkins, who won 84 England caps, has been  given a free transfer by QPR, and could now join newly-promoted London rivals  Crystal Palace.
Ferdinand, snapped up from non-League Hayes for 15,000 pounds seven years  ago, had reportedly been a target for Arsenal, Blackburn Rovers and Manchester  United.
Blackburn were said to have tabled a 4.75 million pound bid for the  powerful 27-year-old, who had a loan spell with Turkish club Beskitas Istanbul.
Rangers chairman Richard Thompson has been criticised by fans for selling  Andy Sinton to Sheffield Wednesday for 2.75 million pounds, and Darren Peacock  to Newcastle for 2.8 million pounds.
The Loftus Road club have also persuaded defender Clive Wilson, 32, to  sign a new one-year contract.
Manager Gerry Francis said: "To have signed both these players on new  deals has given me a chance.
"The news will give the club some credibility. It shows that we can hold  on to our best players."
Rangers had been reluctant to allow Wilkins, 37, to take up his new role  as coach to the England under-21 team, causing a rift between him and the club.
Wilkins said: "I've always said that I can play on until I'm 40, and  nothing has happened to change my mind."
