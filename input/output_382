A strong earthquake rocked the southern Philippines  before dawn Saturday, toppling power and communication lines and blacking out  the Pagadian City vicinity, but there were no immediate reports of casualties,  officials said.
The temblor, which struck at 4:12 a.m. (2012 GMT Friday), registered 5.7  on the Richter scale. Its epicenter was in the Illana Bay, a few kilometers  (miles) south of Pagadian, seismologist Lito Lanuza of the Philippine  Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) told AFP.
The quake destroyed at least five houses made of light materials near  Pagadian, and residents of coastal areas were evacuated to higher ground in  case of tsunamis, giant waves caused by earthquakes, senior police officer  Rodolfo Tual told AFP by telephone from Pagadian.
"It was very strong, but it lasted just a few seconds," Tual said, adding  that it reminded him of a major earthquake which caused tsunamis and killed  several hundred people in the south in 1976.
Pagadian police are now out in the streets to evaluate the damage, he  said, adding that there were no immediate reports of casualties.
He said the quake blacked out Pagadian and surrounding areas but that  power was restored about 25 minues later.
Lanuza said local officials in Pagadian reported to Phivolcs that the  temblor toppled power and communication lines and blacked out the city and  nearby eareas.
Two Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. water tank structures in the  city were toppled, he added.
He said several weaker aftershocks were recorded, but that Phivolcs'  initial calculation was that the quake was not the type that would cause  tsunamis.
The temblor was felt throughout the western half of the large southern  island of Mindanao, he added.
