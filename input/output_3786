Australian geologists said Wednesday they recorded  a large earthquake in Indonesia measuring 6.7 points on the open-ended Richter  scale.
The tremor, initially measured as a major quake of 7.0 points but since  downgraded, rocked the southern highlands of Irian Jaya, the province which  occupies the western half of the island of New Guinea.
"It is a large earthquake and probably caused landslides," said Keven  McCue, principle research scientist at the Australian Geological Survey  Organisation in Canberra.
The earthquake struck about 600 kilometres (380 miles) west of the  province's capital, Jayapura, and was centred at a shallow depth, which made  it more likely to cause damage.
"This is the same size as the recent Los Angeles earthquake so you can  imagine what it would do to buildings," McCue said.
Casualties would be minimised, he added, by the light structure of homes  in the area, which was highly-populated.
McCue said the quake struck at 2.03 p.m. eastern Australian time Wednesday  (0403 GMT).
