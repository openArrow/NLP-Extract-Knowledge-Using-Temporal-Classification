Tokyo remains the most expensive city in the world  for homes and offices, the economic daily Nihon Keizai reported Tuesday.
First-time home buyers have to pay 427,000 dollars in Tokyo compared with  an average of 143,000 dollars for 17 cities in the United States, Europe and  the Asia Pacific region chosen for a survey by the Japanese Association of  Real Estate Appraisal.
Osaka, Japan's second city, was the second most expensive, with home  buyers having to find 355,000 dollars.
The South Korean capital, Seoul, was the most expensive in relation to  income with the average worker having to find 7.7 times his annual salary to  buy a home.
This ratio is 6.33 in Tokyo, compared with two to three times' income in  Paris, London, New York and Los Angeles. The lowest was 1.9 in Chicago.
Office rents in Tokyo average 160,000 yean (1,542 dollars) a square meter,  3.4 times higher than in New York and 2.3 times above those in London, said  the daily Yomiuri, citing the same survey.
For an office-rental property investment of about 10 billon yen (95.2  million dollars), 89 percent of that would go towards the site alone in Tokyo,  the highest in the world.
An investment of this size would buy land and office accommodation of  around 3,045 square meters (32,764 square feet) in Tokyo, against 11,000  square meters (118,360 square feet) in London and 33,444 square meters  (359,857 square feet) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
