US Secretary of State Warren Christopher left for  Israel on Monday after a day of hectic diplomacy in Syria to try and forge a  peace accord on the disputed Golan Heights.
The secretary flew out of Damascus after two rounds of talks with Foreign  Minister Faruq al-Shara and consultations with his advisors. Straight after  arrival on Sunday, he held a four-hour meeting with President Hafez al-Assad.
Christopher was to brief Israeli officials on his talks in Syria, where  the official press called for a rapid Israeli withdrawal from the Golan and  reports said Syria wanted a complete pullout in three years.
