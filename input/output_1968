Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati will pay the  first visit to Cairo by a senior Iranian official since the 1979 Islamic  revolution when he attends a meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) later  this month, the Tehran Times said Thursday.
Iran and Egypt broke ties after the revolution and maintain diplomatic  contact at interest section level.
The paper said Velayati, who is due to leave for Cairo on May 30, could  meet his Egyptian counterpart Amr Mussa, but they "would not" discuss  improving bilateral ties.
The Iranian minister will be accompanied by a high-level political and  economic delegation including a member of parliament's foreign affairs  subcommittee, Jalal Sadatian, the English-language daily said.
Since the revolution Tehran has been represented at international  conferences in Cairo through low-ranking officials.
The two governments have on several occasions expressed a desire to  improve ties, but no breakthrough has yet been made due to the opposition from  Islamic hardliners in Iran.
The news of a meeting last September between Velayati and Mussa in the  sidelines of UN General Assembly triggered criticism from radicals.
