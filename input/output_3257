Roman Herzog, candidate of the Christian Union  parties led by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, was chosen Monday by a special federal  assembly to become the next German head of state.
Herzog won 696 votes, an absolute majority in the 1,324-member assembly.  On this third, decisive round, a simple majority would have sufficed.
The result was determined after the Free Democrats withdrew their  candidate and decided by a majority to back Herzog.
The Social Democrats' candidate Johannes Rau won 605 votes.
In an emotional acceptance speech, Herzog, aged 60, pledged to be "the  president of all Germans" and represent the new united Germany in the world.
Herzog, who is currently president of the constitutional court, takes up  his new office on July 1, when he replaces Richard von Weizsaecker who is  retiring after two five-year terms.
