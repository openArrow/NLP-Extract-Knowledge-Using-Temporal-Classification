Tanzania on Friday denied knowledge of Mozambican  government troops allegedly being trained secretly on its territory as claimed  by the Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO).
"We are not involved and would never be involved with such a thing," a  Tanzanian embassy spokesman in Maputo said.
But he added that the Tanzanian ambassador was "very much concerned"  about RENAMO's charge that the government was training soldiers at Nachingwea  military camp on Tanzania's southern border with Mozambique.
The ambassador has met senior government officials to express his concern,  but the spokesman would give no details.
The Ceasefire Committee (CCF) overseeing Mozambique's transition from  civil war to peace and democratic elections decided late Thursday to go ahead  with an investigation into the allegations.
RENAMO first alleged in April that, in violation of their 1992 peace  accord, the ruling Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO) party of President  Joaquim Chissano was training a battalion of soldiers at Nachingwea, a base  used by FRELIMO during its struggle for independence.
However, RENAMO's key witness, a soldier named Renungio Paconota who said  he escaped from Nachingwea, went missing earlier this month.
The government told the CCF that investigations should not go ahead  without the presence of the key witness, but RENAMO accused the authorities of  abducting Paconota.
The CCF president, UN representative Colonel Pier Segala, decided the  investigation should go ahead.
