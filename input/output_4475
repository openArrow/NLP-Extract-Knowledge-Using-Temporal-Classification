Hong Kong heaved a sigh of relief Friday at US  President Bill Clinton's decision to renew China's most favored nation (MFN)  trading status, with the government calling it "good news" for the colony.
"The decision has removed a significant area of uncertainty in the  immediate future," Chief Secretary Anson Chan, second in command to Governor  Chris Patten, said in a statement.
"We know that the US administration took into account Hong Kong's concerns  and we are grateful for that," she said.
The stock market took the news in its stride, actually falling slightly by  47.75 points to 9,433.96. Brokers said investors had widely expected Clinton  to renew MFN.
Hong Kong, the premier portal for Sino-US trade, would have seen its gross  domestic product fall by up to three percentage points had MFN not been  renewed, according to government estimates.
GDP has been forecast to grow 5.5 percent this year.
Some 75,000 Hong Kongers would also have lost their jobs, the government  said.
Chan, who went to Washington this year to lobby for unconditional MFN  renewal, expressed some concern over Clinton's import ban on certain Chinese  products.
But she added that the ban -- involving imports of Chinese-made armaments  -- was unlikely to have a significant impact "because of its very limited  scope."
"The United States and China are Hong Kong's two largest trading partners,  and good relations between them are a vital factor in our long-term success,"  she said.
Patten is currently on a visit to Britain.
