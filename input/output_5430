"It's a good feeling when my forehand and backhand are working," said  Larsson after his win, "and that was the case today. I think Jaime was tired.  He made a lot of errors."
Earlier Martina Navratilova, making her farewell appearance at the French  Open, spun out what could be her final centre-court appearance when she was  involved in a hard-fought two-and-a-half hour women's doubles match.
Navratilova, 37 and retiring at the end of the year, joined forces with  Manon Bollegraf of the Netherlands in a bid to add another victory to her  already formidable record of seven women's doubles triumphs at the event.
But the Czech-born American and her Dutch partner, seeded fourth, had  their path into the quarter-finals barred by third-round French opponents  Julie Halard and Nathalie Tauziat.
The French players came back after a shaky start to score a 2-6, 7-6  (7/3), 6-3 win.
Navratilova, who is fifth-seeded in the mixed-doubles with Australian Mark  Woodforde, has won two singles, seven doubles and two mixed doubles titles at  the French Open since she made her debut here in 1973.
The winner of a record 167 singles title, the former world number-one was  beaten in the first round of the singles last week.
