The nights may be clear and balmy on the  French Riviera, but the stars have singularly failed to come out on the  opening weekend of the 47th Cannes International Film Festival.
Clint Eastwood, who stole the show at the opening ceremony Thursday, has  withdrawn to his retreat in the mountains behind the town, while his  vice-president Catherine Deneuve has similarly headed for the hills.
The only minor celebrities in town, along with any director worth his  clapperboard, are holed up in various five-star hotels strictly on the  upmarket end of the Croisette seaside boulevard.
A far cry from the heady days of 1991 when US media-opportunity Madonna  had the newshounds racing for their mobile phones when she arrived unannounced  at the world's biggest filmfest.
Not that no stars are due in town before the festival reaches its climax  on Monday May 23.
The list of those due to make their way up the famous steps of the  Festival Palace over the next week inclwtes such household names as Bruce  Willis, John Travolta and Kathleen Turner.
A few French "vedettes" (stars) have also shown their faces on the  cocktail circuit -- notably Isabelle Adjani -- promoting her film "La Reine  Margot" (Queen Margot), the French frontrunner for the coveted Golden Palm  award.
There was also a report Saturday that Cannes regular Roman Polanski was  about to hit town with Sigourney Weaver and Ben Kingsley, fresh from shooting  a new film in Paris.
But for the hopeful star-gazers lined up on the Cannes sea-front, for the  moment at least, not a twinkle.
