About 1,000 people converged on this  tiny Wisconsin town to promote -- and enjoy -- marijuana at the Weedstock  festival.
But about 20 revellers' fun went up in smoke as they were arrested Sunday  on drug charges.
"Thank you for smoking pot," and "Hemp our premier natural resources,"  read banners at the sixth annual gathering of marijuana fans, who made the  pilgrimage to this village of about 300, in campers and on motorbikes.
"This is a great time," said organizer Ben Masel. "It brings people  together and it gives us the chance to educate them to the agricultural  benefits of hemp."
