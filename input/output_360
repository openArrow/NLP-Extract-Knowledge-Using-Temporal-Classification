More than a million people, most of them civilians, have been killed or  wounded by mines since 1975. An estimated 100 million of them are still  planted in about 60 countries and about 1.2 million are in arsenals around the  world. About 50 countries produce some 300 types of mines, and about 30  countries export them.
Sadaka Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, explained that the  presence of mines were hurting UN efforts to moved people displaced by war  back to their homes.
"Bringing people back to their countries, we have to make sure that the  roads to go back are safe," she said, noting that the United Nations have  stepped up their education and prevention efforts.
Ogata singled out Afghanistan, where each year 4,000 people are killed and  4,000 wounded by mines. Guatemala, Somalia, Iraq, Mozambique, Cambodia are  other countries that are most affected by the problem, she said.
"Nobody puts money in mine clearance research," said retired general  Patrick Glagden, director of the United Nation's mine clearing program. At the  same time, modern mines are made of plastic and escape metal detectors.
International representatives concluded the treaty on in Geneva in the  fall of 1980. The United States signed on in 1982, but has failed to ratify it.
More than 100 million landmines lie unexploded in at least 62 countries,  human rights groups reported. They also said worldwide production may be  reaching 10 million anti-personnel landmines annually. The American Red Cross  reported landmines kill more than 200 civilians every week.
Clinton termed the treaty "a modest but significant humanitarian effort to  protect the victims of armed conflict from the effects of particular weapons."
He also said ratification would strengthen US efforts urging an  international moratorium on the export of anti-personnel landmines.
