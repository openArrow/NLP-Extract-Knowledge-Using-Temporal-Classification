John Smith, the late leader of Britain's  opposition Labour Party, was buried Saturday next to the remains of Scottish  kings on this Hebrides island, eight days after dying of a heart attack.
Smith, himself a Scot, was laid to rest on the tiny island which where  some 40 Scottish monarchs are buried, among them King Duncan, who died in  1040. Legend has it that Duncan's assassin, Macbeth, is also buried there.
Normally, only those born on Iona and those who die there have the right  to a burial on the island, but local authorities made an exception for Smith,  who often used to holiday here. He was born at Ardrishaig, on the Scottish  west coast.
On Friday, leading British politicians, including Conservative Prime  Minister John Major and Labour frontbenchers, attended a funeral service for  Smith in Edinburgh.
