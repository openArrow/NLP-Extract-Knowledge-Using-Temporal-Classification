An ultraconservative Haitian group called  Monday for a nationwide mobilization to prepare for a possible US invasion,  saying their countrymen would fight with sticks and stones if necessary.
The Haitian Front for Advancement and Progress (FRAPH), a group with close  links to the military, said it was prepared to defend against US military  intervention, which US President Bill Clinton has said he would not rule out  as a means of restoring exiled president Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected president, was ousted in a  military coup in September 1991.
"In case of US intervention, the FRAPH will automatically become the  Revoutionary Armed Front for the Haitian People," said Emmanuel Constant,  secretary general of the group.
Constant said Aristide can no longer return to Haiti "not because of the  military but because his drop in popularity in the face of a strong  center-right force."
In a separate development, the United Nations-Organization of American  States human rights mission here condemned an attack in which four political  activists were shot dead in a shantytown near the capital.
A statement issued by the mission said the four were killed by "an  undetermined number of heavily armed civilians" in the Cite Soleil  neighborhood.
A fifth person was said to have been critically wounded and several others  injured in the attack, which the UN-OAS mission said appeared to be part of a  pattern of intimidation.
"These executions seem to flow from a logic of systematic elimination of  members of popular organizations whose members are seeking a return to  constitutional rule," the statement said.
Haitian authorities have so far refused to yield to UN demands to restore  Aristide despite a near total trade embargo imposed by the international  organization Sunday and persistent tough talk from Washington.
