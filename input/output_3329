A meeting to review economic reforms in 29 African  countries, opened in the Zimbabwean capital Monday, under the auspices of the  World Bank, which is backing the reform programmes.
The two-day seminar is discussing a World Bank report which examined the  extent of policy reforms and their impact on growth and poverty in 29  Sub-Saharan countries that took up economic adjustment programmes from  mid-1980s.
A summary of the 436-page report released here Monday concluded that  African countries had improved economic policies and restored growth, but  warned "that they still have a long way to go in adopting the policies needed  to move onto a faster growth path and reduce poverty.
The reforms, even incompletely implemented "can put African countries on  the road to development", the report said while cautioning Africans against  placing "unrealistically high hopes" in the reforms.
It said that in those countries that have achieved some increase in  growth, "the majority of the poor are probably better off and almost certainly  no worse off".
In general, the survey shows that progress has been mixed and the reforms  in all the countries are still incomplete.
"Despite efforts to improve the macro-economic environment, open up  markets, and strengthen the public and financial sectors, most African  countries still lack policies that are sound by international standards," the  report warns.
Even the continent's best perfomers have worse macro-economic policies  than the newly industrialising economies of Asia.
Few countries, besides Ghana, are close to having adequate monetary,  fiscal and exchange rate policies, while Kenya and Zimbabwe, have moved slowly  towards import liberalisation.
For the success of the programmes in Africa, the report recommends keeping  budget deficits small, encouraging competition and higher productivity,  abolishing government marketing boards and privatising public enterprises.
