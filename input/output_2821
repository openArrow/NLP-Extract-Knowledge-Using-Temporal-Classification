President Bill Clinton and his  wife, Hillary, will attend Monday's burial of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis at  Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia, the White House said Saturday.
"The White House is ready to assist the Kennedy family in any way," deputy  press secretary Ginny Terzano said.
Clinton was in Sacramento wrapping up a two-day visit to California.
Terzano said the Kennedy family had not yet expressed their wishes with  regard to the burial ceremony at the suburban Washington cemetery where  Onassis' late first husband, slain president John F. Kennedy, is interred.
Two of the couple's children are also buried there -- a daughter who was  stillborn in 1956 and a son who died shortly after birth in 1963.
The entire cemetry will be closed Monday afternoon for the burial.
"If they want to keep it private, we will honor their wishes," Terzano  said.
