Jazz guitarist Sonny Sharrock, a free-jazz  pioneer mentioned as an influence by guitarists Carlos Santana and Elliott  Sharp, has died, his agent Mary McGuire said Tuesday.
Sharrock, 53, died Thursday of a heart attack at him home in Ossining, New  York, she said.
Sharrock played and recorded with a number of prominent American jazz  musicians, including Miles Davis, Herbie Mann, Cannonball Adderly and Pharoah  Sanders.
After asthma attacks stopped his saxophone playing, Sharrock picked up the  guitar and soon joined the avant-garde jazz movement in New York.
From 1967 to 1974 he was a regular with flutist Herbie Mann's group. In  1975, he started his own group, Sharrock, with his wife but it broke up with  their divorce in 1978.
In the 1980s he became part of the downtown New York improvisation  movement and was a regular member of the group Last Exit.
