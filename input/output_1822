Gregoire has leased a Buick-powered 1992 Lola from Dick Simon, who already  owns six cars qualified for the race.
The car has not reached competitive speeds, but Colombian-born Roberto  Guerrero has qualified a similar car for the race and the French driver has  three days of practice before the weekend's final qualifying sessions.
Crawford, Theys and Finland's Tero Palmroth are among drivers trying to  make deals for backup cars in search of a chance to qualify. But they face  stiff competition from US drivers and other international veterans.
Australia's Geoff Brabham, for instance, has struck a deal to try and  qualify a backup car for the Menard engine team, which aleady has US drivers  Eddie Cheever and Scott Brayton in the field in similar 1993 Lolas.
Sweden's Fredrik Ekblom, the youngest driver here at age 22, also might  make a late run for one of the last spots.
Crawford finds himself in a speed struggle. His 1991 Buick-powered Lola is  the oldest car in the Gasoline Alley garage area and one of the slowest here  at 209.307 mph (334.891 km/h).
"It's frustrating because something is basically wrong," Crawford said of  the car.
"We've got trouble and if we don't find the problem, it's going to be  another long weekend."
Crawford has the best deal he can afford, although he hopes something  better from the reserve cars of other teams might become available in the  final hours of time trials.
"Unfortunately, this is all we've got so we'll keep plugging away,"  Crawford said.
