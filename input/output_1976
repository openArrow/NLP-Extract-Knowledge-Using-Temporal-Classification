China denied Thursday reports it was still  exporting prison labour products to the United States in violation of  bilateral accords, saying this was "sheer fabrication."
Ending such exports was also one of the conditions laid down by Bill  Clinton for this year's renewal of China's most favoured nation trade status,  an issue on which the US president must decide by June 3.
"China has acted in strict compliance" with a 1992 memorandum of  understanding (MOU) between Beijing on Washington banning import and export of  trade in prison labour products, foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said.
In March, the two sides signed a new statement of cooperation setting out  explicit guidelines for the implemention of the MOU, following US complaints  that China had failed to observe the original agreement.
Harry Wu, a former Chinese prisoner who now heads of the US Laogai  Research Foundation, said Wednesday that during a recent two-month visit to  China he had secretly photographed and videoed prisons disguised as factories  that continued to export goods to the United States.
"This is a sheer fabrication," said Wu.
"Both the Chinese and the US sides share the view that the two documents  are being implemented smoothly. It is out of ulterior motives for a handful of  people to spread lies and make vicious slanders on this issue," he said.
