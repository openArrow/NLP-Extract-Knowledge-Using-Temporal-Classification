stable. The price of cocoa fluctuated around 950 pounds per tonne  with investment funds little interested as the market focused on coffee.
The announcement of a forthcoming discussion in the European Parliament on  the possible harmonisation of the quantity of cocoa substitutes used by the  European countries, moved prices little.
If European ministers accept in June to raise the amount of cocoa  substitute allowed in chocolate to five percent, as is currently allowed in  Ireland, Britain and Denmark, the use of cocoa by the 12 EU members will  diminish considerably.
Specialists said such a measure would cut the use of cocoa in Europe to  between 130,000 and 250,000 tonnes per year, which would represent between 10  and 20 percent of total consumption.
COFFEE: soaring higher. Coffee soared higher again, proving wrong many  specialists who had predicted profit-taking.
Prices rose by 300 dollars during the week to end at over 2,200 dollars  per tonne -- the highest level for five years. The index of the International  Coffee Organisation (IOC), which is calculated on several types of coffee, had  reached a record since February 1989.
A shortage of Colombian coffee and an extreme cut in the supply of robusta  -- which is the main type of coffee exchanged on the London market -- remained  the reasons for the rises.
Speculative buying by investment funds was also a large factor in pushing  New York prices higher. Dealers in Britain said the prices were due to  industrial buying to restock supplies.
Dealers were increasingly saying the rises could carry on for weeks, but  many said the market could drop soon on profit-taking.
