The OECD has also organized special meetings and visits to Russia on such  issues as the conversion of formerly Soviet military-industrial complexes into  civilian industries.
The basis for the OECD's relations with Russia was in fact laid as far  back as in 1989, when then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was seeking to set  the former Soviet Union to a course of economic reform.
At their meeting here next month, OECD ministers will give special  attention to the OECD's changing world role.
They are to welcome a ministerial delegation from Mexico, which became the  organization's 25th member on May 18, and may have a first round of talks on  the entry applications from the four PIT countries.
They will also review its on-going dialogue on economic issues with  dynamic Asian and Latin American nations, and are expected to discuss ways of  establishing closer links with China.
The ministers agreed last year that the OECD should "consider broadening  its knowledge and understanding" of the economies of China and other future  major players in the world economy.
Several OECD countries are eager to establish an economic dialogue with  fast-growing China, described by some speakers at last year's meeting as a  potential "future fourth pillar of the world economy," alongside North  America, Europe and Japan.
But the United States has so far opposed any institutionalized  relationship between the OECD and Beijing because of China's human rights  record.
