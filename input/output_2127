Euro Disney's creditor banks gave the green light  Thursday to a restructuring programme for the troubled theme park, agreeing to  underwrite 51 percent of a billion-dollar reinvestment package, the two lead  banks said.
The Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), together with Indosuez the lead  institutions of the 61 creditor banks, said that "with the exception of a few  banks, all the establishments have agreed to guarantee the increase in  capital, which should be in made available in June or July."
The programme, providing six billion francs (1.06 billion dollars) of  fresh funding, was signed March 14 by the representatives of banks, Euro  Disney and its parent organisation, the Walt Disney Company, which will fund  the remaining 49 percent of the package.
According to a BNP statement some creditor banks "have agreed to  underwrite more than their share, which will enable this share issue ... to  benefit from the necessary bank guarantees."
Some 85 percent of the creditor banks, which comprise 23 from France, 17  from the rest of Europe, 16 from Japan, and five from North America, agreed to  the refinancing package on April 28.
Euro Disney is soon to hold an extraordinary meeting of shareholders to  authorise the package, part of a programme to restructure the banks' Euro  Disney debt, which stands at 20.3 billion francs (3.5 billion dollars).
Between October 1993 and March 1994, Euro Disney registered a net loss of  1.055 billion francs (180 million dollars), compared with a loss of 4.288  billion francs during the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year.
