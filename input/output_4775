Two people were killed and three were  missing after a plane carrying out a medical evacuation crashed into the sea  off Tahiti early Friday, officials said here.
The Mitsubishi MU2B60 aircraft with a pilot, two doctors and two  Australian patients, crashed on its approach to Tahiti-Faaa airport after a  flight from Rarotonga, the capital of the Cook Islands, about 800 kilometers  (500 miles) West of here.
An air and sea search launched after the crash located two bodies as well  as plane's fuselage floating in the water.
The plane, belonging to the recently formed airline, Air Oceania, was  forced to make an emergency landing on its belly several months ago, after the  undercarriage failed to lower.
