An explosion and fire on a Red Sea ferry carrying  almost 600 passengers and crew killed at least three people, left 50 injured  and some 270 unaccounted for on Thursday, rescue services said.
A total of 257 people were rescued in the early hours of the morning from  the 583 on board.
Passengers escaped on life boats and were picked up by an American  warship, the USS Newport, and a merchant ship, said the officials in the  Egyptian Red Sea port of Hurghada.
The Qamar al-Saudi was travelling from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to Suez, in  Egypt, when an explosion in the engine room caused a fire which spread  rapidly, the officials said.
Most of those on board were Egyptian workers returning home for the Moslem  festival of Eid.
The blast happened just before midnight after the ferry had dropped 527  passengers at the Egyptian Red Sea port of Safaga, 600 kilometres (370 miles)  southeast of Cairo and entered the Gulf of Suez.
Rescue official Ahmed Nabil said the "fire has completely gutted the ship."
However, he said most of the passengers had managed to get off.
The Qamar-al-Saudi had already hit a reef in March in the same stretch of  water but nobody was hurt, and collided with a Norwegian ship in 1991.
In December 1991 another ferry on the same route, the Salem Express, hit a  coral reef off the Egyptian coast, officially causing the deaths of 471,  although more were believed to have been lost.
