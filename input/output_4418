The Galata bridge across the Golden Horn waterway  in Istabul, which was partially destroyed in a fire in 1992, will reopen to  traffic on Sunday after being rebuilt further upstream, Istanbul city  officials said Thursday.
The old two-tier bridge, built in 1912 at the mouth of the Golden Horn,  was one of the city's main tourist attractions.
The bridge has been restored at a cost of 4.6 million dollars but has been  moved upstream between Haskoy and Balat, the city's former Jewish quarter.
The old Galata bridge which was 462 meters (yards) in length and 25 in  width had two tiers, the upper one housing restaurants and cafes.
The restored bridge has none of these attractions and is outside the main  tourist circuit.
A new draw-bridge, said to be the biggest in the world, is already in  service at the site of the old bridge.
The new bridge was almost completed when fire destroyed the old one.
