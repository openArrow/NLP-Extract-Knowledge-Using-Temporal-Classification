Crimean forces have taken "preventive measures"  against possible strikes by Ukrainian troops but are not on a state of alert,  Interior Minister Valery Kuznetsov told the Interfax news agency Sunday.
Tension between the Crimea and the authorities in Kiev reached fever pitch  Friday when deputies in the regional legislature voted to restore a 1992  constitution tantamount to declaration of independence.
Ukrainian lawmakers retaliated by issuing a 10-day ultimatum to Crimea to  withdraw the declaration and issued vague threats that force could be used if  the secessionist republic refused.
But General Kuznetsov said Sunday there was no state of alert in Crimea  and that the situation there was "normal."
"We have only taken preventive measures," the minister said.
On Saturday Kuznetsov received reports that the Ukrainian national guard  had been ordered to take control of radio and television buildings, the  Crimean central bank, government and parliament buildings and the central  telephone exchange in the capital Simferopol, the general said.
In response he had given the order to Crimean interior ministry forces to  "increase their vigilance." Police were also guarding the television station  and parliament, he said.
"Everything will remain calm if Ukraine does not ignite the situation,"  the minister continued, adding "the Crimean people have the right to choose  freely, but within the framework of Ukraine's territorial integrity."
Kuznetsov said, "the hysteria around the Crimean parliament's decision (to  restore the 1992 constitution) is not coming from all Ukrainians but is being  stirred up by forces which want to torpedo the (Ukrainian) presidential  elections June 26."
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has been seeking for several months to  get the conservative-dominated parliament in Kiev, which opposes his policies,  to suspend the June 26 presidential elections which he is expected to lose.
