Philippine Airlines Inc. (PAL) suffered substantial  losses in fiscal 1993 and is expected to stay in the red in the first two  quarters of the current year, company officials said Thursday.
However PAL officials said they were implementing cost-cutting measures  and assured that despite months of internal conflict, they were now united in  assuring the airline's success.
"We did lose money last year," Jose Antonio Garcia, president and chief  operating officer, told a news conference after an unpredecented meeting  between management and employees.
The company was also sure to incur losses in the first and second  quarters, or between April to September 1994, said Garcia, who declined to  give figures.
Ethnic Chinese tycoon Lucio Tan, who controls the consortium which  acquired 67 percent of PAL from the government in 1992 for 10.5 billion pesos  (388.9 million dollars), said that PAL's total value was down to only nine  billion pesos from a projected 22 billion pesos.
"PAL now is like a cancer patient and is very, very serious," he told  airline employees during a meeting to rally their support, citing PAL's loses  of 220 million pesos in February.
"If we incur further losses of two billion pesos in the next 12 months,  how will PAL survive?" he asked.
The flag carrier's net income topped one billion pesos in fiscal 1992, but  was hit hard by interest charges and maintenance costs.
Tan blamed government "mismanagement" over 20 years for the airline's  present difficulties, but did not call for a change in the 14-member board, in  which the government holds six seats to the Tan group's five in a bid to  preserve unity.
