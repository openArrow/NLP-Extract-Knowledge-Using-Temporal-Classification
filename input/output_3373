Colombia's Faustino Asprilla is likely to hit the  headlines whether or not his immense talent flourishes in the World Cup.
The 24-year-old Parma striker is gifted with incredible pace, supreme  technical skill, and a goalscorers' instinct -- but that is not where interest  in Asprilla ends.
His excessive lifestyle, which has seen him drive around peaceful Parma at  80mph in his Ferrari, ensures he gets noticed away from the football pitch.  And married Asprilla has had his affairs aired in the Italian press to spice  up more juicy intrigue.
He once walked out of a Colombia training camp in a huff to further gain  the limelight, and his trademark cartwheel following a goal sets him apart as  a natural showman.
However, Asprilla's poor showing against Arsenal in the European Cup  Winners' Cup final on May 4 suggests he might have to rely on after-match  activities to gain mass press coverage in the World Cup.
Asprilla, apart from one dream chance in the first 30 seconds, was hounded  off the ball by Arsenal defenders -- the Londoners eventually won 1-0 thanks  to an Alan Smith goal.
Arsenal's rugged defence proved Asprilla's guns could be spiked and he was  vulnerable to a physical and organised defence. On that showing, surely world  class defences like the Germans' and Italians' would be able to mark him out  of the game.
