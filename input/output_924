A train carrying more than 400  people collided with a freight train before dawn Monday, killing one person  and injuring more than 60 others, authorities said.
The collision ocurred about 40 miles north of Fayetteville, North Carolina  at 4:32 a.m. (0832 GMT), Amtrak spokeswoman Pat Kelly said in Washington.
Authorities said the Amtrak Silver Meteor, which was bound for Florida  from New York, collided with a CVX freight train, sending 12 cars off the  track.
"I was thrown out of my bunk and I landed on both of my children,"  passenger Sue McGrath told a local television station. "The car was laying  over sideways."
Dick Hutchinson described the impact as "a bump and then three short  bumps. Everybody stayed relatively calm. It was terrifying."
The person killed was in the engine cab, said Richard Self, Johnston  County manager. He said 66 others were taken to a local hospital with injuries  that ranged from bruises to broken bones.
