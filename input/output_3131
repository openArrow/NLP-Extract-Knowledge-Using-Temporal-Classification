Foreign delegates will ignore a government ban on  entering the Philippines to attend a conference on East Timor, organizers said  here Monday.
Leftist activist Renato Constantino said non-Philippines delegates who  were not on a government list of foreigners barred from the country still  planned to attend the conference starting May 31.
Constantino would not identify the delegates but said they were  "international participants who do not feel they are covered by this ban."
President Fidel Ramos ordered foreigners to be stopped from going to the  event to mollify Indonesia.
Indonesia, which annexed East Timor in 1976, has pressured the Philippines  to stop the conference. Ramos said the authorities could not prevent a private  meeting although he has agreed to bar eight Timorese dissident leaders from  attending.
Constantino said the other delegates could enter the Philippines without  informing the government they would go to the conference and hinted that some  of them were already in the country.
He and other conference organizers said they would take legal action if  the government attempted to detain foreign delegates once they were already in  the country.
However he admitted that new names were being added to the list of the  eight foreigners barred from entry.
Constantino attacked Indonesia for trying to block the meeting and  assailed the Ramos government for giving in to Jakarta.
Indonesia has threatened to stop hosting peace talks between Manila and  Moslem separatists in its southern Mindinao island in retaliation for the  holding of the conference.
It has also blocked businessmen from attending a conference in the  southern Philippines this week and threatened to cancel planned Indonesian  investment. The Indonesian authorities also reportedly detained Filipino  fishermen caught on the two country's ill-defined borders.
