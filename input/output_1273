Eurotunnel shareholders voted on Tuesday to  increase a planned rights issue from 192 million shares to a maximum of 342  million shares.
At a special shareholders' meeting, Eurotunnel co-chairman Alastair Morton  said that Eurotunnel did not yet know how big the rights issue would be.
Details would be sent out "in a few weeks," he said. The price of shares  in the company fell by 22 pence or by 5.23 percent to 398 pence.
Meanwhile in Tokyo the Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted sources in London as   saying that the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. (IBJ) and Yasuda Trust and  Banking Co. Ltd. planned to extend fresh loans to Eurotunnel plc.
It said that the IBJ would extend 15 million pounds (22.5 million dollars)  in new financing while Yasuda would provide "several million" pounds.
Neither bank would comment.
The report said that most other Japanese banks were reluctant to provide  further finance because Eurotunnel had failed to meet its financial forecasts.
In Paris, a spokeswoman for Eurotunnel described as "speculation" a report  in the London Financial Times newspaper that Eurotunnel was likely to seek  about 850 million pounds (1,275 million dollars) from the rights issue.
This would be 20 percent more than the stock market had expected and would  be far more than any of its four previous equity-raising exercises.
Eurotunnel has said that it does not expect to pay a dividend to  shareholders until 2003.
Eurotunnel said on Monday that it would begin commercial operations this  week with the first trip by a freight shuttle charging fares to be made by  Thursday. The first freight trains would use the tunnel by June 13.
