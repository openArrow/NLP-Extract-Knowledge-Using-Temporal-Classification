Benfica clinched the Portuguese title here on  Wednesday with a 3-0 away win at Gil Vicente.
Joao Pinto opened the scoring as early as the third minute to set up the  win and added another after 74 minutes to go before Russian Vassili Kulkov  made sure with four minutes to go.
That gave the club a four-point lead over Bobby Robson's FC Porto, who won  1-0 at home to Farense.
The two leading sides have two games to play but Benifica are guaranteed  the title after coming out on top of their two league encounters this season.
It was Benefica's 30th national league title.
