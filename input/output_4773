The new Palestinian Authority will hold its official  swearing-in ceremony in Jericho, PLO sources said here Friday.
Originally the members of the authority were due to be sworn-in at their  first formal meeting which began late Thursday in Tunis presided over by PLO  chief Yasser Arafat.
But Arafat announced the ceremony was to be delayed until the authority  was installed in the new self-rule enclave of Jericho, the sources added.
The PLO chairman still has to complete his 24-member team, drawing closer  to the final makeup Friday with Zohdi Nashshibi, a member of the PLO executive  committee, becoming the 20th appointment.
Under the Israel-PLO autonomy accord signed in Cairo on May 4, the  authority is to be installed on May 25.
Arafat's first visit to the newly-autonomous areas of Jericho and the Gaza  Strip is expected to be a brief one, a senior PLO figure said.
He is also scheduled to take part in the Organisation of African Unity  summit in Tunis from June 13 to 15.
No exact date has yet been set for Arafat's return to the territories but  it is expected to be in mid-June.
Arafat meanwhile nominated one of his legal counsellors Qusai Othman  Abadla as president of the future Palestinian supreme court.
