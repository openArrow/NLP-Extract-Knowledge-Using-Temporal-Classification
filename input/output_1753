UN nuclear inspectors who traveled to North Korea  to determine if spent reactor fuel was diverted for bomb-making have begun  their work, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Wednesday.
A spokesman for the UN agency said the three inspectors had got down to  their week-long assignment but he refused to provide details.
North Korea said over the weekend that it had already begun replacing  spent fuel rods from a reactor at Yongbyon, 90 kilometers (54 miles) north of  Pyongyang.
The inspectors are pressing to check the rods to see if fissile material  has been diverted to make a nuclear weapon.
North Korea denies having a nuclear weapons program.
US legislators have called for sanctions against the reclusive Stalinist  government in North Korea if it goes ahead with the fuel rod change without  IAEA inspectors present.
According to the United States, the operation could yield enough plutonium  to fuel four to five nuclear bombs.
The IAEA says the operation could take a few months.
