Malawians Saturday wound up an historic election  campaign bringing multiparty politics to a country ruled for the past three  decades by President Hastings Kamuzu Banda.
The ailing president inspected troops from an open truck as some 20,000  people turned up at a stadium here to celebrate his official birthday ahead of  elections May 17, while around 50,000 attended an opposition rally.
Banda, who is officially 88 but is widely believed to be in his 90s,  underwent brain-surgery last October and recently cut short an election  campaign tour of the country because of an undisclosed leg ailment.
Reading a prepared speech with some difficulty, Banda appealed to  Malawians to conduct themselves "as ladies and gentlemen" during the  elections, which should be "free and fair."
He said the Malawi army was "committed to serve the government of the day."
Meanwhile, the bigger opposition rally was addressed by the presidential  challenger favoured to win the elections, Bakili Muluzi of the United  Democratic Front (UDF).
He predicted that his party, with a strong base in the densely-populated  south of the country, would win the elections.
The UDF is the only opposition party that has fielded candidates for the  presidency and all 177 parliamentary seats.
Muluzi said Banda's government had done "nothing" to develop Malawi, while  his party would strive to fulfill its election promises, including free  education.
"There is a lot of poverty in this country. We want to change that and  make Malawi a prosperous nation," he said.
Earlier, Banda said in an address on national radio that his work of  ruling Malawi was not yet finished.
He said he and his ruling Malawi Congress Party had the experience and  skills necessary to face the "challenges and dangers" ahead of the country.
Banda, accused of serious human rights abuses during his rule, said his  government would respect human rights and uphold good and accountable  government.
