Relegated English Premier League  club Sheffield United stayed off the beer long enough to draw the final match  of their Australian football tour here on Saturday 1-1 with the Australian  Olympic team.
Welsh international Nathan Blake put Sheffield ahead in the 25th minute,  heading home a great cross from the right by Mitch Ward, after the English  side had missed a string of good chances.
Swiss-based striker Paul Agostino, who plays for Young Boys Berne,  equalised for the Australians with an 84th minute goal.
"We should have won the game," United coach Dave Bassett said. "We should  have had the game wrapped up at half-time."
Bassett said the standard of his team's play in the final match should  have dispelled stories that they were only in Australia for an end-of-season  holiday.
The Sheffield team had won their first match 2-1 against Western Australia  in Perth before losing comprehensively 3-0 to Australian club champions  Adelaide City and drawing 1-1 with Northern New South Wales.
"We have been fairly committed. But in fairness, we've haven't had the  boys completely off the beer since we've been over here," said Bassett.
The Sheffield United party will now spend five days holidaying under the  Gold Coast sun before returning home later this week.
