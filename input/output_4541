Indonesian censors have approved the showing of  the award-winning film "Schindler's List," but with cuts, an official said  Friday.
Director Steven Spielberg has said the film must be shown uncut or not at  all.
The censors were under pressure from Moslem organizations which wanted the  film barred from the country, and approving the film with cuts will keep it  out of the country unless Spielberg changes his mind.
Censorship Board Executive Director Sukanto said that the board, at its  plenary meeting, decided to cut scenes containing nudity and violence from the  film about a group of Jews saved from a Nazi death camp by a war profiteer.
Sukanto said the board did not consider whether the film propagates  Zionism in deciding to cut it.
Moslem organizations here, including the nation's highest Islamic  authority, the Indonesian Council of Ulemas, and The Committee for World  Moslem Solidarity (Kisdi), said that the film was Jewish propaganda and as  such would be harmful to Indonesian Moslems.
Kisdi chairman Sumargono said he was surprised that the board approved  "Schindler's List," even with cuts, and threatened protests by Moslems against  the film's importers if it is shown here.
Indonesia, which backs the Palestinians against the Israelis, is the  world's most populous Moslem nation. Eighty-eight percent of Indonesia's 186  million people are Moslems.
"Schindler's List" won seven Oscars, including those for best picture,  best director and best screenplay adaptation.
