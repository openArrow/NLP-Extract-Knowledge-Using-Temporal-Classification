India is ready to talk to Moslem militants to  end the four-year-old separatist camaign in Kashmir, but Pakistan cannot be  included in the negotiations, a federal minister said here on Sunday.
Internal Security Minister Rajesh Pilot told the Press Trust of India  (PTI) news agency that New Delhi had "an open mind on holding talks with  anybody if it helps to bring back normalcy in Kashmir."
But Pilot rejected suggestions from a top Kashmiri militant leader, Yasin  Malik, that New Delhi should start an unconditional dialogue with Kashmiris  and Pakistan if it wanted peace in the northern state.
"The talks should be among ourselves," Pilot said, referring to India and  to Moslem militants in Kashmir fighting for the secession of the state, the  only one with a Moslem majority. Pilot ruled out the inclusion of "any third  party."
It was the first Indian reaction to Saturday's offer by Malik of the Jammu  and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) that separatist unrest could end in  Kashmir if India talked unconditionally to Kashmiris and Pakistan.
Indian newspapers on Sunday quoted Malik as saying in Srinagar, the summer  capital of Kashmir, that his outlawed JKLF would announce a unilateral truce  if New Delhi agreed to the negotiations.
Indian leaders have said the guerrillas must renounce violence before  talks can start. But Malik, 30, freed on May 16 after nearly four years in  prison, said: "You cannot talk of peace and then make any move toward it  conditional."
Malik, who returned to Kashmir two days after his release, said the JKLF,  the premier Moslem guerrilla group, stood for the "total independence" of  Kashmir, now divided between India and Pakistan.
"The Kashmir issue is not merely a territorial dispute between India and  Pakistan," he declared. According to Indian newspapers he denied that the  Kashmiri separatist campaign, in which nearly 10,000 have lost their lives,  aimed to carve out an independent state exclusively for Moslems.
"We do not demand freedom for a particular community or a particular area.  We strive for total independence of the 13 million Kashmiris, irrespective of  their caste, colour, race, region or faith.
"The independence of Kashmir means the independence of the 85,000 square  miles (136,000 square kilometers) that constitute our homeland," he said,  making clear he meant both the two-thirds of the state within India and the  rest held by Pakistan.
India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars since 1947 over    Kashmir. New Delhi accuses Islamabad of arming the militant groups, which  Pakistan denies.
All Moslem separatist groups except the JKLF want the Indian-held Kashmir  to join Pakistan.
Other Moslem groups want to make Kashmir an Islamic state, and have forced  thousands of Hindus who have lived in the Kashmir valley for generations to  flee. Malik said he wanted the Hindus to return.
Malik, who helped launch the Kashmiri separatist campaign in 1989, was  arrested by Indian security forces in Srinagar in August 1990 and held in  prison until last week.
