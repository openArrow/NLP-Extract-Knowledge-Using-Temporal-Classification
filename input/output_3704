The White House confirmed Tuesday that  President Bill Clinton will hold the first State dinner of his administration  when Japanese Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko visit next month.
"Certainly, I think it is an indication of how important this relationship  is," White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers told a news briefing when asked  about arrangements for the Washington leg of the 10-city, two-week tour  staring on June 10.
She said that the United States had worked hard to have a mature  relationship with the Japanese on a number of issues citing security, global  and economic ties.
"I think the Emperor and his wife probably may very well not be back here,  so it is an opportunity for us to have a State dinner," Myers said.
The first visit to the United States by a Japanese emperor since 1975 has  already created a stir at home over plans for him to go to Pearl Harbour at  the end of the trip.
Japanese press reports said earlier this week that the plans had been  cancelled amid protests from conservatives who say that Japan has nothing to  apologize for, although this has yet to be officially confirmed.
