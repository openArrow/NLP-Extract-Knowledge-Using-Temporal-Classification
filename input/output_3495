At least five people were killed and more than 20  injured in an hour-long gun battle between two Shiite Moslem parties here,  party and hospital sources said Tuesday.
The shooting erupted around sunset Monday between troops of the  Harakat-i-Islami party and the Hezb-i-Wahdat, which is dominated by the ethnic  Hazara minority and based in the northern Kabul suburb of Wazir Abad.
Harakat commander Ali Anwari blamed the Wahdat faction for attacking a  security post in Wazir Abad mosque, adding that "they were defeated" in their  attempt to capture the post.
Both factions are religiously and ideologically of the same origin, but  tension has prevailed between them since the failed military coup staged by  Uzbek general Abdul Rashid Dostam against President Burhanuddin Rabbani at the  beginning of the year.
The Harakat leadership has been siding with Rabbani, while Wahdat, under  the leadership of Abdul Ali Mazari, has recently given its support to rival  Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and his former communist allies.
Sources said forces loyal to Rabbani also took part in the one-hour clash  and bombarded Wahdat positions.
