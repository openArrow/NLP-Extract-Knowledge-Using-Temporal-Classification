The first World Conference on Natural Disaster  Reduction opened in Yokohama Monday with experts and officials from 130  nations gathering to discuss measures to reduce damage and casualties from  catastrophes.
Nearly 2,000 officials and experts gathered for the five-day UN-sponsored  event to discuss preventive measures and alert systems to save lives during  natural disasters.
According to UN estimates, four million people have perished since the  beginning of the century in natural disasters, which still claim many lives in  the Asia region.
They cited a 1977 cyclone in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh which  killed 10,000 people and a similar storm which hit the region in 1990, in  which only 710 people were killed after an alert had been issued.
Flooding causes the most damage and claims the most victims in the world,  followed in order by tropical storms, drought and earthquakes.
From 1963 to 1992, Asia was the worst-hit continent, with the number of  disasters claiming at least 100 lives reaching 218 in South Asia, 123 in East  Asia, and 39 in Southeast Asia and Australia.
The United Nations, by comparison, documented 113 such disasters in Africa  over the same period.
The cost of catastrophes has tripled in 30 years -- especially in  developing countries -- with an increase in incidence and damage. Natural  disasters were responsible for 40 billion dollars in property damages from  1960-69, 70 billion dollars from 1970-79 and 120 billion dollars from 1980-89.
