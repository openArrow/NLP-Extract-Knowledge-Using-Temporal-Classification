Fighting between Rwandan rebels and government  forces intensified Sunday in several districts of Kigali and in towns across  the country, a UN spokesman in the capital said.
Abdul Kabia, a spokesman for the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR)  contacted by telephone from here, reported heavy clashes between the Rwandan  Patriotic Front (RPF) and government troops in the eastern and southeastern  suburbs of Remera and Kicukiro.
Mortar shells also fell in the centre of the capital, he said.
Fighting between the Tutsi-led RPF and the Hutu-majority government side  was also raging in Ruhengeri, a northwest town still held by the regular army,  and at Nkumba further to the north, Kabia said. Clashes were also reported at  Bugesera, south of Kigali.
The RPF claimed on Friday it had won control of half the country.
Kabia added that Dutch Cooperation Minister Jan Pronk arrived in the  capital Saturday on a short visit, inspecting the Amaharo stadium and the  Meridien hotel, two refugee centres.
Former French minister for humanitarian action Bernard Kouchner, who  called Saturday on the international community to help avert "genocide" in the  country, was still in Kigali Sunday, Kabia said.
Rwanda was plunged back into a murderous ethnic war on April 7, a day  after Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in what the government  denounced as a rocket attack on his plane.
Since then an estimated 200,000 Rwandans have been killed and around  500,000 others have fled to neighbouring countries.
