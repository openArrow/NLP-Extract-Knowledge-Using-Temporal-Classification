Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has urged his  people to shun Western political systems saying they could lead his country to  turmoil if adopted.
Museveni has repeatedly expressed his dislike of multi-party politics, but  a newly elected constituent assembly includes opposition members, although the  president's National Resistance Movement (NRM) has a majority.
"We should develop our own systems that spring from our social and  cultural uniqueness," Museveni told the opening session of the assembly on  Wednesday.
The assembly is expected to ratify a draft constitution and vote on  whether Uganda is to return to multi-party politics, after eight years of  one-party rule by the NRM.
"In industrialised societies, a constitution is made to run a country, but  in developing countries like Uganda, constitutions should be made to build and  consolidate a country," Museveni said.
Museveni said tribalism was the bane of Africa saying it was the major  cause of upheaval in the continent.
"As long as we contineu thinking ourselves as members of those narrow  blocs (tribes), African states will continue to be centres of upheaval," the  president added.
