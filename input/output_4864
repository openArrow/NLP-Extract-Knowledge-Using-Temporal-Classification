US President Bill Clinton has urged France to keep  its troops in Bosnia-Hercegovina until all possibilities for peace in the  former Yugoslav republic have been exhausted.
Clinton, in a radio interview broadcast early Saturday by France Inter and  France Info, acknowledged that the French government might not want to  maintain forces in Bosnia if they were to become targets in the fighting.
But according to a French translation of his remarks, he said he hoped  French troops would be able to "stay at least until we have exhausted all  possibilities for reaching a peace settlement."
"I think there's a chance that we can reach that point, when the two sides  realize they can't go on fighting into the next century without ever finding a  solution on the battlefield."
France currently has the largest United Nations contingent in Bosnia,  3,728 men, followed by Britain, with 2,002, and Malaysia, with 1,492.
