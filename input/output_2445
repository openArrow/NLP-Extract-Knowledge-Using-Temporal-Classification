Martina Navratilova, who at 37 will retire at the  end of this year, was dealt no favours on Friday at the draw for next week's  French Open Tennis Championships at the Roland Garros Stadium.
The fourth-ranked left-handed American, dreaming to repeat her 1982 and  1984 success on the surface least suited to her aggressive game, found herself  drawn into an over-heavy, top-half of the women's singles draw and on course  for a semi-final showdown with defending champion Steffi Graf.
Navratilova, who also has Japan's Kimiko Date in her quarter of the draw  as well as dangerous home hope Mary Pierce, opens her 12th and final campaign  on the red clay courts of the newly-enlarged Stadium to the west of Paris,  against Miriam Oremans of the Netherlands.
But she could then find herself under pressure as early as the second  round when she is expected to face the much-improved Sabine Appelmans of  Belgium.
But if Navratilova's road to the last four is frought with danger, Graf  will also need to be vigilant.
The 24-year-old German player, who like Pete Sampras in the men's singles  is bidding for an out-of-sequence 'Grand Slam' by winning her fourth  consecutive major title, looks set for a quarter-final showdown against old  rival Gabriela Sabatini. But first she will have to beat the player she faced  in the 1993 -- Mary Joe Fernandez.
Other dangerous players in her quarter include Naoko Sawamatsu of Japan,  the experienced Helena Sukova and Croatian teenager Iva Majoli.
Former world number-one Tracy Austin, who played her last Grand Slam  tournament in Paris eleven years ago, is also in the top-half of the draw.
Austin, now 31 and making a comeback after a decade of injury and absence,  plays Markete Kochta of Germany in the first round.
