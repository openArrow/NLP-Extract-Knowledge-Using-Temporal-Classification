Vietnam denied Thursday that a leading political  dissident was on a hunger strike to protest harsh prison treatment.
The US Human Rights/Asia Watch organisation said Tuesday that professor  Doan Viet Hoat went began a hunger strike in April after being put in chains  at a reeducation camp in northern Vietnam for refusing forced labour.
A foreign ministry spokesman said Thursday that Hoat was not on hunger  strike, had not been forced to work and had not been treated any differently  than other prisoners.
But the spokesman confirmed that Hoat, former vice-rector of the Van Anh  Buddhist University, had been transferred to another prison camp closer to the  Laos border.
"This is a normal transfer under Vietnamese law," he told AFP.
Asia Watch maintains that the camp, Thanh Cam, is for hardened criminals.
Hoat, who suffers from serious kidney problems, was being held in Ba Sao  prison camp, south of Hanoi, before his transfer. Asia Watch expressed concern  for his health since he had been put in chains. It also said Hoat's wife had  been refused permission to see him.
The spokesman said the reports were untrue and maintained that Hoat was in  normal health.
Hoat was jailed for 15 years in July 1993 for activities "violating  Vietnam's penal code."
On Tuesday, Hanoi denied reports that four Buddhist monks, jailed  following violent incidents in Hue a year ago, were on hunger strike at a  reeducation camp in the southwest.
