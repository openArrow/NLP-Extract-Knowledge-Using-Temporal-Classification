Two researchers were badly hurt in an explosion at  Russia's nuclear centre at Sneyinsk (formerly Chelyabinsk-70) in the Urals,  ITAR-TASS quoted the site's deputy director as saying Monday.
The explosion occurred last Friday during an attempt to bring  decommissioned oil wells back on stream, but was said not to have caused any  radioactive leak.
Ten grams of an unidentified chemical substance exploded, injuring the two  researchers, whose lives were not believed to be in danger.
The centre's vice-director said the accident happened well away from the  site's nuclear reactors and the machinery concerned did not contain any  radioactive substances.
