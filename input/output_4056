Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali  said Wednesday he was ready to mediate in the kidnapping by Israel of a  Lebanese fundamentalist guerrilla chief.
An airborne Israeli commando unit snatched Mustafa Dirani from his home on  Saturday to question him about missing airman Ron Arad, whose plane was shot  down over south Lebanon in 1986 during an Israeli bombing raid.
Butros-Ghali said he had discussed his offer with Israeli foreign minister  Shimon Peres.
"I cannot play a role of mediator unless the two parties accept this. I  know that Lebanon reserves its rights to consult the Security Council, but it  has not done this until now," Boutros-Ghali added.
Asked by an Arab journalist if the act was justifiable, the UN chief said:  "I have to play a role of good offices, of mediator; it is better not to say  what is my position."
