Bosnian Serbs regard the Posavina corridor as a vital strategic link  between the territory they control in western Bosnia and Serbia proper.
The proposal by the international community to grant 49 percent of Bosnian  territory to the Serbs amounted to "a reward for aggression and ethnic  cleansing," Zubak charged.
Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic said that the 58 percent claimed by the  federation comprised 55 percent of Bosnia proper plus three percent comprised  by the Sarajevo conurbation, excluding the Serb stronghold of Pale located  just outside Sarajevo.
The federal territory would have 2.84 million inhabitants, of whom 52.4  percent would be Moslems, 24.1 percent Croats, and 11.9 percent Serbs.
These would comprise 77.8 percent of all Moslems living in Bosnia, 90.1  percent of all Croats, and 35.2 percent of all Serbs, he said.
Silajdzic stressed that the federation was not reserved for Moslems and  Croats and reaffirmed his "permanent appeal" to the Serbs to join the  federation on the same basis."
The assembly, on its second and final day Tuesday, is to ratify the Vienna  agreement and approve the nomination of Zubak as the federation's president,  along with that of Silajdzic as prime minister.
The establishment of these institutions does not affect the existence of  those of the republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina, of which Izetbegovic continues to  be president.
