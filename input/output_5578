The Niger government will return to talks with the  armed Tuareg opposition in two weeks, spokesman Moctar Diallo said late  Monday, several days after fresh rebel attacks.
The talks, to be held in Paris from June 14 to 17, will be under the  auspices of a mediation "troika" of France, Algeria and Burkino-Faso, he said.
The announcement came five days after an attack by the rebel Tuareg Armed  Resistance Coordination (CRA) on a uranium mine in Arlit, 800 kilometres (500  miles) northeast of the capital Niamey.
The incident was the latest in a new wave of violence that has left 30  dead since the suspension of talks between the two sides in February. A total  of 129 people have died since the rebellion started at the end of 1991,  according to an official tally.
The CRA is claiming autonomy for the 750,000-strong Tuareg community,  which makes up 10 percent of Niger's total population. Niamey has said it will  only accept an "advanced devolution" of power in favour of regional  governments.
