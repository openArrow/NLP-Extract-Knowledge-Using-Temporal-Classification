China will overtake Japan to become the world's  biggest steel producer this year, but out-dated technology and poor efficiency  will prevent the country becoming a "steel power," a report said Sunday.
Annual output is forecast to jump 5.7 percent over 1993 to 93 million  tonnes, enabling China to achieve a target set in the early days of the  communist rule, the China Daily Business Weekly said.
Japan's annual output is expected to drop to between 90 and 92 million  tonnes, it said, adding that China's production in the first quarter hit 22.94  million tonnes compared with 22.48 million tonnes in Japan.
"China will surely become the world's largest steel producer this year and  will keep that status in coming years," Vice Minister of the Metallurgical  Industry Zhou Chuandian said, forecasting that output would hit 160 million  tons by 2000.
Last year, China displaced the United States from its position as the  second biggest steel producer.
Despite the successes in boosting output, more than half the 100 steel  products urgently needed in China are in short supply, said Zhou, urging a  shift in policy from quantity to catching up with competitors in terms of  variety and quality.
A low continuous-casting capacity -- accounting for 34 percent of output  compared with 90 percent elsewhere -- means that China can convert only 83  percent of its crude steel into rolled steel.
Japan and the United States can convert 95 percent of output.
Poor efficiency among Chinese steel workers -- who each produce 24 tonnes  of steel annually compared to 500 tonnes for Japanese workers -- is another  problem, as is the fact that some 75 percent of equipment in Chinese factories  dates from the 1950s and 1960s.
