Iran has denied a US newspaper report that it  secretly delivered a planeload of arms to Moslems and Croats fighting the  Serbs in Bosnia, the official news agency IRNA reported Saturday.
"The allegations by the American daily that Iran has sent arms to Bosnia  are false," the Iranian embassy in Croatia said, quoted by IRNA.
The Washington Post reported Friday that a planeload of arms was delivered  earlier this month.
But IRNA, quoting Croatian officials in Zagreb, said the load comprised of  humanitarian aid such as rice, flour, sugar and cooking oil, which was  delivered to a Moslem charity in Bosnia.
The Post, quoting Western and Moslem sources in Sarajevo, said a Boeing  747 landed at Zagreb airport on May 4 to deliver 40 containers with an  estimated 60 tonnes of explosives, detonators and raw material for mortars.
One-third of the load was allegedly delivered to Croatia and the rest  transported by government trucks to the Moslems in Bosnia.
Iran, a stauch supporter of Moslems in their battle against the Serbs in  Bosnia-Hercegovina, has lobbied hard for the Moslems to be exempted from the  UN arms embargo on the former Yugoslavia.
