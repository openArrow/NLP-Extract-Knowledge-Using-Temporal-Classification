Commodity prices acted as if on a roller-coaster  this week, soaring at the beginning of the week on speculative buying before  slumping later as traders took profits.
Coffee was the most dramatic example, as prices reached their highest  point for seven years on Tuesday, before plunging 300 dollars per tonne in two  days as speculators couldn't sell fast enough.
Cocoa followed the same path, rising to its highest level since 1988,  before plummeting. Sugar, again, trod the same road but rose at the end of the  week as India announced it was to import 850,000 tonnes to cover a shortage.
The base metals, particularly copper and nickel, also climbed the mountain  at the beginning of the week, reaching respectively 16-month and 19-month  highs, aided by physical tightness in copper and threats of a strike in nickel.
The precious metals followed the rule with silver again courted by US  investment funds for the first time in two months.
Oil was one of the few items to escape the speculative fever, but analysts  said prices predated the movement with rises last week.
