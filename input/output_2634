The United States Friday welcomed a ceasefire  announced in Yemen, but had no immediate comment on the late declaration of an  independent state in South Yemen.
The State Department called a three-day ceasefire announced for midday  Saturday a "good first step in bringing an end to the conflict which has  engulfed Yemen and in reconciling all parts of the country."
The statement was issued as the south's leader Ali Salem al-Baid  proclaimed the creation of the Yemeni Democratic Republic as an independent  state with its capital in Aden.
Julie Reside, a State Department spokeswoman, said late Friday that  Washington continued to support efforts for "an immediate cessation of  hostilities" in Yemen.
The two sides, locked in a political crisis since October 1993, have been  at war since May 5.
