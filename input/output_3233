Polish police began a rare hunt Monday after two  lionesque beasts were spotted in a forest close to Gostynin, 120 kilometres  northwest of Warsaw, a puzzled police source said.
The two males, one elderly, one young, were seen in the morning by a  farmer who alerted the local law officers. A patrol, armed with a rifle and  tranquiliser darts, found animal tracks and identified them as those of two  lions.
To date, the lions -- not a natural part of the Polish fauna -- have not  been reported elsewhere and no-one is known to have been attacked.
Police said the beasts must have escaped from a zoo or circus. The zoo at  Plock, 30 kilometres (20 miles) outside Gostynin, said it had not spotted any  absentees.
