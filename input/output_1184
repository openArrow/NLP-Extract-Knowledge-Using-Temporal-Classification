Iran condemned on Tuesday the granting of a  literary award to British author Salman Rushdie in Vienna, saying it was an  insult to Islam.
Foreign ministry spokesman, Mahmud Mohammadi, blasted the move as an  insult to "all Moslems and followers of other religions."
"The prize was a basis for more disrespect to the divine religions," he  said, quoted by the Iranian news agency.
The European prize for literature, which was awarded to Rushdie in 1992,  was handed over to him on Monday by Austrian Minister for Education and  Culture Rudolf Scholten.
Rushdie has been living in hiding since he was condemned to death by the  late Iranian spiritual guide Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini for allegedly  blaspheming Islam in his novel "The Satanic Verses."
The decision of a jury of Austrian authors to award Rushdie the prize was  kept secret for a year because the authorities in Vienna said they could not  ensure his security there.
The government finally reconsidered its position under public pressure.
