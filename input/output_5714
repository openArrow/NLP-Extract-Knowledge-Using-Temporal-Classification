Cameroon's application for membership is up for consideration at the next  Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Auckland next fall, based upon  delivery on commitments to democratization and human rights improvement.
Anyaoku said the Commonwealth also remained concerned that two of its  members, Sierra Leone and his own native Nigeria, remained military  dictatorships.
"I suppose they will have taken good note of what has happened in South  Africa," he said, "and will know that the Commonwealth remains ready to help  them in every conceivable way to democratize as they say they are committed to  doing."
Anyaoku said the lifting of the stigma of apartheid and return to the  Commonwealth would allow South Africans to travel freely to other member  nations "without anyone looking at their passports with suspicion and evident  disapproval.
"I believe the people of South Africa will now find themselves  welcome...in a way that was not the case until recently."
He said South Africa's membership dues in the Commonwealth would be about  350,000 pounds (500,000 dollars) a year, in addition to voluntary  contributions it makes to the group's various funds and agencies.
Resumption of South Africa's membership will be marked, he said, at a  multi-faith service in London's Westminster Abbey on July 20, to be attended  by Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Queen Elizabeth II, the Prince of Wales and officials of the new South  African government would attend a garden reception at Marlborough House, the  Commonwealth's headquarters, later that day, he said.
