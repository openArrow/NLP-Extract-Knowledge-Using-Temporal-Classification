The situation in Algeria where the authorities  "demonised" Islamic fundamentalists shows it is better to bring them into the  political process, the International Institute of Strategic Studies said in a  report published on Monday.
The annual report of the London-based think tank included a lengthy  chapter on what it called "political Islam" in which it said Algeria should be  a lesson to other North African countries and to the West not to sideline the  fundamentalists.
"Governments under deomestic pressure from Islamic opposition groups  appeal to Western fears of 'fundamentalism' either to emphasise their claims  to western economic aid and/or to avoid the challenges of democratisation,"  the IISS said.
It added: "The crisis in Algeria will affect other states in the region  where Islamic groups have emerged on the back of social and economic  discontent."
The IISS said certain southern European countries like France, Spain and  Italy were particularly apprehensive about an "Islamist takeover" in North  Africa which could spark a wave of immigration into Europe.
In fact, the IISS said the Arab countries which had "caused particular  problems in recent years" for the west were Iraq and Libya, both of which were  secular states.
The IISS praised Jordan where fundamentalists were allowed to take part in  elections - a fact which had limited their influence, it said.
"Ruling elites in North Africa have demonised Islamists as a pretext for  disenfranchising the mainstream and for stalling on democratisation...
"The lesson of Algeria is that preserving the status-quo is not synonymous  with stability and that stability is best served by integrating Islamists into  the political process instead of criminalising them.
"Their message and popular influence are a political reality which,  whatever the dilemma it poses for the west, must be recognised and  accomodated," the ISS said.
