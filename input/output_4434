"I have decided that the United States should renew Most Favored Nation  trading status toward China. This decision, I believe, offers us the best  opportunity to lay the basis for long-term sustainable progress in human  rights and for the advancement of our other interests with China.
"Extending MFN will avoid isolating China and instead will permit us to  engage the Chinese with not only economic contacts but with cultural,  educational and other contacts, and with a continuing aggressive effort in  human rights -- an approach that I believe will make it more likely that China  will play a responsible role, both at home and abroad.
"I am moving, therefore, to delink human rights from the annual extension  of Most Favored Nation trading status for China. That linkage has been  constructive during the past year, but I believe, based on our aggressive  contacts with the Chinese in the past several months, that we have reached the  end of the usefulness of that policy, and it is time to take a new path toward  the achievement of our constant objectives. We need to place our relationship  into a larger and more productive framework.
"In view of the continuing human rights abuses, I am extending the  sanctions imposed by the United States as a result of the events in Tiananmen  Square. And I am also banning the import of munitions, principally guns and  ammunition, from China. I am also pursuing a new and vigorous American program  to support those in China working to advance the cause of human rights and  democracy. This program will include increased broadcasts for Radio Free Asia  and the Voice of America, increased support for non-governmental organizations  working on human rights in China, and the development, with American business  leaders, of a voluntary set of principles for business activity in China."
