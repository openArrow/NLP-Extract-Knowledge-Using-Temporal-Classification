India's ruling Congress (I) party Saturday won  two provincial seats in this week's by-elections, and was ahead in five  federal parliamentary constituencies, officials said as initial results  emerged.
But the Congress, led by Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, was trailing  behind the divided opposition in three of five other provincial seats where  ballot counting was in progress, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
Millions voted in 12 of India's 25 states on Thursday in by-elections seen  as a mild test of strength for the Congress party, ahead of elections in 10  states in late this year and in early 1995.
The polls were held to fill seven parliamentary and 10 state assembly  seats.
Congress candidates were on Saturday declared elected to the local  legislatures in the northern hill state of Himachal Pradesh, and the  far-eastern state of Nagaland, defeating the opposition by narrow margins.
PTI said the party's nominees were also leading in five parliamentary  constituencies as the counting of votes that began early on Saturday  continued. One of the seats is located in Rao's home state of Andhra Pradesh.
But the Congress was on the winning track only in two of five other state  assembly seats, trailing in the other three to a Tamil party and communists,  officials were quoted as saying.
No trends were available from the other constituencies.
The outcome would have no bearing on existing political equations at the  centre -- where the Congress has been in power since 1991 -- and in states  ruled by Rao's party or the opposition.
By-elections were also to have been held on Thursday in Uttar Pradesh,  India's most populous state ruled by a socialist alliance, but were  rescheduled for next week.
