Russian writer and dissident Alexander  Solzhenitsyn left his isolated New England refuge Wednesday to return to  Russia, 20 years after being ordered into exile.
The 75-year-old Nobel laureate and his wife Natalia will fly to the former  Soviet Union via Anchorage, Alaska and enter eastern Russia first. They are  not expected in the Russia's Pacific port of Vladivostok until Friday.
As the two cars carrying Solzhenitsyn and his family left the compound,  the caravan paused at the property line for a moment to give the former  dissident a last look at his home of nearly two decades.
He declined to answer questions posed by reporters gathered outside.
Solzhenitsyn was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1974 after the  authorized publication abroad of "The Gulag Archipelago," an account of his  experiences in Soviet labor camps.
