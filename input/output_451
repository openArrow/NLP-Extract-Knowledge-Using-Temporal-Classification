Vietnamese state firms unable to pay their debts  will soon be brought before special economic courts, a directive from the  prime minister published Saturday said.
Insolvent state companies which fail to pay up by July 1 will face the  courts under a bankruptcy law introduced last year, Premier Vo Van Kiet's  order published in the Party daily Nhan Dan said.
He appealed to beleaguered firms to "speed up the repayment of their debts  in order to reestablish financial discipline and create normal conditions for  the operation of state enterprises."
Under the new bankruptcy legislation, state firms must settle debts they  have incurred, even if it means digging into their assets and capital to do so.
Company heads who flout the law are liable to both judicial and  administrative sanctions.
The directive also applies to companies which have already been disbanded.
State and foreign creditors are owed nearly a billion dollars, according  to official statistics. So far endebted firms have paid back only 50 million  dollars.
A radical restructuring of the public sector in Vietnam has halved the  number of state enterprises to 6,000 over the last four years.
