The foreign ministers of Russia, the United States  and five western European countries called Friday for a four-month ceasefire  in Bosnia-Hercegovina and negotiations between the warring parties in two  weeks.
A communique issued at the end of their five-hour meeting called for a  peace agreement based on a European Union proposal to divide the former  Yugoslav republic on the basis of 51 percent for a federation of Moslems and  Croats, and 49 percent for Serbs.
The ministers from the United States, Russia, Germany, Britain, France,  Belgium and Greece also condemned recent Serb attacks against Gorazde, a  Moslem enclave in the east which the United Nations had declared a "safe area."
