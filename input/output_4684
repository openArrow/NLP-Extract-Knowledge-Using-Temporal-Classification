The Norwegian government on Friday formally proposed  November 28 as the date for the referendum on membership of the European  Union.
The proposal needs formal approval by parliament, and most observers  believe that the date will be finally fixed before summer recess.
Norway is still deeply split on the issue of EU membership, and the  government hopes that a yes-vote both in Finland and Sweden will help sway the  population.
Recent polls showed that almost 55 percent of the Norwegians rejected the  membership idea, while 34 percent were in favour and the rest is still  undecided.
Finland has set October 16 for its referendum, while Sweden has picked  November 13 for its vote. Austria, the fourth applicant country, will decide  on June 12.
The four countries aim to join the European Union on January 1, 1995.
