The Japanese government submitted to parliament  Tuesday a 40-day extension of a stop-gap budget for the current fiscal year  which began April 1, officials said.
The government of former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa was forced to  draft a 50-day provisional budget, which will expire May 20, due to political  turmoil and the stalling of the national budget for 1994.
The new 40-day extension worth 10.89 trillion yen (104.3 billion dollars)  was endorsed at an extraordinary cabinet meeting Wednesday for immediate  submission to parliament.
If passed by parliament, the two provisional budgets for 1994, worth a  total 21.94 trillion yen, would be the longest budgetary stop-gap measures  taken since 1955.
