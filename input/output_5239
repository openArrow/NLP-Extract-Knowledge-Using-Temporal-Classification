A 10th-place finish at the Indianapolis 500 was just not enough racing for  John Andretti on Sunday.
The nephew of former Indy 500 and Formula One champion Mario Andretti  departed here quickly after the 500-mile 800 km) race so he could drive in a  600-mile (960 km) NASCAR event later Sunday night.
Andretti, whose father is Mario's brother Aldo, caught a helicopter to  avoid the traffic jam caused by 500,000 spectators leaving the speedway. He  flew to the airport for a charter plane to Charlotte, North Carolina, for the  World 600 stock car race in the popular US series. (AFP)
