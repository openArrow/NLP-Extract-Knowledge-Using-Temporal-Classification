The action was non-stop and Mark Hateley fired a free kick over the bar  before Stuart McCall booted clear a Brian Welsh header from a corner.
At the other end Brewster headed over from a Dailly cross, another Dailly  centre aimed at Brewster was smothered by Maxwell and then Dailly headed wide.
In the 40th minute Alexei Mikhailichenko was denied by Guido Van de Kamp  from close in and then Maxwell brilliantly saved a fierce Brewster drive.
Brewster made amends two minutes after the break with his goal and from  then on it was mostly Rangers and a question of whether United could hang on.
Van de Kamp saved superbly from Mikhailichenko in the 55th minute from a  McCall cross then the Ukrainian shot into the side netting.
United had a scare when a powerful Hateley shot squirmed under Van de  Kamp's body but he recovered in time to grab the ball at the second attempt.
Rangers brought on former United striker Duncan Ferguson, free to play in  the final after appealing against his record 12 match suspension, for Ally  McCoist but he could make little difference.
