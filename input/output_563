Former spokeswoman for the PLO's negotiating  team Hanan Ashrawi has refused to participate in the 24-strong Palestinan  Authority for Gaza and Jericho, Israeli television said late Saturday.
According to the television, she has told Palestine Liberation  Organisation leader Yasser Arafat that she would prefer to retain her duties  as head of an organisation to defend civil rights in the occupied territories  rather than be a member of the new self-rule authority.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was given a partial list of names of  the 15 members of the new body on Thursday including Ashrawi.
PLO chief negotiator Nabil Shaath said the authority would be ready to  take up its duties on Wednesday.
Israeli television said Arafat had appointed two other members Saturday --  Nablus businessman Munib al-Masri and university professor Sari Nussiebeh.
The appointments were formally approved in Tunis at a meeting of the PLO's  executive commitee which also nominated Yasser Abed Rabbo, head of the PLO's  information department, to the authority, a committee member Mohammed Zohdi  Nashashibi told AFP in Tunis.
However, sources close to Rabbo said he had not given his formal approval  to his nomination and had asked for time to think about it.
