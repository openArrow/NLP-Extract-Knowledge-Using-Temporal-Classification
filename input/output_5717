Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Mussa said Tuesday he will  meet his Iranian counterpart Ali Akbar Velayati, in the first such encounter  since diplomatic ties between Egypt and Iran were cut in 1979.
But Mussa told AFP the time for the meeting had not yet been set.
Mussa personally welcomed Velayati following an economic session at the  Non-Aligned Movement's ministerial meeting which opened in Cairo Tuesday.
An Iranian foreign ministery spokesman, Murtada Sermihy, said Monday that  Velayati was in Cairo solely to attend the NAM meeting, and would not be  seeing any Egyptian officials.
Sermihi added that there were no new developments in Egyptian-Iranian  relations, saying "the situation was still as it was between the two  countries."
The government that took power in Tehran after the 1979 Islamic revolution  severed ties with Cairo because of Egypt's peace pact with Israel, and because  it had offered asylum to Iran's ousted shah.
