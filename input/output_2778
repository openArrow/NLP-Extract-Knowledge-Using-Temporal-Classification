The leader of Lebanon's Shiite community called on  the UN Security Council and civil rights groups late Saturday to secure the  release of the abducted pro-Iranian Moslem guerrilla chief Mustafa Dirani.
Sheikh Mohammed Mehdi Shamsaddin condemned Dirani's abduction as "an act  of piracy" which violated "Lebanon's sovereignty and was against international  law."
Dirani, 46,  was abducted by Israeli commandos in a daring pre-dawn raid  on his home in the village of Qsarnabaa in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley  in eastern Lebanon.
Israel holds him responsible for the capture of Israeli airman Ron Arad,  still missing after his plane was shot down over south Lebanon in 1986 during  an Israeli bombing raid of a Palestinian refugee camp.
Shamsaddin, president of the Supreme Islamic Council of Lebanon's Shiite  community, said the abduction "revealed Israel's true intentions as regards  Lebanon's independance," denouncing it as an "terrorist" act.
By late Saturday there had still been no official reaction by the Lebanese  authorities to the kidnapping, although the details were reported by the  official agency ANI which called it an "new act of Israeli piracy."
The spiritual guide of the fundamentalist pro-Iranians Sheikh Mohammad  Hussein Fadlallah criticised "Europe and America's silence in face of such  repeated aggressions on Lebanon by Israel."
Earlier Saturday the Iranian-backed Hezbollah said: "This crime shows  there is no safe place in Lebanon. The Zionist danger threatens us all."
Hussein Khalil, head of Hezbollah's political bureau, said: "The war  aaginst the Israeli enemy is long and will continue in various ways.
"The enemy after this operation has changed its tactics," he said "by  widening the geographical area of confrontation," in a move which the  resistance would match.
Israel is hoping Dirani will confirm reports that Arad is still alive and  being held by Iranian Revolutionary Guards, a charge which Tehran has strongly  denied.
