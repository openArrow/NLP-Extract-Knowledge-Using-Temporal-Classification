Emerson Fittipaldi wants Formula One  to adopt some Indy car safety measures so his friend Ayrton Senna will not  have died in vain.
In the wake of three tragic Formula One crashes, the reigning Indianapolis  500 champion from Brazil considers himself safer here at top speeds of 245 mph  (392 km/h) than on much slower Formula One courses.
"The Formula One (safety) rules are not as good as Indy car," Fittipaldi  said. "Our chassis is higher and gives much better protection to the driver's  head. In F1, the driver's shoulders are just sticking out. The helmet is the  only protection. There's not enough material on the side if you're hit there."
Fittipaldi, the 1972 and 1974 F1 world driving champion, also wants  stronger car bodies. He hopes future drivers might survive crashes similar to  those which killed Senna and Austria's Roland Ratzenberger and Thursday's  mishap that left Austria's Karl Wendlinger in a deep coma.
"In F1, they need to increase the minimum weight of the cars, which (at  1,350 pounds) is 250 pounds less than Indy cars. They really look fragile,"  Fittipaldi said. "That's the main problem in my opinion."
Wendlinger's crash brought concern from drivers practicing for Saturday's  pole qualifying for the May 29 Indy race. Contenders on the 2.5-mile (4km)  oval average more than 227 mph (363 km/h), but have greater aerodynamics for  better handling at top speed.
