JERUSALEM: Israel demanded a written promise from PLO leader Yasser Arafat  that he would respect their peace agreements after a second row broke out over  a speech he made. A furore erupted last week when a radio aired a broadcast of  Arafat calling for a "jihad" or holy war to recapture Jerusalem during an  address at Nelson Mandela's inauguration. Israel's demand followed a second  broadcast, in which Arafat said "an agreement can be made with the enemy and  then broken as soon as possible." Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who had  described Arafat's explanation of the jihad comment as "evasive," this time  wanted the PLO leader to reply in writing, the premier's spokeswoman Lynda  Shimon said.
