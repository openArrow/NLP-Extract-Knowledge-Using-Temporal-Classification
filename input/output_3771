The estimated number of leprosy cases worldwide  dropped to 2.4 million in 1994, 23 percent lower than the 3.1 million cases in  1993, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement issued in the  Philippine capital Wednesday.
"The dramatic progress achieved in the global fight against the disease  makes us more than ever optimistic that the target of eliminating leprosy as a  public health problem before the end of the century will be met," Shaik  Noordeen, chief of WHO's Leprosy Unit was quoted as saying.
The fall in cases was attributed to the continuing use of a multidrug  therapy (MDT) against leprosy which was introduced in 1981. The MDT was  developed when the disease became resistant to the traditional drug, Dapsone.
WHO also announced that the First International Conference on the  Elimination of Leprosy will be held in Hanoi from July 4 to 7.
The conference jointly sponsored by WHO and the Sasakawa Memorial Health  Foundation will bring together specialists and decision makers from 27 endemic  countries as well as representatives of donor countries and international  institutions such as the World Bank.
The conference will serve to review the global situation, identify  remaining problem areas and seek to strengthen the commitment of both endemic  countries and donors to meet the World Health Assembly year 2000 deadline for  the elimination of leprosy, the WHO added.
