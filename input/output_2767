A late strong bid for the Golden Palm  emerged Saturday with the premiere of the latest work from Quentin Tarantino,  director of the cult movie "Reservoir Dogs."
Demand for seats at a preview screening of "Pulp Fiction" was so strong  that many journalists were unable to get in -- the organizers had the  thankless task of trying to squeeze 3,500 hacks into 1,000 seats.
The two-and-a-half-hour movie, starring John Travolta, Bruce Willis and  Harvey Keitel, provoked immediately favourable reactions. "I think it is  definitely in the running," said one.
Parodying various genres, notably Bonnie and Clyde and gangster movies,  the film is based on a complex structure in three parts, with apparently  unrelated characters coming together in a final tour de force climax.
Despite the furore surrounding the film Tarantino, who attracted  widespread critical acclaim and a certain notoriety for his 1992 hit  "Reservoir Dogs," remains cautious about its prospects.
"All I can say is, I love what we've done and I can't waiit to watch the  film ... through the eyes of an audience," he said.
The premiere of "Pulp" came two days before the Golden Palm is awarded,  and as a small number of the 23 films entered in competition are beginning to  emerge as frontrunners.
"Three Colours Red," by Krzysztof Kieslowski, seems to have the most  consistent support, while "To Live" by Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou and Nanni  Moretti's "Dear Diary" are following close behind.
