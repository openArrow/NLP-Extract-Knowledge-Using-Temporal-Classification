English Premiership club Tottenham Hotspur will  face a Football Association Commission on June 14 to answer charges of  irregular payments to players.
If the commission finds Spurs guilty they could be relegated to the First  Division, although a heavy fine is more likely.
Tottenham submitted their written reply on Thursday to the charges,  relating to alleged offences before Alan Sugar gained control of the club.
The club's shares plummeted earlier when a rumour swept the City that they  had already been relegated by the FA.
