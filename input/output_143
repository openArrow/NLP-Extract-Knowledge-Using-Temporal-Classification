The Spanish central bank cut its main lending rate  a quarter point to 7.50 percent Friday.
The move, which follows a similar cut in the rate on April 22, had been  expected after the Bundesbank cut a half-point from its discount and Lombard  rates on Wednesday.
Analysts expected the Spanish bank to further cut the rate, already at its  lowest level since the 1970s, to 7.0 percent by the end of the year.
Thursday the bank announced that Spain's gross domestic product rose 0.5  percent during the first quarter of the year, ending 15 months of recession.
Economists said this year's growth was due largely to exports and that  domestic demand remained sluggish.
