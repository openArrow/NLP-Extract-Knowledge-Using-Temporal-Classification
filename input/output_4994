More than 100 tombs were desecrated in  this northern town by two youths overnight "just for fun," police said  Saturday.
On arrest the 14- and 15-year-old vandals told police they enjoyed the  noise of breaking commemorative plaques, vases and crosses they threw in the  air.
They were turned over to their families after questioning. The damage will  have to be paid for by their parents, police said.
The youths may be summoned before a youth tribunal at a later date, police  added.
