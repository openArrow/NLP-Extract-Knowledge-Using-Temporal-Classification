Sanyo Electric Co. Ltd. of Japan and Western Digital  Corp. of the United States said Tuesday that they would jointly develop an  integrated circuit chip to connect computers and compact disc drives.
Sanyo aims to manufacture samples of the chip by the end of the year.
The chip will be designed to work with the enhanced integrated device  electronics (IDE) interface which Western Digital introduced last year.
The enhanced IDE interface allows a computer to connect up to four  peripherals, including a compact disc/read only memory (CD-ROM) drive.
It also has a data transfer speed four times faster than the present IDE  interface.
The agreement also includes joint sales promotion of Sanyo's CD-ROM  decoder chip and Western Digital's IDE interface chip.
