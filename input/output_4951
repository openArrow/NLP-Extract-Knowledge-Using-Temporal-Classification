English Premiership clubs Everton and Norwich City  reached a settlement on Saturday over manager Mike Walker's move to Merseyside.
Everton have dropped their appeal against the 125,000 pound penalty  imposed on them by the Football Association for poaching Walker from Carrow  Road.
The two clubs issued a joint statement saying they were bringing the  long-running saga to a close.
Walker is now expected to drop his civil case for constructive dismissal  against the Canaries, although the Goodison boss is refusing to make any  comment on developments.
The joint statement read: "Everton FC and Norwich City have expressed a  wish to restore the harmonious relationship they enjoyed prior to this issue  and feel that the conclusion of the proceedings is in the best interests of  both clubs and football generally."
Everton, who narrowly escaped relegation to the First Division earlier  this month, were fined 75,000 pounds and ordered to pay Norwich 50,000 pounds  compensation.
