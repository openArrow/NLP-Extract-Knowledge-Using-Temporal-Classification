The 15-member Security Council voted  unanimously Wednesday to put an immediate end to the 17-year-old mandatory UN  arms embargo on South Africa.
The council also voted to dissolve a council security committee created in  1977 to handle the South African issue, which played a key role in the  anti-apartheid movement at the United Nations in the 1970's and 1980's.
