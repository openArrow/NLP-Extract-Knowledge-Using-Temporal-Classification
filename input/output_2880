A man was killed and another seriously injured when  suspected loyalist paramilitaries burst in on a pub fundraising gathering of  the Irish Republican Army's political wing Sinn Fein, police said Sunday.
At least three men tried to push past a doorman at the bar in Dublin city  centre where IRA sympathisers were holding a collection late Saturday for IRA  prisoners in Ulster. The attackers opened fire after the doorman refused them  entry, injuring the doorman and another man who came to his aid.
Both were taken to hospital where the doorman was pronounced dead shortly  afterwards. The other was said to be in a "serious but stable" condition.
The attackers left a small bomb at the pub, whose detonater exploded. The  main charge failed to go off, however, and was made safe by police.
Police said the attack bore the hallmarks of a loyalist paramilitary  action. They believed a Northern Ireland-registered car later found burnt out  in a northern Dublin suburb may have been used by the terrorists.
The previous major loyalist attack in Ireland was in May 1974, when 33  people were killed and a further 300 injured in two bomb attacks in Dublin and  Monaghan. No group claimed responibility for the attack at the time, but the  Ulster Volunteer Force recently said in a television broadcast it carried out  the bombings.
Dublin has seen little of the violence which has plagued the North since  the "Troubles" between republican and pro-British groups broke out in the late  1960s, but loyalist groups have signalled they will target the South if Dublin  shows any sign of playing a larger role in Ulster's affairs.
