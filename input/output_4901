Artur Jorge has yet to sign for Benfica, the  Portuguese champions' president Manuel Damasio said Saturday.
Jorge, who steered Paris St Germain to the French league title this  season, had been expected to take over from current coach Toni.
However, Damasio said Toni still had a role to play in the club's future,  although he would not go into details.
