President Boris Yeltsin abolished export quotas on  Monday, called for tax cuts and cracked down on inter-enterprise debt in a  major economic overhaul aimed at stopping a drastic fall in production, a  presidential aide said.
Alexander Lifshits, the head of a presidential panel of experts, told  reporters that the six decrees signed by Yeltsin on Monday would spur  free-market reforms which, he said, were slowed down by parliament's lack of  initiative.
Yeltsin ordered that export licences and quotas, except those applying to  certain "strategic materials" outlined in existing legislation, such as  uranium, be cancelled from June 1.
He also mandated government with the task of drafting bills cutting  business and value-added taxes by 10 percent to 20 percent and creating a  special tax regime for businesses which have attracted foreign investment.
Yeltsin authorised that state control be re-established over several  businesses considered to be part of "vital sectors" of the economy and also  stated that mismanaged enterprises would also be placed under government rule.
In a bid to curb capital flight out of Russia, Yeltsin decreed that  entreprises would have the right to one bank account only and warned that any  business violating that order more than once would be placed under state  control.
Finally, he established an agency with the task of issuing and managing  bonds to finance inter-enterprise debt and said that all businesses would be  forced to convert their hard currency earnings into rubles to cover their  debts.
The measures were announced after production output had fallen by 24.7  percent in the first quarter of 1994, triggering concerns of impending mass  unemployment and economic collapse.
Yeltsin also decided to establish a consolidated fund to finance road  repairs and construction in Russia.
