Gunmen opened fire on two minibus-taxis in  central Johannesburg on Saturday, killing six people and wounding another six,  police said.
Spokesman Wikus Weber said the attack was almost certainly connected with  an ongoing "taxi war."
He said the car-borne attackers opened up with automatic Kalashnikov  assault rifles, using tracer bullets which set the two vehicles on fire at a  taxi-station.
Four people died immediately in the dawn attack and two more on the way to  hospital, Captain Weber said.
Several people have been killed in recent years in the fight between rival  companies over the lucrative business of providing transport between their  jobs in the cities and their homes in nearby townships.
