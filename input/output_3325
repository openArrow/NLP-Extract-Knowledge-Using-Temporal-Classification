The Security Council on Monday began  examining a resolution that would lift the 17-year-old UN arms embargo on  South Africa, diplomats said.
Following South Africa's first all-race elections, the Security Council  also may dissolve a commission that monitored matters in the country while  apartheid policies still were in effect, diplomats said.
South Africa was formally accepted Monday as a member of the Organization  of African Unity.
