North Korea has resumed removal of fuel  rods at a nuclear site in defiance on international inspectors, which could  make a full accounting of weapons-grade fuel impossible, the International  Atomic Energy Agency said Friday.
In a letter to UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, IAEA director  general Hans Blix said the action could prevent inspectors from determining  whether nuclear fuel was being diverted for weapons.
"At the time of writing this report almost half of the fuel in the reactor  core has been discharged and in a pattern that has precluded the agency's  ability to implement the full range of the safeguard measures required," Blix  wrote.
The IAEA and North Korea were trying to agree conditions for checking the  removal of fuel rods from a reactor at Yongbyon.
The letter, a copy of which was obtained by AFP, said that if the  discharge continues at the same rate, the agency's ability to determine the  use of nuclear fuel "will be lost within days."
