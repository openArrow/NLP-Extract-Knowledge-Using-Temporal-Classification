Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has instructed his  ministers to show up for work at eight in the morning, warning that legitimate  illness is the only excuse for staying away from the job.
Saddam issued the directive as he chaired the first session of his new  cabinet on Monday, the Iraqi News Agency reported in a dispatch received here.
The president on Sunday sacked his prime minister, Ahmad al-Khodair, and  took over the job himself in what analysts said was a bid to impose tighter  control on the struggling national economy.
"This is the first measure that must be applied," Saddam decreed. "From  now on, every one of you should be at your ministry at eight in the morning.
"Only those who are sick will be authorized to contact the cabinet  secretary to inform him of the problem. That will enable us to know that  someone is sick, to inquire after his condition and to wish him a speedy  recovery.
"But all those who are not sick should be present at eight o'clock. I  don't want any other excuses.
"Those who pretend to have slept late have no excuse. Instead of going to  bed at two in the morning, they should retire at one. If they don't get to bed  before two, even though they have to get up at five or six, they will have to  learn to go to bed earlier."
Iraq has been reeling from the effects of a United Nations economic  embargo that was imposed following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
