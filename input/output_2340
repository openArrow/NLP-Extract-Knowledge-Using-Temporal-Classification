The Tokyo High Court awarded 11.5 million yen  (110,000 dollars) Friday in compensation to the parents of a 13-year-old boy  who committed suicide eight years ago, saying schoolyard bullying was the  cause.
The high court increased the amount of compensation from four million yen  that the Tokyo metropolitan government, Nakano ward office, and parents of two  classmates who allegedly bullied the boy, were ordered to pay in the earlier  ruling.
A Tokyo District Court ruling had said in March 1991 there was no "direct  link" between the suicide and the bullying. The parents of Hirofumi Shikagawa  appealed the decision, seeking 60 million yen in compensation.
However, presiding judge Nobuo Kikuchi said Friday that the boy was  continuouslly bullied at Nakano Fujimi junior high school in Tokyo's suburb of  Nakano for five months before he killed himself in February 1986.
"There is no doubt that bullying was the main cause of the suicide," the  judge said.
The school, run by the Nakano ward office, bears responsibility for the  boy's death because it did not prevent the bullying even though teachers knew  he had been bullied, the judge said.
Persecution among students is common in Japan's intensely competitive  schools, observers said. Victims are usually shy or handicapped pupils.
In a suicide note, Hirofumi Shikagawa wrote that the bullying was "hell on  earth." The school's authorities said the pair made him dance in class with  his face painted and often made him run errands for them.
