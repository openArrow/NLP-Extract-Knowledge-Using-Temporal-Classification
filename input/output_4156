Japan's Mitsubishi Electric Corp. said Thursday its  group pre-tax earnings fell 10 percent from a year earlier to 71.4 billion yen  (693 million dollars) in the year to March but forecast a rebound this year.
The country's third-largest manufacturer of electrical machinery said  consolidated sales fell five percent to 3,105 billion yen in the same period.
For the current year, however, Mitsubishi projected improved earnings of  74 billion yen with sales edging up to 3,110 billion yen.
"While foreseeing a good semiconductor market situation in the US, as well  as steady public investment and partly favourable signs in individual  consumption, it is forecast that the yen's appreciation will continue and  capital investment by the private sector and building-related demand will  remain inactive," the company said in a statement.
Mitsubishi said increased heavy machinery sales in the latest year were  offset by lower sales of consumer products, industrial and automation  equipment and information, telcommunications and electronic systems and parts.
"The management faced a severe environment in almost every area,"  Mitsubishi said, citing electric power, transportation and public-use related  fields as the major exceptions along with semiconductors, especially exports.
Overseas revenue dived nine percent to 648 billion yen as a result of the  stronger yen although sales abroad were higher in foreign currency terms.
Mitsubishi said sales of heavy machinery leapt six percent to 828 billion  yen. But sales of industrial products and automation equipment dropped eight  percent to 515 billion yen and sales of information, telecommunication and  electronic systems and devices sagged five percent to 994 billion yen.
Sales of consumer and other products plunged 12 percent to 925 billion  yen. Sales between segements reduced the total by 157 billion yen.
