A top official of Germany's far-right Republicans  said Tuesday she had resigned from the party because it had become too  extremist under the leadership of former Waffen SS officer Franz Schoenhuber.
Martina Rosenberger said she had resigned as national secretary because of  the party's "growing extreme rightwing ideas," saying that no change was  possible under Schoenhuber's leadership.
She held him responsible for what she called the Republicans' move from  being a conservative party to an extreme rightwing one, and said the grouping  was now "anti-democratic and no longer vote-worthy".
Rosenberger said Schoenhuber had divested all levels of the party of any  responsibility and that he alone took decisions.
Schoenhuber, a member of the European parliament, caused a political storm  in Germany in April for suggesting that the leader of the German Jewish  comunity was himself guilty of inciting racial hatred in the country.
The Republicans, who claim 23,000 members, are the strongest of Germany's  far-right or openly neo-Nazi parties. They also have elected members in the  Baden-Wuertemberg parliament and on local councils.
Federal Interior Minister Manfred Kanther has called on all the regional  state intelligence services to put the party under surveillance, but it has  not been officially classified as among the "extreme right."
However Bavaria's interior minister, Guether Beckstein, himself of the  very conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), said separately Tuesday: "It  is quite clear that the Republicans are on the road to rightwing extremism."
Beckstein said the Republicans showed "excessively anti-foreigner  attitudes" and made "nationalistic anti-semitic statements."
Bavaria's Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the regional  political security service, has for the first time begun reporting upon the  activities of the Republicans in that part of the country.
