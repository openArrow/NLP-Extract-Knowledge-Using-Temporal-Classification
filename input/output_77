Reduced costs and less stress are making  state officials consider more multiple executions after putting two prisoners  to death earlier in the week.
"The attorney general is talking to us now about the next multiple  execution," said Arkansas Department of Correction spokesman Alan Ables  Thursday.
Convicted murderers Jonas Whitmore and Edward Charles Pickens died by  lethal injection Wednesday within about an hour of each other in the same  chamber.
Ables said more than one execution on one day saves money spent on  preparations and overtime.
He also said prison workers face less stress with multiple executions.  "Nobody wants to get up in the morning and go kill somebody," said Ables.
Two or more executions on the same date "would lessen that anxiety that  the officers are faced with," said Jim Clark, president of the International  Association of Correctional Officers in Washington.
"It should save the taxpayers a considerable amount of money and we  certainly encourage multiple executions," said Dennis Martin, executive  director of the National Association of Chiefs of Police.
Arkansas called in 32 extra state police to the prison Wednesday night  along with over 45 other people not normally on duty.
Multiple executions were once common in the United States. Arkansas  executed two people on four separate dates in 1960. Until Wednesday, no  multiple executions had taken place in the United States since the Supreme  Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976.
Executions are are becoming more frequent with prisoners convicted since  1976 reaching the end of their appeals. Whitmore and Pickens brought the death  total to 239 since 1977. More than 2,800 people are sitting on Death Row in  the United States.
The next multiple execution in Arkansas could take place in July or  August, said Ables. The state has 41 inmates on Death Row.
