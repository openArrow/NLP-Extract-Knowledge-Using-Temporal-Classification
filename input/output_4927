Mairead Maguire, a Northern Ireland activist who  won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1976, was ordered expelled upon landing in the  Philippines Saturday to attend an outlawed conference on East Timor.
Maguire and fellow Irish activist Tom Hyland were detained by immigration  officials at the Manila International Airport, and were expected to be  deported as soon as possible.
They were the first foreigners to be expelled after the Philippines  cracked down on the conference, which was to have opened Tuesday, under severe  pressure from Indonesia.
Maguire (formerly Corrigan) and Betty Williams were joint winners of the  peace prize for founding the Northern Ireland Peace Movement.
