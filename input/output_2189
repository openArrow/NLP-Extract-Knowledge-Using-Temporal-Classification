President Bill Clinton spelled out Thursday  five reasons to justify why the United States could end up taking military  action against Haiti.
"We plainly have a significant interest in Haiti," said Clinton.
"First, it's in our back yard. Second, we've got a million Haitian  Americans. Third, we've got several thousand Americans in Haiti. Fourth, we  believe drugs are coming through Haiti to the United States. Fifth, we face  the possibility, the continuous possibility of a massive outflow of Haitian  migrants to the United States," Clinton said.
Clinton has said he would keep the military option open to restore the  democratically elected government of exiled president Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
However there is believed to be strong Pentagon opposition for military  action. Many lawmakers are also opposed.
A senor Republican lawmaker however has urged Clinton to consider another  military option -- taking the Ile de La Gonave, a small island off the Haitian  coast, to be used as a refugee processing center as well as a base for  Aristide, who was ousted in a 1990 coup.
"The island ... could be utilized to provide a base for the Aristide  government on Haitian soil and to provide a safe haven for refugees without  endangering US personnel," said Representative Newt Gingrich, the  second-ranking House Republican, in a letter to Clinton.
Gingrich said the proposal, initally made by Florida Representative Porter  Goss, would avoid a potentially costly invasion and avert logistical problems  of implementing Clinton's new policy guaranteeing an asylum hearing to all  Haitian refugees.
