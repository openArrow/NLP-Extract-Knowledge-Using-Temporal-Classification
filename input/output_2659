President Ali Abdallah Saleh on Saturday rejected  his rival Ali Salem al-Baid's announcement of an independent state in southern  Yemen.
The proclamation was "unlawful" and would never be accepted, said Saleh at  Moslem prayers to mark the feast of Al-Adha in a speech broadcast on Sanaa  Radio.
Seventeen days into a civil war between the south and the president's  northern forces, Baid, the ousted vice president, announced the creation of  the "Yemeni Democratic Republic as an independent state with its capital in  Aden."
Saleh said the north's announcement earlier of a three-day ceasefire for  Al-Adha which started on Saturday was still valid.
"But we will never accept this secessionist decision," he said. "We will  offer our sons, our brothers, friends and comrades in-arms as martyrs ... for  the sake of this nation and preserving Yemeni unity."
Despite the ceasefire from midnight Friday (2100 GMT), the south was  fighting on all fronts Saturday and its warplanes and ships bombarded northern  troops, a military spokesman charged in Sanaa.
