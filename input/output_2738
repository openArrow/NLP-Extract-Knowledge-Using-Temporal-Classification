French international winger Philippe  Saint-Andre scampered over in the left hand corner to grab a championship  final place as Montferrand beat big favourites Grenoble 22-15 here on Saturday.
His side will meet Toulouse, who beat Dax 30-25 in the second semi-final,  for the title at the Parc des Princes on Saturday, May 28.
Grenoble ran the game up front, with international lock pairing Olivier  Merle and Oliver Brouzet dominating the line-outs.
But Montferrand lived off scraps to steal the match with Saint-Andre's  crucial second-half score.
Dax, despite a late short-penalty try by former French skipper Olivier  Roumat, never coped with Toulouse's free-running style. Winger David Berty  scored two tries to set up the win.
