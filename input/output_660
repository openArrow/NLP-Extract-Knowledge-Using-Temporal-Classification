A British carrier was set to fly an empty airliner  into Orly airport here Sunday as the so-called "sky wars" landing rights row  between Britain and France hotted up for a showdown.
Air UK said it would land an empty Fokker plane at Paris's second biggest  airport around 10:10 p.m. (2010 GMT) ahead of a planned return to London with  passengers early Monday.
The 100-seat plane, which if it takes off will become the first  British-operated London-Orly flight, is scheduled to leave at 7:15 a.m.
Up to 10 British airliners from UK Air as well as British Airways (BA) and  its TAT subsidiary plan to fly from Orly Monday in breach of the French ban.
BA, TAT and Air UK are insisting with British government backing that they  are entitled to start flights to Orly Monday in line with a European  Commission ruling last month.
But French authorities have been barring British flights to the airport in  defiance of the decision that ordered France to open three domestic routes --  Orly-London, Orly-Toulouse and Orly-Marseilles -- to competition.
The flight Sunday was apparently not in defiance of the ban since there  were no passengers.
BA threatened Friday to sue the French government if it stopped the  company's flights, while French aviation authorities were reported ready to  reject the British carriers' flight plans, which under aviation rules would  make it illegal for them to take off from London.
French Transport Minister Bernard Bosson, who has been in constant contact  with his British counterpart John MacGregor in a bid to defuse the row,  refused Saturday to give details of the state of negotiations between the two  sides. A MacGregor spokesman would only confirm that the talks were continuing.
Bosson earlier described the affair as a "storm in a teacup" and predicted  that "everything will be back in order" by Monday.
