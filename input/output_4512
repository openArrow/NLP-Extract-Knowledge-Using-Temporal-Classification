An ally of President Fidel Ramos obtained a  Philippine court order Friday barring the holding in Manila of a controversial  conference on alleged human rights violations in East Timor.
Copies of the temporary restraining order, obtained here, said Renato  Constatino one of the leftist organizers of the conference, put a 20-day hold  on the event, due to start in a suburban state university May 31.
The court found "sufficient in form and substance" a petition from the  Philippines-Indonesia Friendship Society which charged that the meeting would  violate a treaty binding Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  members to respect each other's territorial integrity.
The Philippines and Indonesia, along with Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and  Thailand are members of ASEAN.
The privately organised conference has strained relations between Manila  and Jakarta which annexed the former Portuguese territory in 1976. Jakarta has  cancelled several business missions to the Philippines in an apparent attempt  to persuade Manila to call off the conference.
Jose Laurel, head of the friendship society, said in a statement released  by the presidential palace that while the organizers might invoke freedom of  speech, the government had the right to "protect itself against unlawful  conduct and against incitements to commit unlawful acts."
Laurel is a member of the Laurel political clan which has since allied  itself with Ramos.
Conference organizers said they were studying the order to see what action  they could take.
