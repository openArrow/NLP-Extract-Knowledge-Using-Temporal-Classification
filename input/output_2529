Olsen, whose side effectively knocked England out of the World Cup and  ended the international career of previous manager Graham Taylor, will be  without several key players in Sunday's friendly because of injuries and the  demands of home clubs where the season is still going on.
It will be the first meeting between the two teams since Norway's 2-0  triumph in the Oslo World Cup qualifier last June.
Those missing for Norway include striker Oyvind Leonhardsen, midfielder  Eric Mykland and full-back Stig Bjornebye.
Olsen's comments will do nothing to improve the reception for his team  from what could now be an 80,000 full house at Wembley.
After Tuesday's match, which attracted only a 23,659 crow, demand for  tickets has rocketed.
The Norwegians have entered the national psyche for what they did to  Graham Taylor's men, and although Venables does not want to get drawn into old  vendettas, he realises how much victory on Sunday would mean to the fans who  suffered then.
"It's a recent sore and it's still inflamed, " he said, adding: "There's  nothing personal as far as I'm concerned. I will just take great delight in  winning as many games as I can.
"But after this, it's going to be a long time before we come together  again, and that is motivation enough to win."
Venables hopes to have learned from Taylor's experience.
He said of the Oslo defeat: "I would be silly not to have picked up  something from that game. I watched half of it only late last night and there  were definitely three or four things."
