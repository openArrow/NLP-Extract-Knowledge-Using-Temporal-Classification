Malaysia denied Thursday that it was planning  to defy a UN embargo and supply weapons to the Moslem-led Bosnian government.
"We are not in the gun-running business," the Bernama news agency quoted  Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad as saying in response to a Cable News Network  (CNN) report that Kuala Lumpur planned to arm Bosnia's Moslems.
CNN reported that Malaysia, Iran and Turkey were considering supplying  weapons to Bosnian Moslems as part of efforts to defend them separatist Serbs.
But Mahathir said Malaysia had so far only provided arms to its 1,500  troops serving with UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, and had no intention of  extending the facility to Bosnian soldiers.
"If somebody is providing arms to Bosnia, we know nothing about this," the  premier said.
Mahathir, a bitter critic of the west for its failure to end the  atrocities in Bosnia, has repeatedly called on the United Nations to lift the  arms embargo against Sarajevo.
