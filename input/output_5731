Jonathan Bell, pushing for his first  test cap against Australia in Sunday's Brisbane international, plays for  Ireland against an Australian XV here on Wednesday night.
The 20-year-old Ballymena centre played impressively for the Irish in last  Sunday's much-improved 29-26 loss to Queensland in Brisbane.
Ireland have rested their first-string players who pushed Queensland to  the wire except for uncapped Cork second rower Gabriel Fulcher and Bell.
The Irish will be looking for only their second win in five tour games  here, after heavy losses to New South Wales and the Australian Capital  Territory and a last minute loss to Super Ten champions Queensland.
Australian XV: Andrew Apps, Alistair Murdoch, Joe Roff, Paul Cornish, Ryan  Constable, Tyron Mandrusiak, Mark Catchpole, Dan Crowley, Tim Dalton, George  Websdale, Justin Nowlan, Rob Korst, Willie Ofahengaue, Brett Robinson, Fili  Finau
Replacements: Craig McMullen, Pat Howard, Steve Merrick, Marco Caputo,  Owen Finegan, Richard Harry
