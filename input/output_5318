Grand Prix motor racing breathed a  collective sigh of relief at the end of Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix.
There had been no serious accidents, the newly-revised cars had stood the  test and the result could not have been better for the sport.
The victory of Britain's Damon Hill in the Williams-Renault was welcomed  as the right outcome for the team and for Formula One.
It broke the run of victories by Michael Schumacher to boost interest in  the World Championship.
And it was what the stricken Williams team needed to restore their morale  after the death of Ayrton Senna.
Hill, indeed, dedicated the victory both to the team, which had endured "a  terrible month", and to Senna's fans in Brazil.
But the drive of the day was certainly that of Schumacher, whose gearbox  locked into fifth gear half way through the race. He coped brilliantly with  the problem, adapting his driving style and his line through the corners to  maintain his second place with remarkable lap times.
The only recent precedent was set by Senna himself when he won his home  race in Brazil with only sixth gear useable in the final laps.
On the "political" front, the Formula One family, as McLaren boss Ron  Dennis expressed it, had finally come together to form a united front to the  outside world.
After the public rows of the weekend over rules, there was general  agreement among the team managers to draw a veil over the arguments and look  ahead.
Their engineers were to meet in London on Tuesday to decide on further  changes to the cars that would both increase safety and be practical in cost  and time.
