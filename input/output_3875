Fast bowler Andrew Caddick has been ruled out of  contention for England's First Test against New Zealand, the country of his  birth.
Caddick failed a fitness test on a shoulder problem on Wednesday. He  missed out on selection for the two one-day internationals, the second of  which was rained off at the weekend, but had hoped to be fit for the  Nottingham Test series opener starting next Thursday.
Caddick, born in Christchurch of English parents, qualified for England in  1992 and was his adopted country's leading wicket-taker on the recent tour of  the West Indies.
