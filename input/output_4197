Russia is not setting any conditions for its  membership in NATO's "Partnership for Peace" (PFP) programme, but will still  await the alliance's response to its proposals for cooperation before signing  up, Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said Thursday.
He presented a set of propositions to the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance  Wednesday on cooperation, notably on creating a mechanism for consultation on  security in Europe and throughout the world, and on increased military and  political cooperation.
A well-placed NATO source said Wednesday that the Russian minister  proposed levels of participation proportional to Moscow's military weight,  indicating an enthusiasm exceeding all expectations.
"We thought (Russia) was only prepared to dabble its toe in the PFP, but  Grachev indicated it was ready to dive in," the NATO source said.
But Grachev also called for a formal system of consultations between  Moscow and NATO on European and world security.
He reiterated Russia's wish for regular and automatic meetings with NATO  at all political and military levels.
The Atlantic alliance is resisting any formal commitment to such  consultations.
"NATO is not ready or willing to give any droit de regard (right of  influence) or even worse a veto over its activities," NATO deputy secretary  general Sergio Balanzino told a press conference Wednesday.
Balanzino, the chairman of Wednesday's meeting, suggested that NATO was  willing to accept the evolution of a "constructive and substantial dialogue"  if Russia embraced the military partnership.
But NATO rejected a treaty formalising bilateral relations with Russia,  although it did not rule out a less formal declaration when Moscow signs the  PFP.
