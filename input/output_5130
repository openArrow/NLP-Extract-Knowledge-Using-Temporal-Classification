UN disarmament chief Rolf Ekeus said Sunday he had  made headway in talks here with Iraqi officials on applying UN resolutions to  destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
"We have made certain progess. But we have to preserve it to maintain the  momentum," Ekeus told AFP after meeting Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammad Said  Sahhaf late Saturday, who was on a stopover en route for Cairo.
The head of the UN special commission for Iraqi disarmament (UNSCOM) is to  present a report to the UN Security Council on Tuesday on setting up a  long-term monitoring of Iraqi military capability due to start in July, a  reliable source said.
Ekeus was due to resume talks late Sunday with an Iraqi delegation  including General Amer Rashid head of the Iraqi military industries.
He expressed his "satisfaction" over the initial talks with Iraqi  officials, saying they aimed at "clarifying certain issues in order to make  progress."
"We are fairly satisfied, although we have not concluded our talks yet,"  he said noting that any eventual lifting of the Iraqi sanctions would be  decided by the Security Council.
A UN embargo was imposed on Iraq when it invaded Kuwait in August 1990,  before Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's army was driven out again by a US-lead  coalition in February 1991.
But the embargo has remained in force backed by UN resolutions requiring  Iraq to destroy its weapons of mass destruction and set up a long-term  monitoring system.
Ekeus said the aim was to get the embargo lifted, adding that "we are  trying to establish whether (Iraq) has respected the UN resolutions."
Iraq has argued on several occasions that it has complied fully with the  resolutions.
He is in Amman for a meeting of the UN Economic and Social Commission for  Western Asia, which opened Sunday.
