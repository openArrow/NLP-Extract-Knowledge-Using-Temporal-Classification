Nobel literature laureate Alexander  Solzhenitsyn arrived back in his native Russia early Friday after 20 years in  exile, a correspondent said.
The author of "The Gulag Archipegalo" and "A Day In The Life Of Ivan  Denisovich" flew into this far eastern Russian city from Anchorage, Alaska, on  a stopover on his way to Vladivostock.
Solzhenitsyn, who has lived the life of a recluse in Vermont, was welcomed  home by Magadan's mayor Nikolai Kartenko, flanked by girls bearing flowers and  traditional bread and salt.
