Denmark declined Wednesday to send troops to  join a UN peace force in Rwanda, saying African countries ought to be backing  the initiative.
Foreign Minister Niels Petersen said he was sceptical about the plan to  deploy 5,500 soldiers to protect civilians and aid agency staff in the  bloodied central African state. The basis for the mission was "a bit unclear"  and one big question mark was whether the UN troops would have "reasonable"  means to carry out their task, the minister said.
Petersen said parliament's foreign policy committee had given full  backing to the decision to stay out of the Rwandan force. It should be  regional powers as part of the Organisation of African Unity which took part,  Petersen said.
He noted that Denmark was already making a large contribution to UN  forces elsewhere and had no spare manpower.
Denmark has 1,500 troops in service with UN forces, 1,300 of them in the  former Yugoslavia.
