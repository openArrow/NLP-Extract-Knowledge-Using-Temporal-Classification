Formula One driver Karl Wendlinger remains  stable after his crash on Thursday, with doctors now encouraged by the  Austrian's condition here Saturday.
Wendlinger crashed during a practice session for Sunday's Monaco Grand  Prix and is currently in a deep coma, with swelling around the brain.
Professor Dominique Grimaud, head of the intensive car unit at Nice's  Saint-Roch university hospital, said Wendlinger's condition was "still stable.
"There has been no aggravation of the clinical indicators, but an oedema  of medium density remains."
Grimaud, sounded a note of optimism though when he described the  Austrian's state of health as being "an encouraging stability -- but nothing  more."
Another doctor, speaking on grounds of anonymity, said: "He has come  through the first 48 hours after the accident -- during which the chances of  neurological deterioration are at their highest."
Wendlinger's family and fiancee, along with members of his Sauber-Mercedes  team, have been taking turns to stay at the driver's bedside.
The Austrian crashed two weeks after Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger  were killed in accidents at the San Marino Grand Prix.
