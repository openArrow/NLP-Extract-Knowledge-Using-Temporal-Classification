Government troops and rebels fought throughout the  night with heavy weapons around a gendarmerie base in Kigali and the camp of  the presidential guard, but the guns fell silent just before 9:00 a.m. (0700  GMT) Monday, UN spokesman Abdul Kabia reported from the Rwandan capital.
That was shortly after a ceasefire had been due to come into effect at  8:00 a.m.
