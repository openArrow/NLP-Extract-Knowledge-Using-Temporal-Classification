The French industrial and nuclear Framatome group  last year made net profits of 863 million francs (151 million dollars), down  9.15 percent on 1992 profits, the group said in a press release Tuesday.
The drop was due to fewer orders for its military and aeronautical  production and to the cost of restructuring the Jeumont firm, bought from  Schneider in March 1993.
Over the year, turnover was up 33.85 percent at 17 billion francs (2.98  billion dollars), compared to 12.7 billion francs in 1992.
The nuclear industry remained the group's main area of activity,  representing 60.9 percent of its turnover at 10.4 billion francs, compared to  eight billion in 1992.
Industrial equipment, which in 1992 represented 12 percent of sales,  gained market share, notably in the field of telecommunications, oil and gas.
Exports continued to grow from 4.8 billion francs in 1992 to 6.5 billion  in 1993.
Framatome also said that results for the first quarter of this year and  the state of its order books were good.
