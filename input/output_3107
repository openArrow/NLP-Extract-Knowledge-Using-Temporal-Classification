China wants an early solution to financing  problems that have entangled plans to build a new airport for Hong Kong, a  senior Chinese official said Monday, calling on Britain to take Chinese  proposals "seriously."
Zhang Junsheng, vice-director of Xinhua News Agency, China's de-facto  government representative in Hong Kong, said China did not want to prolong  negotiations on the financing of the mammoth airport scheme, but "the  difficulty is not on the Chinese side."
The British side must "seriously consider" the Chinese proposals in order  to reach an agreement based on the Sino-British airport memorandum in 1991,  Zhang told reporters.
He was speaking after attending the opening of a four-day forum, the Hong  Kong '94 China Trade and Investment Conference, jointly hosted by the Chinese  ministry of foreign economic relations and trade and the Hong Kong Trade  Development Council.
Zhang's remarks came after Britain and China failed on Friday to agree on  financing for the 20.3-billion-US-dollar Chek Lap Kok airport and related  works.
Site preparation for the new airport is well under way, but Britain and  China have long been at loggerheads over the amount of debt that should be  raised to pay for the undertaking, considered to be the world's largest public  projects.
