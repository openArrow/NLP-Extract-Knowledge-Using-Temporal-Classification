Palestinian police arrested and beat  four armed Palestinian collaborators in the autonomous area of Jericho,  Palestinian sources said Monday.
However the four men carrying Uzi guns were released without any serious  injury after a couple of hours when they showed Israeli passports.
According to the sources they came from the occupied West Bank town of  Nablus and were looking for one of their comrades who had disappeared.
Jericho security chief Jibril Rajoub refused to comment and police  spokesman Mohammad Shaker was not immediately available.
On the Gaza Strip, police chief Nassr Yussef issued a stern warning to  Islamic fundamentalists after HAMAS executed two suspected collaborators on  Friday.
HAMAS announced it would stop killing collaborators, but only temporarily  to see if the police could do its job.
The Gaza police arrested two armed fundamentalists last week, but released  one of them.
Almost 1,000 Palestinians have been murdered by fellow Palestinians since  the intifada erupted in December 1987, but Israel maintains that fewer than 40  percent were collaborators.
