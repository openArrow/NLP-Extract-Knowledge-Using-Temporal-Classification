Rival Iraqi Kurdish factions met in Silopi,  southeast Turkey, on Monday in a Turkish-backed initiative to end fighting in  northern Iraq, the semi-official agency Anatolia reported.
Representatives from the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the  Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) who have been battling since the beginning  of May took part in the meeting with Turkish officials.
But neither KDP leader Massud Barzani nor PUK head Jalal Talabani attended  the meeting in Silopi, near the Iraqi border.
Fighting has continued in northern Iraq despite ceasefire agreements and  split the region into PUK and KDP-controlled zones.
Tehran Radio said Monday that thousands of Kurds had fled their homes in  northeast Iraq amid intensified fighting between the two factions which has  left at least 100 dead.
The radio reported stepped-up clashes in Arbil, Qala Diza, Sulaymaniyeh  and the Haj-Omran region of Halabja, near the Iranian border.
Northern Iraq has been under Kurdish control since it was established with  the help of the US-led coalition which drove Iraqi occupying forces out of  Kuwait in February 1991.
The Silopi meeting also discussed plans to hold fresh elections in Iraqi  Kurdistan, Anatolia said.
