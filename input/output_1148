Premier Li Peng has joined senior Chinese leaders  in stressing the absolute necessity of ensuring social stability as  authorities brace themselves for the fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square  massacre.
In a speech carried on the front page of all major Chinese newspapers  Tuesday, Li cited paramount leader Deng Xiaoping as saying that "without a  stable social and political environment, it will be impossible to carry out  reforms or construction."
The publication of the speech coincided with the detention in Beijing of  Wang Dan, a prominent student leader during the 1989 pro-democracy movement.  Wang was picked up at his house by 10 police officers while being interviewed  by foreign journalists.
Li's remarks also echoed the ominous warning delivered by President Jiang  Zemin last week, when he defended the bloody June 4 suppression of the 1989  movement and stressed that national stability would be maintained at any cost.
"In the early period of establishing a socialist market economic  structure, it is of strategic importance to maintain social stability," Li  said in his speech to a national conference of civil affairs officials.
This was an invaluable experience which China had acquired during the past  10 years, Li said.
Since the beginning of the year, Chinese leaders have repeatedly  emphasised the paramount importance of national stability and their warnings  have been backed up by widespread arrests of dissidents and a law and order  crackdown that has seeen a sharp rise in the number of executions.
