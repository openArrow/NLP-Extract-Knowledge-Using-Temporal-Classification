A mild earthquake rocked this port  city and the capital Dhaka on Sunday, sending thousands of panic-stricken  people into the streets, but there were no reports of casualties.
The temblor struck at around 8:16 p.m. (1416 GMT) and lasted for about two  minutes, the residents said.
The metereological department in Dhaka said the capital was shaken for a  "fraction of a second."
Police said they had received no reports of casualties or damage, but some  residents remained outside their homes, fearing aftershocks.
An earthquake in January in northern Bangladesh killed four people.
