An explosion rocked a chemical plant here  Friday, killing one person and forcing 1,700 nearby residents to flee their  homes.
Flames shot hundreds of meters (yards) into the sky and a dark cloud  billowed above the site before firefighters were able to bring the blaze under  control.
The dead person was one of three employees who were in the Shell Chemical  Co. plant. The other two are missing and presumed dead, the company said in a  statement.
Fifty to 75 of the plant's 480 employees were working when the explosion  erupted.
The fire broke out around 6:30 a.m. (1130 GMT) in one building and spread  to at least one tank holding an unidentified substance. The plant produces a  thermoplastic rubber used in automotive parts, footwear and adhesives.
Residents were allowed to return to their homes late Friday afternoon.
