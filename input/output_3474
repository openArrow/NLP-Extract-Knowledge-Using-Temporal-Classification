Northern forces have made a "breakthrough"  in the oil-rich Shabwa region but will never reach the production fields,  south Yemeni leader Ali Salem al-Baid said here.
Baid, speaking late Monday in this eastern port where he has set up base,  said that oil production was continuing in the Massila field at more than  150,000 barrels a day.
"There is a breakthrough from Maareb (east of the capital Sanaa) towards  Shabwa, but they will never reach the oil fields they are after," he said.
Baid, who has declared an independent state in south Yemen ending the four  year union with the north, said that negotiations were underway with the  Canadian oil company Canoxy on revenues, which were usually paid to the  government in Sanaa.
