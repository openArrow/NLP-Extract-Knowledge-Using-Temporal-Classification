Jailed former Venezuelan president Carlos Andres  Perez was kicked out of the Democratic Action (AD) party that had twice made  him leader of the nation.
Eighty percent of the social democratic party's leaders ratified late  Thursday the executive board's expulsion order, said AD Secretary General Luis  Alfaro Ucero.
Former Caracas mayor, Claudio Fermin, protested the expulsion and  announced that he would consult more than one million party members around the  country to see if they accepted their leaders' unilateral decision.
Perez, 71, was jailed May 18 pending trial on charges that he and two of  his former cabinet members misappropriated 17.2 million dollars in government  funds.
Perez, who served twice as president from 1974-1979 and 1989-1993, faces a  maximum 10-year prison sentence if convicted.
