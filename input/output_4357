Derbyshire battled through a traumatic opening day  in their English county championship match against Nottinghamshire, which  included losing two players before the start of play.
In the only other match to escape the rain, Lancashire's England A batsman  John Crawley hit an unbeaten 119 against Somerset in front of full England  captain Mike Atherton.
Derbyshire lost Indian batsman Mohammad Azharuddin, struck down by a  virus, and pace bowler Allan Warner, who was hit on the head during fielding  practice, before they faced their East Midlands rivals at Ilkeston.
Tim O'Gorman was recalled from a reserve match at Blackpool and helped  rescue his county from disaster.
Warner suffered no serious damage, but the Derbyshire batting was soon in  a critical condition on a sluggish pitch which offered some slow turn.
West Indian Jimmy Adams claimed two victims with his left-arm spin and  then Andy Pick ripped out the middle order in a lively second spell after  lunch.
Derbyshire were in deep trouble at 114 for six, but O'Gorman, with an  unbeaten 40, and Karl Krikken, hitting 27 before being trapped lbw to Gregory  Mike, helped them to 211 for seven at the close.
Crawley helped steer Lancashire to a commanding 288 for four at Southport,  after sharing in a stand of 167 with Nick Speak.
Atherton himself was out early, caught at second slip off seamer Graham  Rose for 17.
Crawley linked up with Jason Gallian to put on 79 for the second wicket,  the Australian-born Gallian going past 50 for the fourth time in seven  innings.
Pakistan leg-spinner Mushtaq hit back for Somerset, removing Gallian and  Graham Lloyd as Lancashire slipped to 113 for three.
But Crawley and Speak put them back on top. Speak made 87 before slicing  Mushtaq to Andy Hayhurst at point.
