China welcomed Friday US President Bill Clinton's  decision to renew its most favored nation trade status this year and abandon  his policy of linking trade to human rights.
A foreign ministry spokesman said the decision would create favourable  conditions for further strengthening and expanding of bilateral trade and  economic cooperation and help to improve relations between China and the  United States.
The spokesman, quoted by the Xinhua news agency, also called for the early  lifting of all existing US sanctions against China.
