Japan's first woman astronaut, Chiaki Mukai, 42,  will blast off on July 8, in a 13-day mission aboard the US space shuttle  Columbia, the Mainichi daily reported Friday.
The shuttle, which will also have six Americans on board, will carry out  80 experiments in near-zero gravity conditions, under a programme vetted by  the space activities commission of the prime minister's office, it said.
Japan's first man in space was a journalist, Toyohiro Akiyama, who flew  aboard the Soviet Union's Soyuz craft in December 1990.
The Columbia mission takes off from the Kennedy space centre in Florida.
