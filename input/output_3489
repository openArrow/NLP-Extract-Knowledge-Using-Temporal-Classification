England, smarting from two defeats, have  beefed up their mid-week side with some big guns for their match on Wednesday  with modest provincial side Western Transvaal.
Captain Will Carling, Tony Underwood, Nigel Redman and Ben Clarke are the  test regulars brought into the side in an attempt to ensure a first tour  victory.
"We've got to get on with the job, and victory will ease a little bit of  the frustration," said Carling, whose side has gone down to both Orange Free  State and Natal.
England manager Jack Rowell said his team was under strength for the first  two games and he was not going to make the same mistake against Western  Transvaal when the two sides meet in Potchefstroom, 150 kilometres (90 miles)  west of Johannesburg.
England have been struggling to find form and with less than two weeks  before the first test, Carling admits his men are "desperate" for a win.
