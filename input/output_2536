higher. The price of white sugar ended the week above 330 dollars  per tonne, on expectations India will import around 500,000 tonnes in the near  future.
Sugar's rise was magnified by speculative buying. Dealers said there were  rumours that India could buy between six and 10 deliveries of sugar.
The latest report from Czarnikow confirmed that India -- the world's  largest consumer and producer of sugar -- was severely lacking in sugar. It  said the harvest had diminished from 11.52 million tonnes in 1992-1993 to an  expected 10.32 million tonnes for this season.
After a fall in Indian production, Czarnikow revised downwards its world  production estimates by 1.5 million tonnes to 110.13 million tonnes for the  current sugar year. Last year, production was at 111.55 million tonnes.
