Aston Villa striker Dalian Atkinson  has been told he can leave the club by his namesake, manager Ron Atkinson.
News of Atkinson's availability comes just three days after he failed to  travel to South Africa with the rest of the Villa squad for an end of season  tour.
The English League Cup winners will be looking for around two million  pounds for Atkinson, 26, who cost 1.6 million pounds from Spanish club Real  Sociedad almost three years ago.
Villa chairman Doug Ellis has told his manager any new signings must be  financed by the sale of existing players.
The striker, who blamed domestic problems for not catching his flight,  confirmed: "The manager has told me that I can leave if a club comes in for  me."
He is now due to fly out to join his teammates on Monday.
