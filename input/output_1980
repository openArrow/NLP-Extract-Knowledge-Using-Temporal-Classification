The Supreme Court of Israel threw out Thursday a  petition from two lawyers demanding the sacking of an Arab judge from the  Hebron massacre inquiry committee.
The Tel Aviv advocates alleged that Ahmad Zoabi had shown "prejudice" to  Jewish settlers in an interview with the Maariv newspaper and was not fit to  sit on the inquiry into the February 25 slaughter of 30 Moslems by a settler.
Zoabi, a Nazareth district court judge, denied the quotation attributed to  him that "settlers were the cruel party in the occupied territories".
The court noted his denial and said even if he had uttered those words  they were not even to have him removed.
However the ruling added that it was preferable for judges or members of  such committees not to give newspaper interviews.
The committee, which closed a first round of hearings at the end of April,  was expected to begin fresh sessions in the coming weeks, concentrating on  witnesses who may bear some responsibility in the Hebron events.
