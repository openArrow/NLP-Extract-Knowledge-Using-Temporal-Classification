Last-man James Brinkley was a final-ball hero for Worcestershire as they  survived desperately bad light at New Road to deny Gloucestershire (203 for  seven) victory.
The home side, in contention to reach the formidable target of 265 in 54  overs until two Courtney Walsh breakthroughs just after tea, had only two  wickets in hand with 13 overs remaining.
But Stuart Lampitt's undefeated 25 in the gloom held off the West Country  side until Neil Radford was caught off Martyn Ball at silly mid-off for 14 --  leaving Brinkley to survive the game's final delivery.
Worcestshire finished on 180 for nine.
