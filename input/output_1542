China said Wednesday the country's most celebrated  dissident Wei Jingsheng was still under investigation, denying reports that a  formal decision had been reached to bring him to trial.
A public security ministry spokesman made it clear that investigations  into alleged "fresh crimes" committed by Wei had yet to be concluded.
"Wei Jingsheng violated Chinese law while he was released on parole and  his political rights were withdrawn, and the police are in the process of  investigating his case," the spokesman said.
Foreign press reports quoting the ministry as saying Wei's case had been  handed over to the Chinese courts were "completely false," he said.
Wei, 44, was picked up by police April 1 as he tried to return to Beijing  from a forced exile in nearby Tianjin. The authorities then announced that he  was being investigated for unspecified new crimes.
Wei was released on parole in September last year, having served all but  six months of a 15-year sentence for counter-revoltionary activities.
The Chinese authorities were incensed when Wei met here in February with  US Assistant Secretary of State for Humanitarian Affairs John Shattuck and  called on Washington to take a hard line with Beijing over human rights.
