President Bill Clinton was negotiating with  Congressmen Thursday the final details of what sanctions if any he would  attach to his renewal of China's trade privileges, but there was still no word  on when he would announce a decision.
"I can't totally rule out that it will happen today. But as of right now,  there is nothing scheduled for today," White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers  said.
"There has been a lot of congressional consultation on this. There are a  few decisions that he has yet to make."
Myers had said Wednesday that debate was centered on the extent of  sanctions Clinton would impose in renewing China's most favored nation trading  status.
The various parties are discussing a ban on imports of some weapons and  ammunition made by the Chinese military. Washington might also establish a US  commission to monitor China's progress on human rights.
Clinton had said last year that he would not renew MFN beyond June 1994  unless China made significant progress on human rights.
He has since been caught between a human rights lobby and some Congressmen  who argue that China has signally failed to meet this condition, and the  business lobby which argues that disruption of a 40 billion dollar trade  relationship would be an economic catastrophe.
"He will keep MFN generally, but eliminate it for a few products," an  informed Congressional source said.
"We've been told it would be a complex and elaborate decision."
Those members of Congress who believe that trade is the administration's  most powerful weapon in pressuring China on human rights have accepted that  Clinton will renew MFN, but are pushing hard for significant sanctions.
