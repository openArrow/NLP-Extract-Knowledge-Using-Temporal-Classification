A 49-year-old Sydney man was charged Tuesday with  Australia's seven backpacker murders.
Roadworker Ivan Robert Milat also faced one charge of attempted murder and  six firearms and weapons charges.
Prosecutor Ian Lloyd told the court that several items similar to those  belonging to the backbackers had been found at the address of Milat and two of  his brothers.
Milat made no plea to the charges, but his counsel, John Marsden, said he  strongly denied the serious allegations against him.
The remains of seven backpackers -- three Germans, two Britons and two  Australians -- were found buried in shallow graves in the Belangalo State  Forest, near Bowral, between 1992 and 1993.
