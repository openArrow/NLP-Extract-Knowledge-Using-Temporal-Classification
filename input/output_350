The Hawks were top seeded in the East playoffs but struggled before  eliminating Miami in the first round. Atlanta has concentrated on shutting  down Smits inside and Miller, among the most accurate NBA shooters from  3-point range and the free throw line.
"Miller is a key," Atlanta's Jon Koncak said. "You have to contain him but  you can't foul him and can't let him shoot 3-pointers. Smits is the X-factor."
Indiana's Byron Scott, a veteran who played on NBA title teams for the Los  Angeles Lakers, said the Pacers were beaten before they started game two.
"We didn't act like a team that had won 12 in a row," he said. "Half the  battle was coming out and playing physical. We lost before we ever got  started. They reminded us we can be beaten and they aren't Orlando."
Indiana guard Haywoode Workman expects a more aggressive Indiana team this  weekend.
"We need to come out and attack the basket, attack them on defense," he  said. "We've got to play like wild people out there. The challenge is there.  Everybody will step up and do what they have to. The streak is over, but the  series isn't."
