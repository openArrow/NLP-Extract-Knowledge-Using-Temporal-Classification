Unions were poised Tuesday to launch a series of  strikes to cripple Madrid's public transport system over the next  two-and-a-half weeks.
Launched over a salary dispute, the rolling strikes on the subway, city  and intercity bus and suburban train networks start Wednesday and are  scheduled to continue until June 10.
Transport unions have called 24-hour stoppages -- or four hours in the  case of trains -- every working day on two of the four networks.
They were preceded Monday and Tuesday by intercity bus stoppages which led  to the cancellation of half of rush-hour and 40 percent of other services.
Madrid commuters will face a transport nightmare Thursday when, unless a  wage accord is reached in the interim, both metro and city bus services are  due to be hit.
Both networks aim to run a minimum 60 percent service at peak times and 40  percent during the rest of the day.
On Tuesday subway managers proposed a 3.6-percent wage increase -- double  their previous offer. Unions are due to reply to the offer Wednesday. So far  they have been seeking a 4.5 percent increase.
Railroad unions, meanwhile, have called for stoppages Wednesday between  6:30 a.m. and 8:30 a.m and 6:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m., with identical four-hour  strikes to take place eight times up until June 10.
Minimum train services have been set at between 50 and 70 percent.
