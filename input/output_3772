The World Health Organization (WHO) Wednesday  called for a total ban on tobacco advertising in East Asia and the South  Pacific, blaming it for the rapid rise in smoking among women in the region.
"I believe that a ban on any kind of promotion, as part of the  comprehensive WHO tobacco control strategy, will lead to a sustained reduction  in smoking over time," WHO Western Pacific director Han Sang Tae said in a  statement.
He said increasing tobacco use in the region would lead to a sharp rise in  tobacco-related diseases, disabilities and deaths, with a shift toward the  developing world. WHO said annual tobacco-related deaths worldwide stood at  about three million.
He said the tobacco industry had succeeded in expanding its market through  aggressive promotional campaigning, which it was now directing at young  people, women and Asia in general.
Ads that targeted Western Pacific women, of which only five percent  smoked, were a "true attempt to create a market where none exists," he said,  adding that evidence was already emerging of an increase in smoking among  young girls in many countries in this region.
The Western Pacific includes China, the world's biggest tobacco producer  and consumer, the rest of East Asia, parts of Southeast Asia, Australia, New  Zealand and the South Pacific islands.
Han, restating a previous WHO prediction, said at least two million  Chinese would die from tobacco-related diseases by 2025.
