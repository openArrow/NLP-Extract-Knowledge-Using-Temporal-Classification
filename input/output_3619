A condom made of ice and contained in a block of ice  will be auctioned off to benefit the fight against AIDS, organizers said  Tuesday.
The association ARCAT-AIDS said major French companies would be invited to  the auction and asked to pay a 100,000-franc (18,000-dollar) admission fee  which will also go to the AIDS charity.
The auction is scheduled for June 27 to July 1.
The condom is to be fashioned by an ice sculptor.
