Argentina star Diego Maradona offered a prayer  at the Wailing Wall here on Monday -- but refused to reveal if he had called  on divine help to win the World Cup.
Maradona donned a Jewish skullcap to leave a little written note at the  holiest site in Judaism.
He earlier shook hands with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and gave him the  team's pennant ahead of Tuesday night's World Cup warm-up against Israel in  Tel Aviv.
