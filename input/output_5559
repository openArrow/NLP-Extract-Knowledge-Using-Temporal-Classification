Representative Dan Rostenkowski said Monday he  would fight charges he misused public funds rather than accept a plea bargain  that would end the career of one of Congress' most influential members.
"I am confident that I will be vindicated and I look forward to the return  of the gavel," said Rostenkowski, 66, who heads the lower chamber's powerful  Ways and Means Committee.
Prosecutors had given the Illinois Democrat until Tuesday to decide  whether to accept a plea bargain that would force him to resign but let him  off with a short prison term, or face several felony counts and a lengthy  trial.
Sources said Rostenkowski is to be indicted on charges he defrauded  taxpayers of hundreds of thousands of dollars by hiring ghost employees,  trading House of Representatives post office stamps for cash and making  improper purchases from his official account.
Rostenkowski has denied any wrongdoing but he has reimbursed the Treasury  about 82,000 dollars for gift and furniture purchases.
"Truth is on my side," said Rostenkowski, who vowed to "fight to regain my  reputation."
He acknowledged that it would be a difficult fight, however, pointing out  that "the government has vast resources at its disposal."
His Democratic colleagues are also concerned that the scandal could taint  their party ahead of the legislative elections in November but few in  Washington are surprised the beefy, tough-talking "Rosty" would accept a plea  bargain.
His committee holds the government purse strings and his influence with  legislators, lobbyists and presidents has become legendary.
President Bill Clinton, who is counting on Rostenkowski to push his  crucial health care reform bill through the legislature, campaigned for him  during a March primary in Illinois.
Rostenkowski's Chicago district has reelected him by overwhelming margins  every two years.
Sources said the grand jury's indictment could come down as soon as  Tuesday.
