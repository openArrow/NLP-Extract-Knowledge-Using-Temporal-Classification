The Irish consul in San  Francisco, Declan Kelly, is to be prosecuted for drunken driving and causing a  traffic accident, in which five people were hurt, prosecutor Arlo Smith said  Saturday.
Kelly went through a red light and hit several vehicles in the accident,  which happened here on May 5. He refused to undergo a test for alcohol,  invoking his diplomatic immunity.
A blood sample taken in hospital after the accident for medical reasons  showed that his blood had more than twice the level of alcohol than the legal  limit.
