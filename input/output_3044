Brazil's Marco Greco completed the  fastest field in Indianapolis 500 history here Sunday, bumping Canada's Scott  Goodyear to reach the 33-car field.
Greco became the fourth Brazilian in the starting lineup and the ninth  driver whose first Indy start will come next Sunday. The field averages a  record qualifying speed of 223.270 mph (357.232 km/h).
He joins front-row countrymen Emerson Fittipaldi and Raul Boesel and  fellow rookie Mauricio Gugelmin.
Greco was the only qualifier here during the final day of time trials,  knocking out Goodyear with a four-lap qualifying average of 221.216 mph  (353.945 km/h).
"I was confident," Greco said. "I knew I could do it. But it was really  tough to watch the other drivers."
Australia's Geoff Brabham joined US drivers Gary Bettenhausen and Willy  Ribbs with aborted attempts too slow to make the race. Mark Smith crashed  during his attempt but was unharmed.
Their failures left rookie Bryan Herta the slowest qualifier, who waited  nervously until Ribbs failed on the final attempt.
"I never wish anything bad on anyone, but I wash hoping he wouldn't run  more than 200 mph," Herta said.
Brabham's bid came closest but the hottest weather of the month hindered  every team's quest for speed. His first lap was fast enough, but followed by  two other slow ones that ended his bid for an 11th Indy start.
"Conditions were not good, but we had to try," Brabham said. "I knew it  was going to be close. It felt OK on the first lap but started to push on the  second and got steadily worse. It's really disappointing."
