Saudi Arabia has assured the Philippines of crude  oil supply even in times of crisis by virtue of a 40 percent stake in the  country's largest oil refiner, Petron Corp., the energy department said here  Sunday.
A department statement quoted Energy Secretary Delfin Lazaro as saying  that Saudi Arabia will also explore ways to expand bilateral economic  cooperation in areas outside the oil sector.
Lazaro made the remarks after accompanying Saudi Arabian Minister for  Petroleum and Mineral Resources Hisham Nazer to a meeting with President Fidel  Ramos on Sunday, the statement said.
Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco), the kingdom's state-owned oil  firm, late last year offered 502 million dollars to win the bid for 40 percent  of Petron and became the Philippines' "strategic partner" in the company.
Manila has retained 40 percent of Petron and plans to sell the remaining  20 percent through the stock market.
Lazaro said Saudi Aramco, which has one of the world's most efficient oil  refining operations, hopes to discuss technology transfer arrangements with  the Philippine government.
Some legislators have said that alleged irregularities in the bidding  process had tended to favor Saudi Aramco and that Petron was sold at a bargain  -- charges denied by energy officials.
