Bosnian Serbs shelled Tuzla airport in northern  Bosnia-Hercegovina Tuesday shortly after the first UN plane landed on the  northern airstrip since its reopening in March, an UNPROFOR military source  said.
The plane was unable to complete unloading and took off immediately, the  source said. No casualties were immediately reported.
