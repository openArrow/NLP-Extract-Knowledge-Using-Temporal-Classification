Belgium's football team, one of the few factors of  unity in an increasingly fragmented country, will start the World Cup as one  of the top six seeds but the Red Devils very nearly ended up in the audience.
Paul Van Himst, who took over in 1991 from Guy Thys, the chain-smoking  veteran who guided Belgium to the previous three finals, had a dream start to  his first World Cup campaign.
Six matches. Six wins. Twelve goals scored. Just one conceded.
But a 2-0 defeat by Wales in Cardiff signalled the start of a collapse and  the team, masterminded by the hugely talented Enzo Scifo, came within minutes  of throwing it all away.
Reduced to ten men, Van Himst's men only just held on for the 0-0 draw  they needed in their final qualifier against the Czech and Slovak republics.
Van Himst, a former international player who is now a wealthy director of  a coffee roasting firm and looks after the national team on a part-time basis,  will be looking for a more composed performance when Belgium kick off in group  F against Morocco.
The draw has been kind to the Belgians, grouping them with two of the  weakest teams in the tournament -- Morocco and Saudi Arabia -- and neighbours  Holland.
It would be a major upset if they failed to advance to the second round  although Van Himst acknowledges that playing Morocco and Holland in the humid  heat of Orlando could pose problems for his side.
To prepare for the conditions the Belgian squad is to spent ten days at  the end of May at altitude in the French Pyrenees. They then have friendlies  lined up against Zambia on June 4 and Hungary on June 8.
Belgium's status as top seeds is largely based on their run to the  semi-finals in  Mexico in 1986 but they also impressed in Italy, where only  Germany matched their first round performances, and they were unlucky to lose  to a last-minute goal to England in the second. The core of that team will  form the backbone of Van Himst's United States selection.
