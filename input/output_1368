The United Nations has warned the two  main rival Kurdish leaders in northern Iraq that any more fighting between  their supporters could jeopardise international aid, a UN official told AFP  Tuesday.
UN area security coordinator Stafford Clarry delivered the warning Monday  to Massud Barzani and Jalal Talabani, who lead respectively the Kurdistan  Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.
One hundred people at least were killed in heavy fighting between the KDP  and the PUK that erupted early this month and ended a week ago.
Barzani and Talabani "should realise that the international community has  not chosen to remain in Iraqi Kurdistan .. so they can engage in armed conflit  among themselves," read Clarry's warning.
The message, a copy of which was given to AFP, stressed that the UN  presence aims at providing the Kurds with "protection against an external  threat", in a reference to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's government.
The KDP and the PUK have controlled a major part of northern Iraq since an  uprising following the February 1991 defeat of Iraq in the Gulf war.
The US and its allies imposed an air-exclusion zone over northern Iraq to  keep out Iraq warplanes and protect the Kurds.
Clarry, an American, said the latest clashes will seriously affect the  goodwill of donor countries who financially support the Kurds.
He also said the clashes have stopped or seriously disrupted the UN aid  programs, including water supplies to villages, food distribution and medical  services.
Most of the Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) operating in Kurdistan  had to stop their activies during the fighting, although they were pressing  ahead with existing programs.
The clashes however "may make it difficult to initate new programs," said  Save the Children field director Bronwen Lewis, a Briton.
The fighting, which the PUK said was triggered by a personal dispute, has  already had a negative impact on the German NGOs, whose coordination and  support office in Shaqlawa town was ransacked and its Kurdish guards arrested.
The head of the office, Eberhard Walde, said he was recalled back to  Germany.
