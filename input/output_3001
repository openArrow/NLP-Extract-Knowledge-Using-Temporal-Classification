The United Democratic Front of newly-installed  President Bakili Muzuli failed to secure a majority in parliament, according  to the official results of Malawi's first multi-party poll released Sunday.
The results, published the day after Muzuli's inauguration ended three  decades of iron rule by outgoing head of state Hastings Kamuzu Banda, gave his  UDF 84 seats in the 177-member legislature, the electoral commission said,  five short of an overall majority.
Banda's Malawi Congress Party secured 55 seats and the Alliance for  Democracy 36 seats.
Five other formations -- the Malawi Democratic Union, Malawi National  Democratic Party, Congress for Second Republic and United Front for  Multi-Party Democracy -- failed to win a seat.
In the presidential poll, Muluzi won 1.4 million votes, 47.16 percent, to  996,353 or 33.45 percent for Banda.
