Italy considers its exclusion from a group of  countries coordinating action on Bosnia "unacceptable," Italian Foreign  Minister Antonio Martino said Tuesday.
"Italy plays a primary role (in Bosnia) as it provides bases to the NATO  allies," the new foreign minister told reporters in Washington after meeting  Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
Martino told an Italian newspaper earlier, "Italy must take part in the  decision-making process" concerning Bosnia, where it has "important  geographical and military interests."
The so-called contact group on Bosnia includes the United States, Russia,  Germany, Britain and France. Delegates met Tuesday in Geneva and were to  continue discussions Wednesday in Talloires, France.
Martino also told Christopher that Italy hoped to obtain a permanent seat  on the UN Security Council with Britain, France, China, Russia and the United  States.
"A Security Council without Italy would not be recognized by Italy,"  Martino said.
Earlier, Christopher expressed "great confidence" in the new Italian  government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
Asked to comment on the coalition government including the neo-Fascist  National Alliance, Christopher underlined the "great friendship between our  two nations" and added, "we have a lot of business to do together."
The government includes Berlusconi's Forza Italy, the federalist Northern  League and the neo-fascist National Alliance, the three parties which banded  together to win the March 27-28 general elections.
Martino said at the start of discussions that Rome's foreign policy "will  be based on continuity ... Italy will continue to be a loyal and reliable  partner."
The foreign minister also met with representatives of the US Jewish  community to underline Rome's interest in the Middle East peace process.
He was due to meet later Tuesday with president Bill Clinton and national  security adviser Anthony Lake.
