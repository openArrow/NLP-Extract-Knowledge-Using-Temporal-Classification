Japanese car maker Mitsubishi has entered a joint  venture with Vietnamese and Malaysian partners to assemble automobiles in  Vietnam, local press reports said Thursday.
The joint venture set up as the Vina Star Motors Corp., received  government approval Monday and includes Mitsubishi, Vietnamese company  Vietranscimex and Malaysian car maker Proton.
The group will establish a 50 million dollar assembly plant in south  Vietnam's Song Be Province which is to have 50 percent of its capital supplied  by Mitsubishi, and 25 percent each from Vietranscimex and Proton.
The group plans to begin assembling vehicles in March 1995, after the  first phase of construction on the factory is complete. The company did not  state its initial production capacity.
Three vehicle assembly plants already operate in Vietnam with foreign  partners.
