Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi won Senate approval  by a single vote Wednesday for a rightist government that includes  neo-fascists, effectively confirming him as leader of Italy's 53rd post-war  government.
The vote sets the stage for Berlusconi to get down to work as premier  because his coalition has an absolute majority in the Chamber of Deputies, so  the scheduled confidence vote there is seen a formality.
Senate speaker Carlo Scognamiglio said that of 314 senators casting votes  in the 326-seat chamber, 159 were in favor, 153 against and two abstained. An  absolute majority of those voting was 158.
Controversy leading up to the vote had centered on the presence of five  neo-fascists in Berlusconi's 25-member cabinet, with centrists calling on him  to dump them in exchange for their support in the confidence vote.
Berlusconi leads a rightwing coalition that swept to victory in elections  in late March that confirmed the demise of corruption-tainted traditional  parties like the Christian Democrats and Socialists.
The coalition allies of his Forza Italia party are the neo-fascist  National Alliance and the federalist Northern League.
Earlier in the day Berlusconi, a media magnate-turned politician, rejected  calls from conservative and centrist senators to get rid of the neo-fascists.
If Berlusconi had failed to muster the needed votes, his government would  have collapsed, forcing President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to ask him either to  form a new cabinet or call new elections that could plunge the country into  crisis.
