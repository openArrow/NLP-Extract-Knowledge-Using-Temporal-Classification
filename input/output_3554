A distraught Sabatini admitted that her loss to Mary Joe Fernandez 6-2,  6-7 (4/7), 8-10 on the same court in last year's quarter-final after leading  5-1 in the second set, had left a mark on her.
"It took me a long time to get over that. I should have won it. But today  was different. She played really well. I don't think this defeat was so bad."
"But there is nothing wrong with the court. In fact I like playing on it."
"I had some good matches before the tournament. I'm doing everything right  but since I lost to Fernandez I have not won any big matches.
"I haven't beaten any of the top players and it's beating them that gives  you confidence."
