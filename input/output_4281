The UN World Food Programme (WFP) has started an  airlift of high-protein biscuits from Italy for Rwandan refugees encamped in  northern Tanzania, WFP announced in a statement released here on Thursday.
The statement said a US-funded DC-8 aircraft carrying 30 tonnes of  high-protein biscuits, donated to WFP by Australia, left the Italian city of  Pisa on Wednesday for Entebbe in Uganda, from where the consignment will be  trucked to Ngara and Murongo refugee camps in northern Tanzania.
A second flight with 30 tonnes of the high-protein biscuits was scheduled  to leave Pisa for Entebbe on Thursday, the statement said.
The high-protein biscuits are urgently needed to supplement maize, beans,  corn-soya blend and oil being supplied by WFP to the most vulnerable groups,  particularly the new wave of children arriving in the camps in poor  nutritional condition, the statement added.
Over 3O0,000 Rwandans have fled into northern Tanzania since the ethnic  violence between the Hutu majority and Tutsi minority erupted in Rwanda after  the death of President Juvenal Habyarimana in a plane crash on April 6.
Rwandan authorities alleged that the Tutsi-dominated rebel Rwandan  Patriotic Front (RPF) downed the plane with a rocket as it was approaching  Kigali airport, triggering a Hutu-Tutsi bloodbath that has led to the massacre  of up to 500,000 people.
