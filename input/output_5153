The girl they were calling the 'new Steffi Graf' at  the French Open earlier this week crashed to a humiliating straight-sets  defeat when she came up against the real thing here on Sunday.
The defending champion and world number-one gave 20-year-old Irina Spirlea  a 40-minute no-nonsense tennis lesson on the new 'A' showcourt at the Roland  Garros Stadium.
Graf surged into the quarter-finals after a 6-0, 6-1 victory against the  20-year-old 41st-ranked Romanian which reset the alarm bells ringing in rival  camps.
Spirlea eliminated last year's finalist Mary Joe Fernandez in the previous  round and after her defeat the American had said the East European reminded  her of Graf.
Alas the Bucharest hopeful never got her big-hitting game going and seven  double-faults hardly helped her case.
It was just the result Graf wanted to end her first week at the  Championships after a series of spectacular victories by twelfth-seeded Mary  Pierce had taken the spotlight.
Graf is expected to play the 6ft Candian-born French player in next week's  semi-final.
First, however, she will have to see off another of the emerging newcomers  by taking on either Ines Gorrochategui of Argentina or 16-year-old Iva Majoli  of Croatia.
Pierce earlier kept up her relentless march towards the title by hammering  the 18th-ranked Amanda Coetzer of South Africa 6-1, 6-1.
The 19-year-old, who has been under American coach Nick Bollettieri since  late last year, has so far dropped only four games in as many matches since  the Championships began last Monday.
Only five of the original 16 women's seeds have reached the quarter-finals.
Apart from Graf and Pierce, the others are Arantxa Sanchez, Conchita  Martinez and Sabine Hack.
