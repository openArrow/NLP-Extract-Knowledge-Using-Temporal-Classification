An Australian-led consortium has obtained promising  results at its offshore drilling site in the central Philippines which could  become the country's second oil-producing area, sources said Wednesday.
The group led by Ampolex (AOE) Ltd. encountered a 20-meter (66-feet) gas  column on the Villaba prospect off Leyte island after drilling a sidetrack  well on its first well, which had encountered mechanical problems, said  consortium sources. They asked not to be named.
Geologists say gas columns usually indicated the presence of hydrocarbons.
The sources said further tests were needed to determine whether the gas  column indicated oil in commercial quantities.
The energy department and the consortium leader would only confirm that  results of the Villaba-1A well were being evaluated.
The only oil discoveries in the Philippines are situated around the  western island of Palawan, and only one area is under commercial production.
Ampolex, Bridge Oil Petroleum, Crusader (Philippines) Pty. Ltd., and three  other firms, including a subsidiary of Vaalco Energy Inc. of the United  States, have sunk six million dollars into the Villaba project, which started  on May 1.
Preliminary tests made by the consortium indicated the presence of at  least 100 million barrels oil in place at the prospect, which covers 1.6  million hectares (3.95 million acres), Ampolex officials said.
Consortium sources said it was likely to drill a second well early next  year. The drilling season ends this month with the onset of the southwest  monsoons.
