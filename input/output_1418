New Zealand strolled to victory here on  Tuesday in their final tour match before their first one-day cricket  international.
The tourists, who face England in Birmingham on Thursday, were set a  modest 170-run target by Leicestershire in the 55 overs match, and romped home  by seven wickets with 21 overs to spare.
Afterwards New Zealand's delighted cricket manager Geoff Howarth said he  was looking forward to ramming odds for the one-day internationals, which have  England 11-4 'on' favourites for victory, down the bookmakers' throats.
Howarth said: "The last two games against Northants and Leicestershire  have been good performances.
"We have bowled tightly, fielded well and batted extremely well.
Fourth-wicket pair, Adam Parore and Stephen Fleming, shared a stand of 67  here in nine overs, hitting 57 runs off 35 balls after tea.
Left-handed Fleming made an unbeaten 35 off 27 balls with two sixes off  Adrian Pierson, plus four fours.
The foundations were laid with an opening partnership of 71 in 17 overs  between Blair Hartland and Bryan Young.
It was broken when young left-arm spinner Matthew Brimson had Young  smartly taken at slip by West Indian Phil Simmons for 36.
Pierson bowled Hartland and when Brimson had the Kiwis captain Ken  Rutherford out for eight to make it 103 for three, there was a glimpse of a  breakthrough for the county side. But Parore and Fleming slammed the door shut.
Leicestershire were bowled out for 169 in 53.3 overs after being put in,   with left-arm spinner Matthew Hart bowling impressively to finish with three  for 27 in 11 overs.
Paceman Danny Morrison confirmed his fitness with nine lively overs, which  brought him two for 23 and Dion Nash, his new-ball partner, also picked up two  wickets.
