Petric, who Golac stresses is still adjusting to the Scottish game,  warned: "I was not happy to lose.
"It was something I couldn't handle and I don't want to have to experience  it again."
At 500,000 pounds, Petric arrived for a fraction of the four million that  Rangers paid United for the potentially brilliant but temperamental striker  Duncan Ferguson.
Ferguson announced on Thursday that he would be appealing against his  12-match suspension for an alleged head-butt on Raith Rovers full-back John  McStay, an incident over which he faces a criminal charge.
The appeal means that he will be available for Hampden, but manager Walter  Smith may yet decide to leave him out for peace of mind.
Further trouble in such a high-profile game would surely seriously  jeopardise Ferguson's future in the Scottish game.
While United's lacklustre season has been punctuated by bursts of  brilliance in the cup, Rangers glorious treble pursuit has been tempered by  anti-climax, stumbling to the title with only two wins in their last nine  league matches.
Former England midfielder Trevor Steven, though, points to the seniority  of many of the Gers' player as a key motivating factor.
Steven, 30, said: "There is still an appetite to win among the players,  who can obviously see an end to their career, and they want to savour every  minute.
"They have enjoyed the life and want it to continue, so they're focused on  the fact that they will not be there two or three years down the line."
Whatever the outcome on Saturday, many supporters fear the spectacle will  be the poorer for a ban on players adorning themselves with fans' hats and  scarves during the after-match formalities.
It is understood that SFA officials fear a repeat of last year when  players, albeit unwittingly, wore scarves carrying offensive sectarian slogans.
