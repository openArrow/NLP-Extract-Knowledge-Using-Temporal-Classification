Japan's Takeda Chemical Industrial Co. Ltd. said  Wednesday its pre-tax earnings slipped 0.4 percent to 77.2 billion yen (750  million dollars) in the year to March and forecast a further decline this year.
The country's biggest drugmaker said sales fell 0.6 percent from a year  earlier to 562 billion yen. Increased revenue from pharmaceuticals,  agrochemicals and veterinary drugs was offset by lower revenue from  healthcare, food and vitamins, and chemicals.
Takeda projected a smaller profit of 72 billion yen for the current year  despite an improved sales forecast of 585 billion.
"The business environment in the pharmaceutical industry has entered an  extremely severe phase, as shown by the revision of drug pricing standards in  April and government policies to restrain medical expenses," the company said.
In the year just ended, drug sales grew 0.9 percent to 324 billion yen,  sales of agrochemicals and veterinary drugs climbed 8.7 percent to 47 billion  yen and sales of environmental products rose 6.7 percent to nine billion yen.
But sales of healthcare products dropped 4.5 percent to 51 billion yen,  sales of food and vitamins declined 5.9 percent to 62 billion yen and chemical  sales fell 5.9 percent to 68 billion yen. Exports were down 0.5 percent at 59  billion yen, the company said.
