Masters champion Jose-Maria Olazabal  packed five birdies into the last eight holes for a dramatic 65 and a one-shot  victory in the PGA Championship here on Monday.
He pipped South African Ernie Els, who had led since the opening day, and  who could only manage a final round 69.
The Spaniard, who goes to the top of the European Tour, said: "I won it  with my heart.
"I struggled off the tee, but I gave it 100 per cent and, to score 65 on  the final day of one of our most important tournaments, makes it one of best  rounds of my career."
The victory was worth 133,330 pounds, which takes the 28-year-old's  earnings this season to a staggering 615,000.
Olazabal, completing the same Transatlantic double which Nick Faldo  achieved in 1989 and Bernhard Langer last year, finished on the 17 under par  total of 271.
The victor said: "I knew Ernie was going to score well. He is young, but  very cool and I was right yesterday when I said that a 67 might not be good  enough for me."
Els, at 24 probably the best young player in the world, said: "I am very  disappointed, but I lost to the Masters champion scoring a 65."
Langer put up a sound defence of his title, finishing 14 under par, the  score by which he won by six last year, and which he had said he would settle  for again.
Els, three ahead at the start of the final day, twice fought off an  Olazabal assault, but could not do it a third time.
The San Sebastian player levelled by sinking a 15-foot eagle putt on the  fourth and a 12-footer for birdie on the next.
But Els, playing behind, birdied the fifth as well to edge back in front  and was two clear when Olazabal bogeyed the seventh.
