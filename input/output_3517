The cost of deploying French troops on missions  outside France in 1994 will come to 3.3 billion francs (589 million dollars),  French Defence Minister Francois Leotard said in an interview published  Tuesday in the financial daily Les Echos.
Leotard added that the figure was only provisional and he hoped the prime  minister would make a special budget provision as had been done for 1993.
In 1993, pay and expenses for deploying French troops abroad came to 4.4  billion francs, with an extra 1.7 billion francs expenditure on equipment,  making the total outlay 6.1 billion.
France is currently involved in around 20 missions outside the country,  involving a contingent of around 10,000 servicemen from the army, air force,  navy and gendarmerie.
In a separate statement, Leotard slammed the North Atlantic Treaty  Organisation for being top-heavy in its planning and chains of command for  peacekeeping operations.
Addressing a seminar on the Atlantic Alliance and European security,  Leotard said NATO's integrated military structure had "not been at all useful"  in the conflict in former Yugoslavia.
He said it was unthinkable for France to rejoin the alliance's integrated  military structure, which it left in 1966, and that the alliance should  undertake "more ambitious reforms."
