President Fidel Ramos said Friday that foreign  participants of a planned human rights conference on East Timor, opening in  Manila later this month, would be banned from entering the Philippines.
Their presence at the privately organized May 31-June 3 meeting would be  "inimical to the national interest," a presidental palace statement said.
The regional conference had sparked a diplomatic row between Manila and  Jakarta, with the latter threatening retaliation if it takes place.
Ramos cited the planned participation of Jose Ramos-Horta, a special  representative of the East Timor resistance.
He ordered Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon to "take immediate steps to  exclude such persons and other non-Filipino conferees."
On Thursday, Indonesia, angry at the East Timor seminar, had threatened to  scrap a meeting it had organised between Manila and group of Filipino Moslem  rebels.
The meeting is due to take place next month.
