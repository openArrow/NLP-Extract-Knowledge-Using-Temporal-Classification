Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has put a stop to  eating and drinking during cabinet meetings in a bid to bring some decorum to  the proceedings, a senior official said Wednesday.
Rabin had seen enough of the cabinet table covered in food and drinks  plastered across the world's television screens and newspapers and decided to  close what had become known as "Yitzhak's cafe".
The official, who sits in on the meetings, said ministers were "stunned"  on Tuesday when they arrived to see the table bare.
No more sandwiches, salads, fruit, cakes or hot and cold drinks.
In future those feeling the pangs of hunger will have to leave the cabinet  room for a small buffet in a nearby corridor.
Rabin has also banned ministers from talking to the press after the  meetings.
"The rush of ministers to get in front of a microphone or television  camera does no good to the image of the government," the official said.
However Rabin, who is also health minister and a chain smoker, has still  refused to sign into law a bill passed by parliament banning smoking in all  public places.
