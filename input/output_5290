Eighty-four percent of Japanese public rate the  ruling Hata administration as unstable and do not believe it will last, a  newspaper poll said Monday.
The poll by the daily Yomiuri Shimbun found that 61 percent of the  respondents did not believe Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata had a grip on his  government, Japan's first minority administration in 39 years.
The survey on May 21 and 22 showed that almost half of the 2,000  respondents considered Hata was not a capable leader.
Over 60 percent, however, felt Hata had an international diplomatic flair.
In the latest poll, some 52 percent of the respondents said Japan's Social  Democratic Party's pull out from the ruling coalition was fatal. The SDP, the  second largest opposition party, walked out last month following infighting.
