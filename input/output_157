The Principality authorities said on Friday that Prince Rainier had no  plans yet to cancel Sunday's race.
"There is no question of that at the moment," a spokesman said, adding  that such a decision would come from the Automobile Club de Monaco and race  organisers.
The comment follows speculation that if Wendlinger died, the prince would  have the race cancelled.
Officials here were meanwhile awaiting the outcome of a drivers' meeting  which started earlier in the morning.
