Israel threatened Monday to break off  negotiations unless PLO leader Yasser Arafat retracted remarks implying the  autonomy agreement was a ploy and could be broken.
Environment Minister Yossi Sarid said "Israel will not continue the  autonomy negotiations unless Arafat retracts his comments."
Israel radio on Sunday broadcast extracts from a speech made by Arafat in  South Africa in which he said the autonomy agreement was purely a tactical  move and could be broken.
Sarid said the remarks had created a "serious crisis of confidence"  between Israel and the PLO, which signed the Palestinian self-rule deal in  Cairo on May 4.
Israel was demanding that Arafat "totally denies these statements," Sarid  said.
Arafat spoke in English, but used the Arabic name for the pact, "solh  al-hodaibiya", which has entered Islamic history as a tactical ceasefire.
"It's an Islamic legal precedent regarding any agreement between the  Islamic world and infidels. An agreement can be made with the enemy and then  broken as soon as possible," he said.
The radio triggered a furore last week when it broadcast another extract  of the May 10 speech in which Arafat called for a "jihad" to recapture  Jerusalem.
Arafat had to hastily explain that despite the connotations of "jihad," he  had not meant a holy war by jihad.
