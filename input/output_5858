In the other half of the draw, Conchita Martinez will play fellow Spaniard  Arantxa Sanchez for the other finalist berth.
Martinez at last laid to rest a five-year jinx.
After failing to get any further than the quarter-finals on five previous  visits, the 22-year-old finally went one step further when she came back to  defeat Germany's sixteenth-seed Sabine Hack 2-6, 6-0, 6-2.
Martinez, who has won ten of her 18 career titles on clay and who had not  dropped a set and conceded only 21 games in the tournament, admitted  afterwards that the 'here we go again' alarm bells began ringing in her head  after she lost the first set, but she was able to turn them off.
Sanchez, who with Martinez is the only player in the world to have beaten  Graf in the last twelve months, had to slap back a late revival by plucky  24th-ranked French opponent Julie Halard.
Sanchez, winner of the title in 1989 and a finalist two years later,  finally clinched a 6-1, 7-6 (8/6) victory in a one-and-a-half hour clash.
At one stage Sanchez led 6-1, 5-3 before Halard, cheered on by a delighted  crowd basking in fierce sunshine surged back to force the tie-break.
Sampras, 22, a quarter-finalist here for the last two years, had  confidently been expecting to reach the semi-finals for the first time. He had  beaten Courier ten times in twelve encounters, two of the victories coming  this year, and he had finally appeared to have mastered the gruelling surface  by dropping only one set since the Championships began.
