The insurance market Lloyd's of London on Tuesday  announced losses of 2.048 billion pounds (3.072 billion dollars) for 1991,  compared with record losses of 2.3 billion pounds the previous year.
Analysts had predicted losses of around 2.5 billion pounds for 1991.
Lloyd's announces its results three years in arrears to take account of  claims. The 1991 results bring the total losses since 1988 to seven billion  pounds.
"For most insurers worldwide, 1991 was a difficult year and Lloyd's  results, although better than 1990, still show a serious loss," said Lloyd's  chairman David Rowland.
"Trading in 1991 contained the beginnings of an improvement in rating  conditions and underwriting practices which, by 1993, had led the market to  trade at a substantial profit."
The 1990 losses, initially reported at 2.9 billion pounds, were revised  downwards by 0.6 billion after some losses were counted twice, a Lloyd's  spokesman said.
This is the first time Lloyd's has deducted "double counting" losses -- in  1991, the market would have registered additional losses of 533 million pounds  were it not for this proceedure.
Net premium income was 6.014 billion pounds in 1991 compared with 5.3  billion in 1990.
The results were affected by "an unusually high incidence of 29  catastrophes" (a catastrophe is recorded if the insurance damage exceeds 100  million dollars) in the marine, non-marine and aviation sectors.
The two most serious were typhoon Mireille in Japan and the fires in  Oakland, California with insured losses of respectively around five billion  dollars and 1.2 billion dollars for Lloyd's and other insurers.
The 1991 results included a pure year loss of 615 million pounds compared  with losses of 937.4 million in 1990 -- a reduction of 34 percent. This  improvement is mainly due to an increase in insurance premiums in all sectors.
Pure year results are the underwriting results for the year of account  specified without accounting for deterioration on any prior years closed into  it. The total results for the year include any such deterioration.
Of the 349 syndicates writing in 1991, 111 made a profit of 205 million  pounds after personal expenses.
The 1991 losses are an additional rude shock to the 26,539 investors -- or  "names" -- who were members of the 306-year-old insurance giant in 1991.
The names, who guarantee the insurance contracts with unlimited liability  on their personal wealth, are already suffering difficulties repaying the five  billion pounds of losses registered by Lloyd's between 1988 and 1990.
Already 3,095 names are claiming 629 million pounds in damages for alleged  negligence and mismanagement by their 71 agents in one of the biggest lawsuits  in English history.
Agents do not underwrite personally but act as advisers to prospective  investors.
A total of eight names have allegedly committed suicide on account of  massive losses suffered under Lloyd's syndicates.
Last week, Lloyd's announced that it would authorise names to "borrow" up  to three percent of expected profits for 1994 to reinburse losses in 1991.
