Troubled Tottenham Hotspur received a new blow on  Wednesday when England winger Darren Anderton turned down a two year extension  to his contract.
Anderton, 22, who scored his first goal for his country in the 5-0 win  over Greece on Tuesday, is contracted to White Hart Lane until 1996.
He asked chairman Alan Sugar for a new deal but the offer did not meet  expectations.
Anderton, who joined Spurs for 1.75 million pounds from First Division  Portsmouth two years ago, said: "He made it clear that the offer was a final  one, that I should take it or leave it and I have decided to leave it."
Anderton says he will stay at the club but he admitted: "I feel a bit let  down."
It is the second contract controversy to hit Tottenham in 24 hours.
Skipper Gary Mabbutt, who suffered horrific facial injuries in an infamous  clash with Wimbledon's John Fashanu, has reportedly been told to expect only a  12-month extension offer, with no improved terms.
The London club is at the centre of an inquiry by the English football  authorities over allegations of illegal payments to players.
