Representative Dan Rostenkowski said Monday he  would fight charges he misused public funds, rather than accept a plea bargain  that would end the career of one of Congress' most influential members.
"I am confident that I will be vindicated and I look forward to the return  of the gavel," said Rostenkowski, 66, who heads the lower chamber's powerful  Ways and Means Committee.
Prosecutors had given the Illinois Democrat until Tuesday to decide  whether to accept a plea bargain which force him to resign but let him off  with a short prison term or face several felony counts and a lengthy trial.
Sources said Rostenkowski is to be indicted on charges he defrauded  taxpayers of hundreds of thousands of dollars by hiring ghost employees and  trading House of Representatives post office stamps for cash.
President Bill Clinton is counting on Rostenkowski, who has served in  Congress for 36 years, to push his crucial health care reform bill through  Congress.
