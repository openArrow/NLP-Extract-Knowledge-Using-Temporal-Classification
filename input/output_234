The Indian government will not privatise the two  state-owned airlines, Air India and Indian Airlines, until their services  improve, federal civil aviation secretary K. Padmanabhiah said here Friday.
He said the government had delayed plans to sell a part of its 100 percent  stake in both airlines and float a Euroissue to raise funds for ambitious  expansion plans.
"The privatisation will not proceed till we improve the quality of our  product," Padmanabhiah, who is also chairman of both airlines, said.
"Most of the year we are handling labour problems instead of improving the  quality of the service. This must end, and the employees must see the writing  in the skies," he said, referring to increased competition by private airlines  on the domestic sector.
Padmanabhiah revealed that Air India had carried 2.2 million passengers in  1992-93 against 2.1 million in 1987-88.
"There is no appreciable growth as the number of seats and schedules had  not gone up," he said, adding that the airlines planned to buy five more  aircraft as part of their expansion plans.
Padmanabhiah also unveiled Friday a frequent-flier program by both  airlines for passengers flying to overseas destinations.
The program called "flying returns" will be launched on June 1 and will  initialy be limited to Indian residents, he said.
He said the two airlines will also shortly operate a world-wide advanced  reservation system to attract more passengers.
Air India is the single largest airline operating out of India. Indian  Airlines, until recently the monopoly domestic carrier, also operates  international flights.
