A man was killed Friday and a woman and two  children were wounded when a bomb exploded in their car in the Northern  Ireland town of Lurgan, police said.
Police could not confirm the identities of the four or say if they  belonged to the same family, although informed sources said the man was a  member of the British security forces.
The bomb went off as the four were getting into the car Friday morning in  Lurgan, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) southwest of Belfast.
One of the children suffered multiple fractures, police said, but the  condition of the other two injured persons was not immediately known.
Late Thursday, a 23-year-old Catholic man was shot and killed by suspected  Protestant militants in north Belfast and Sunday an elderly Catholic man was  murdered in his home in the western town of Dungannon by members of the  Protestant Ulster Volunteer Force.
