PLO leader Yasser Arafat said here Friday, as  Palestinian police took control of Jericho, that he aimed to travel to the  West Bank town in mid-June.
The Palestinians will hold elections "very soon," following the launch of  self-rule in Jericho and the Gaza Strip, he told reporters at PLO headquarters  in the Tunisian capital.
But Arafat said he was "not in a hurry" to complete the line-up of the  24-member Palestinian Authority to run Gaza and Jericho. So far, 15 members  have been named to the team, which the PLO leader is to chair.
Arafat and the European Commission vice president, Manuel Marin, earlier  signed accords for 12 million dollars in EU aid for the new Palestinian police  force and two million dollars to hold the elections.
