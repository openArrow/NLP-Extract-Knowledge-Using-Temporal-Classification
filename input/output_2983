Spain's Javier Sanchez grabbed the  limelight from his better-known siblings for once when he beat compatriot  Alberto Berasategui, the top seed, in the final of the Bologna tournament on  Sunday.
Sanchez, the brother of Emilio Sanchez and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, won  7-6 (7/3), 4-6, 6-3 on a stiflingly hot afternoon to repeat his success here  in 1989.
He had failed to win in five final appearances since then.
"Bologna is a lucky town for me but I hope I won't have to wait another  five years to win again," the Spaniard said.
