Michael Chang, bidding to regain the French Open  title he won in 1989, survived an early lapse in a start-stop clash with Jordi  Arrese to march impressively into the third round on Wednesday.
A frustrating series of interruptions for rain meant that the 2h 47min  Chang spent on court compiling his 4-6, 6-0, 6-4, 6-2 victory was spread over  nearly seven hours.
Fired up by a series of careless errors that cost him the first set 4-6 on  a a tenth game break, Chang rattled through the second set in just 20 minutes  only to be held in check by the first of three rain-breaks.
The first lasted only minutes but it was enough to break the Chinese  American's concentration and when he returned the intensity had gone out of  his game.
Arrese had just saved a break point in the first game of the third set  when they were forced off for the first time.
When they came back the Spaniard held his serve and came back into the  match only to be thrown off the rails himself by the second break, which came  with Chang about to serve at 2-3 in the third.
Chang clinched the third 6-4 and was within two games of victory at 4-2 in  the fourth when the rain once again sent the players scurrying for the shelter  of the changing rooms.
This time the break lasted three hours and with further rain threatening  Chang obviously had no intention of getting involved in a fifth act of the  drama.
He pounced on a short Arrese ball to seal a break and then served out for  the match with three service winners in the final game.
Chang, seeded eighth, plays Perus's Jaime Yzaga or the American Jared  Palmer for a place in the last 16.
