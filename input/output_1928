Japan's big trading houses said Thursday they  expected earnings to rebound after a dismal year in which profits were  squeezed by investment losses and lower revenue from most activities except  metal trading.
Seven of the nation's nine largest trading companies suffered declines in  pre-tax earnings in the year to March with only two -- Marubeni Corp. and  Tomen Corp. -- posting higher profits during the period.
Itochu Corp., the biggest, saw its profit dive 38.3 percent to 30.8  billion yen (299 million dollars) on sales of 16,135 billion yen, down 12.9  percent.
The company forecast improved earnings of 36 billion yen for this year  despite a lower sales projection of 16,000 billion yen.
"Affected by the recession here, the stronger yen and the fall in oil  prices, sales remained stagnant throughout the year. Trading with other  countries declined as a result of the nation's reduced export activity,  particularly car shipments to the United States and Europe," the company said.
Mitsui and Co. Ltd. said its earnings tumbled 21.5 percent to 46.5 billion  yen on sales of 15,863 billion yen, up 2.4 percent and supported by a surge in  revenue from non-ferrous metals trading.
The company forecast a modest increase in profit to 47 billion yen in the  current year, although sales are projected to retreat to 15,000 billion yen.
"We received considerably large orders for power plants from the Middle  East. But transactions in other products such as cars, machinery and steel  remained slow. Stagnant imports of oil, gas, steel and foodstuffs offset brisk  imports of aircraft and electronics products," Mitsui said.
Sumitomo Corp., the only company to announce consolidated figures, said  group profits before tax declined 6.5 percent from a year earlier to 42.2  billion yen. Worldwide sales slipped 5.7 percent to 17,000 billion yen,  depressed by lower revenue from all areas except metals.
For the current year, however, the company forecast improved earnings of  45 billion yen on increased sales of 17,500 billion yen.
Marubeni said its pre-tax earnings climbed 10 percent to 41.1 billion yen  despite lower sales, which dropped 10.1 percent to 15,156 billion yen.
The company attributed its higher pre-tax earnings to cost-cutting efforts  and increased non-operating profits.
But Marubeni forecast lower earnings of 38 billion yen for the current  year on increased sales of 15,500 billion yen.
Mitsubishi Corp. said its earnings tumbled 33.4 percent to 50.3 billion  yen on sales which were down 5.8 percent to 14,123 billion yen. It forecast a  higher profit of 53 billion yen in the current year but projected a further  decline in sales to 13,000 billion yen.
Among the smaller trading houses, Nissho Iwai Corp. said its earnings fell  9.6 percent from a year earlier to 14 billion yen with sales dropping 5.5  percent to 9,588 billion yen in the same period.
The company forecast improved earnings of 15 billion yen for the current  year with sales projected to rise to 10,000 billion yen.
Tomen Corp. said its earnings jumped 17.2 percent to 13.7 billion yen on  sales of 6,522 billion yen, down 7.7 percent. The profit gain reflected  cost-cutting efforts and brisk machinery orders from overseas, it said.
The company forecast a lower profit of 12.5 billion yen for the current  year but projected increased sales of 6,700 billion yen.
Nichimen Corp. said its profit tumbled 29.1 percent to 12.4 billion yen on  sales of 5,488 billion yen, down 9.3 percent. The company projected a further  decline in earnings to 10 billion yen for the current year but forecast  increased sales of 5,500 billion yen.
Kanematsu Corp. said its pre-tax earnings plunged 65 percent to 3.3  billion yen in the year to March. Revenue slipped three percent in the same  period to some 5,700 billion yen. The company forecast a bigger profit of six  billion yen for this year with revenue stagnating at around the same level as  last year.
