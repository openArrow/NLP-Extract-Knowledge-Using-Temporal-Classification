Japanese corporate failures rose 1.9 percent from a  year earlier to 1,276 cases in April, boosted by the growing number of  recession-linked insolvencies, a private credit research agency said Tuesday.
Teikoku Bank Ltd. said the number of failures, defined as insolvencies  with liabilities of at least 10 million yen (96,000 dollars), exceeded 1,000  cases for the 15th month in a row.
Combined liabilities meanwhile grew 6.9 percent from a year earlier to 361  billion yen, but were down 22.2 percent from March, partly due to a decline in  large failures, the agency said.
The number of recession-induced failures -- attributed to such factors as  sluggish sales and exports, difficulties in collecting bills and the  accumulation of bad debts -- rose 7.1 percent from a year earlier to 755 cases.
Such failures accounted for 64.2 percent of the total, the third highest  on record and the ninth month in a row that the ratio has topped 60 percent.
The agency noted that views towards the Japanese economy were mixed.
"Steady public works investment and household spending are seen as a  bright factor," it said. But weak capital investment and the strong yen were  seen as negative factors.
The agency said an additional negative factor was the parliamentary delay  in passing the national budget for the fiscal year which began April 1.
