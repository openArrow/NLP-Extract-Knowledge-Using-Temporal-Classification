Three of four hostage takers who fled to the rebel  republic of Chechenya aboard a helicopter with hostages and eight million  dollars in ransom money aboard were arrested there Friday, the ITAR-TASS news  agency reported.
The gunmen hijacked a bus to the Caucasus town of Mineralnye Vody  Thursday, taking schoolchildren, parents and teachers hostage. They flew to  the Chechnya town of Bacha-Yurt, about 15 kilometers (seven miles) from the  border of neighbouring Dagestan, an official said.
No news was immediately available on the fate of the fourth kidnapper or  the hostages, three women and a man.
