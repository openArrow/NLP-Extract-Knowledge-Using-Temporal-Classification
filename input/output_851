Illegal sales continued to plague China's gold  sector in the first quarter of 1994, with state purchases unchanged despite a  17 percent jump in output over the same period last year, it was reported  Monday.
Sales to the state, unchanged on 1993, were down 35 percent on the first  three months of 1992, the China Daily quoted Ministry of Metallurgical  Industry gold bureau vice president Cui Dewen as saying.
Cui blamed the drop on a booming illegal trade between gold producers and  processing factories, which offer higher prices than the central bank.
Last year, gold sales to the state plunged 40 percent on 1992, the first  fall in 15 years.
The government tried to reverse the trend in September by raising its  purchasing price from 51.2 yuan (8.80 dollars) to 96 yuan (16.70 dollars) a  gram, in line with the world market.
However, when the value on the London gold market subsequently climbed,  the Chinese government failed to keep its pledge to peg its purchase price to  this level, forcing sellers back to the black market.
Processing factories, which buy gold from the central bank for 110 yuan  per gram, use the black market to make up for inadequate state supply.
Cui said the gold bureau and central bank would meet soon to discuss ways  to protect the country's gold resources and encourage producers to sell their  output to the state.
The market price of gold jewellery is about 140 yuan per gram.
