An Italian neo-fascist candidate running in the  upcoming European elections is suggesting that homosexuals be interned while  his party newspaper, Il Secolo, said that homosexuality was a crime.
According to a press report, Piero Buscaroli, the candidate from the  neo-fascist National Alliance, believes that homosexuals should be placed in  concentration camps and should be identified as "faggots" or "queens."
His party newspaper, Il Secolo, supported his declarations saying that his  only crime was expressing what every man on the street believes.
The newspaper added that "if homesexuality is considered a (legal) right,  then so should rape, incest and bestiality."
Franco Grillini, head of a homosexual organization, is planning to file a  complaint against the paper and Buscaroli, the daily La Stampa reported Monday.
