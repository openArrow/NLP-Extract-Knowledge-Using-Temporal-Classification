Former captain Jean-Francois Tordo makes  his comeback for France against Canada B here on Wednesday almost one year to  the day after his face was ripped open in South Africa.
A knee ligament operation forced him to miss last season's Five Nations  tournament when he had recovered from the Springbok raking.
He returns as captain as Philippe Saint Andre takes a breather after  losing last Saturay's French championship final.
Four players make their international debut -- right wing Laurent  Leflamand, halfbacks Benoit Bellot (a last-minute addition to the tour) and  Guy Accoceberry, and No 8 Sylvain Dispagne.
Franck Mesnel is back at centre while Olivier Brouzet and Marc Cecillon  form an untested second row. The 34-year-old Cecillon's international career  looked over when he was dropped midway through the Five Nations tournament  after playing almost exclusively in the back row.
