At least three people died but more than 500 were  rescued when fire swept through a Red Sea ferry off the Egyptian coast on  Thursday, the transport ministry said.
Around 50 of the 535 saved had been injured, while the remainder of the  589 passengers and crew were still unaccounted for as rescue operations  continued.
The Qamar al-Saudi was travelling from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to Suez, in  Egypt, when an explosion in the engine room caused the fire which spread  rapidly, rescue services said.
The "fire has completely gutted the ship," said rescue official Ahmed  Nabil, from the Egyptian Red Sea port of Hurghada.
Passengers escaped on life boats and were picked up by an American  warship, the USS Newport, and a merchant ship.
Most of those on board were Egyptian workers returning home for the Moslem  feast of Eid.
The blast happened just before midnight after the ferry had dropped 527  passengers at the Egyptian Red Sea port of Safaga, 600 kilometres (370 miles)  southeast of Cairo and entered the Gulf of Suez.
The Qamar-al-Saudi had already hit a reef in March in the same stretch of  water but nobody was hurt. It had also collided with a Norwegian ship in 1991.
In December 1991 another ferry on the same route, the Salem Express, hit a  coral reef off the Egyptian coast, officially causing the deaths of 471,  although more were believed to have been lost.
