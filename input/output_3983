US troops were exposed to Iraqi chemical and  possibly biological agents during the Gulf war leaving tens of thousands of  veterans with debilitating illnesses, a congressional study released Thursday  concluded.
Senator Donald Riegle, who released the study, sharply criticises the  Pentagon for foot-dragging and suggested it was withholding information on  exposure of US forces to biological material.
"The contents of this report supports the conclusion that US forces were  exposed to some level of chemical and possibly biological warfare agents  during their service in the Gulf war," Riegle, a Democrat from Michigan, said  at a hearing on Capitol Hill.
Riegle's report said tens of thousands of veterans of the war were  suffering from a variety of debilitating conditions known as Gulf War Syndrome.
They include muscle and joint pain, memory loss, intestinal and heart  proplems, fatigue, nasal congestion, diahorrea and rashes.
Edwin Dorn, Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness said  that the Pentagon knew of only 2,000 such casesd.
"We have concluded that Iraq did not use chemical or biological weapons  during the war," Dorn said.
