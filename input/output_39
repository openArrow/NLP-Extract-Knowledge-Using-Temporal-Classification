Under last week's PLO-Israel accord on implementing limited Palestinian  self-rule in the Gaza strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, the authority  is due to take over on May 25.
Meanwhile in Jerusalem a police spokesman said Rabin had agreed to a draft  plan to set up a special police section to deal specifically with issues  relating to Palestinian autonomy.
Under the project devised by Police Minister Moshe Shahal 2,000 men will  be temporarily based in the Maalei Adumin settlement in the occupied West Bank.
The spokesman said its role would be to supervise the organisation of  Israeli-Palestinian patrols in Gaza and Jericho.
The partial list announcement came as 20 Palestinian policemen arrived in  the Jericho region, and another group of 300 policemen was due to be deployed  in Gaza later on Thursday following the initial 300.
Palestinian police chief Nasr Yussef said the Israeli pullout from Gaza  and Jericho would be finished by next Wednesday.
In all, 9,000 Palestinian policemen are due to be deployed in Gaza and  Jericho.
