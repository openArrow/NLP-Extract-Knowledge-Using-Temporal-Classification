The candidate of the ruling Christian Union  parties, Roman Herzog, led through a second-round vote by a special federal  assembly here Monday to choose a new German head of state, winning 622 out of  1,318 votes.
But he failed to win the absolute majority to be sure of succeeding  Richard von Weizsaecker as federal president.
The Social Democrats' candidate Johannes Rau won 559 votes and the liberal  Free Democrats' candidate Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher won 126. The far-right  Republicans candidate Hans Hirzel won 11 votes.
The independent candidate Jens Reich who won 62 votes in the first round  withdrew before the second round.
The contest now goes on to a third and decisive round of voting when a  simple majority will decide and the attitude of the Free Democrats will likely  determine the outcome.
