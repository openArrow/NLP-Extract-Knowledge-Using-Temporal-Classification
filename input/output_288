Islamic nations stand ready to provide peacekeeping  troops to defend the people of Bosnia-Hercegovina if western UN forces are  withdrawn, Pakistani ambassador Hamad Kamal said Friday.
Kamal was speaking after representatives of the 51-state Organization of  the Islamic Conference (OIC) met in urgent session in Geneva and expressed  "deep concerns" at the state of peace negotiations for Bosnia.
The Islamic gathering came as West European, US and Russian foreign  ministers also met in the city in a fresh effort to agree a workable peace,  amid threats to withdraw UN forces if no formula is found rapidly.
Kamal read an OIC statement noting "the threat of certain countries to  withdraw their peacekeeping contingents." France which has the biggest  contingent has threatened withdrawal failing a rapid solution.
The OIC statement warned against such action without analysis of its  impact on the situation on the ground and the drafting in of replacement  troops, "for which adequate offers already exist from several OIC member  states."
The Pakistani ambassador added that said while the OIC considered the  lives of UN troops in Bosnia important, "we believe that the lives of the  people in Bosnia-Hercegovina are even more important."
Kamal also said a Malaysian major killed in Bosnia Thursday had died "in  defence of the principles the OIC upholds in Bosnia."
Paying tribute to the same officer, Bosnian ambassador Mohamed Sacirbey  distinguished between countries which provided UN troops "mandated to defend  civilians under attack" and those which "mandated soldiers to remain neutral."
Sacirbey interpreted Thursday's US Senate vote calling for lifting of the  arms embargo on Bosnia as a sign of concern at the "failure to provide balance  to the military situation" and as a result influence the negotiations.
"The Bosnians do not just have friends in the Islamic world. They have  friends in the highest institutions that represent democracy in the US and the  world in general," he told the OIC press conference.
In its statement the OIC, which has called for the lifting of the embargo  on arms supplies to Bosnia, "regretted the exclusion of OIC representatives"  from the so-called "contact group" meeting on Bosnia in Geneva.
The statement reaffirmed that OIC representatives should participate on an  equal footing with those of other countries in the peace efforts.
While maintaining their offer of active participation, it said that  "continued rejection of this offer could adversely impact upon the credibility  and sustainability of any solutions worked out in their absence."
The OIC statement warned that a durable and just peace could not be  achieved without ensuring the sovereignty and territorial integrity of   Bosnia-Hercegovina and the return of territories seized through aggression,  ethnic cleansing or genocide.
