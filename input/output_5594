An 11-year-old boy, three women  and a man drowned as strong undercurrents plagued beaches in northeastern  Florida during the Memorial Day holiday, authorities said.
Six other people were taken to area hospitals where one woman was in  serious condition and a man was in stable condition. The other four were  released, fire and rescue Chief Michael Green said Monday.
"We think one boy got in trouble and they all tried to help," he said.
"We have undertows here from time to time, but this was a particularly bad  one," Green said.
He said there are no lifeguards on Nassau County beaches; just signs  saying "swim at your own risk."
