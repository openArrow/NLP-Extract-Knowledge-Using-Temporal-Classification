Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin arrived  here Thursday for a official visit, the first by a Russian premier since the  collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the offcial news agency Xinhua said.
The four-day visit aims at strengthening economic and trade relations,  culminating in the signature of several agreements, it said.
"Russia and China are traditionally friendly neighbours. The two countries  should maintain and further enhance their normal and friendly relations,"  Chernomyrdin was quoted as saying on his arrival.
Chernomyrdin was scheduled to meet his Chinese counterpart Li Peng after  touring the Great Wall and the Forbidden City on Thursday. Talks have also  been scheduled with head of state and communist party chief Jiang Zemin.
The Russian premier was also to travel to Dalian in the northeast and to  Shanghai before leaving China.
The visit comes on the heels of a visit here last week by a Russian  parliamentary delegation, and coincides with the second session of a joint  commission aimed at boosting bilateral trade.
Chernomyrdin was flanked by a large group of advisors and business  executives.
