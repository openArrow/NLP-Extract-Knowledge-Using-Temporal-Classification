Turkish warplanes attacked a Kurdish rebel camp at  Zaleh in northern Iraq on Wednesday, in the second such cross-border raid this  year, military headquarters here said.
It said 19 aircraft took part in the attack 110 kilometres (70 miles) from  the border, but had no immediate word on the outcome.
The first cross-border air raid at the end of January was described by the  military as their biggest air strike against the rebels of the Kurdistan  Workers Party (PKK) in the 10 years of the movement's separatist insurrection.
Government officials meanwhile said 86 PKK fighters had been killed since  Monday in security force operations in south-eastern Turkey, where Kurds are  the majority of the population.
Officials enforcing emergency regulations in the region said a large  amount of weapons had been captured.
The army has stepped up sweeps since the end of March in a major push to  finish with the rebels once and for all, according to official briefings.
