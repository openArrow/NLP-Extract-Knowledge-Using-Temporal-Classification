Inflation was running at 2.9 percent in  western Germany in May, the federal statistics office said on Thursday giving  provisional figures.
If confirmed, it would be the first time for three years that the rate has  fallen below three percent. The figure has not been so low since April 1991  when it was 2.8 percent.
In March 1992 the inflation rate reached a high point of 4.8 percent.
Consumer prices in western Germany rose by 0.2 percent in May compared  with the figure a month earlier and were up by 2.9 percent compared with May  1993, the statistics office said.
The consumer price index for western Germany had also grown by 0.2 percent  in April, when the year-on-year inflation was 3.1 percent.
The provisional index issued on Thursday is based on a monitor of prices  in four of the main regional states of west Germany. The definitive figure  will be announced in mid-June.
German economic statistics continue to be given separately for the two  parts of the country reunited in 1990 because of their very differing economic  background and situation.
The latest statistics for the formerly communist east, where inflation has  also fallen latterly after soaring to over 15 percent after reunification,  showed consumer prices rising there at a rate of 3.3 percent in April.
