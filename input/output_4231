Britain on Thursday lifted the arms embargo it  imposed against Israel in 1982 in response to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said in a written statement to the House of  Commons: "I have decided that, in light of favourable developments in the  Middle East peace process, in particular the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and  Jericho, the United Kingdom's arms embargo against Israel should be lifted."
"This will bring the United Kingdom into line with European Union  partners."
A Foreign Office spokesman said the lifting of the embargo would take  effect immediately.
Hurd, who was in Paris on Thursday, said in the written statement that a  European Union arms embargo imposed against Syria in 1986 as a result of  Syria's involvement in terrorism might also be reconsidered.
"Forthwith," said Hurd, "all applications for sale of arms to Israel will  be considered case by case in the light of the international guidelines to  which we are committed.
"These include whether a proposed transfer would be likely to increase  tension in the region or contribute to regional instability."
The spokesman said no applications for such sales were immediately pending.
Hurd said the Israeli government "has made it clear that it has no  territorial claim on Lebanon."
Israel, however, has maintained a "security zone" in southern Lebanon.
Hurd said Britain would be "ready to raise with our European partners the  lifting of the European Union arms embargo against Syria..." if there is  "progress on the Syrian track in line with that seen on the Palestinian track."
