The growth of the German M3 money  supply is the main cause for concern at the Bundesbank, a member of the bank's  policy-making central council Reimut Jochimsen said on Wednesday.
The Bundesbank published figures on Tuesday showing that M3 had grown at  an annual rate of 15.8 percent in April from 15.4 percent in March and 17.5  percent in February. The bank has set a target for this year of growth of  4.0-6.0 percent.
Jochimsen said that the high rate of growth was caused in part by  exceptional factors such a big demand for home loans owing to changes in  taxation at the end of 1993.
Another factor was an inflow of funds from Luxembourg owing also to  changes in taxation.
But structural factors, such as a persistent increase in demand for loans  from the public sector, were also contributing to the growth of M3, he said.
This structural cause "is not easy to eliminate and will therefore have an  effect on M3 for some time yet," he said, noting that the public-sector debt  was a cause of "great concern" to him and to other members of the central  council.
Jochimsen is also president of the central bank for the regional state of  North Rhine-Westphalia.
He described the outlook for the economy as a whole as "very positive"  mainly because of a big increase in orders from abroad, a good performance by  the building sector in Germany and a slowing of inflation.
The current exchange rate of the mark to the dollar reflected "more the  strength of the mark than the weakness of the dollar", he said.
Trade tension between Japan and the United States was a significant force  behind volatility on foreign exchange markets" and the problems should be  resolved as soon as possible, he said.
