Italy's best known Mafia turncoat, Tommaso Buscetta,  claims in a book soon to be published that the 1962 death of Enrico Mattei,  the former head of the state-owned energy conglomerate ENI, was orchestrated  by the American Mafia.
His revelation in the book, titled "Goodbye Cosa Nostra. The Life of  Tommaso Buscetta" and written by Pino Arlacchi, a university professor who  specializes in organized crime, sheds light on a case never resolved by  authorities.
Mattei was killed in a mysterious plane crash in 1962.
"Mattei was killed on orders of the American Mafia because his policies  hurt American (oil) interests in the Middle East," Buscetta is quoted as  saying in the book.
Mattei in the 1950s undercut the solidarity of oil-purchasing countries by  offering higher prices to oil-producing nations. His life story was chronicled  in the movie "Il Caso Mattei" (The Mattei Case).
Buscetta, in the book, also sheds light on the 1970 disappearance of Mauro  De Mauro, a reporter who was investigating Mattei's death.
He is quoted as saying that Mafia godfather Stefano Bontade "learned that  Mauro was getting too close to the truth, meaning the role he played in  Mattei's death, and thus organised Mauro's kidnapping."
Mauro's disappearance and Mattei's death were never resolved by police and  most of those involved in the investigation have since died.
