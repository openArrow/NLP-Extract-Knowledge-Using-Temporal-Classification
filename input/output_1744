Russia and Pakistan are discussing details of a  comprehensive cooperation treaty likely to be signed when Prime Minister  Benazir Bhutto visits Moscow, officials said Wednesday.
Foreign Minister Assef Ahmed Ali is to travel to Moscow in July to, among  other things, finalize the dates for Bhutto's visit, they said.
Contacts between the two countries are said to have received a boost from  the just-concluded talks here of Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly  Adamishin.
The highlight of Adamishin's visit was the release of two Russian  prisoners of war by Afghan Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar with help from  Pakistan.
The prisoners, who were captured by Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami faction  during the 1979-1989 Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan, were handed  over to the Russian official by Bhutto here Monday.
