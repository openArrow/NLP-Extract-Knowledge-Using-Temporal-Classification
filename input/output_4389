The Spanish Grand Prix was under threat  here on Thursday after Formula One's drivers and team bosses considered a  boycott following a row over new safety measures.
The drivers, who agreed to meet again on Friday, have yet to be convinced  the circuit for Sunday's race is safe, while their managers looked on course  for a trial-of-strength with governing body FIA.
Benetton boss Flavio Briatore, who on Wednesday attacked FIA's car  specification changes following the deaths of drivers Ayrton Senna and Roland  Ratzenberger at Imola, was in the spotlight again after his cars were ruled  not to meet the new regulations.
FIA also looked set to try and force Briatore to back down after he  demanded president Max Mosley should be held responsible for any accidents  during the Spanish race.
If Briatore refuses, Benetton's German driver Michael Schumacher, who has  won the first four races this season, could be stopped from racing.
Briatore had argued Mosley did not understand the technical problems of  rushing through new rules on aerodynamics and engine power and argued they  made the cars more and not less dangerous because they were harder to control.
The drivers, meanwhile, argued on Thursday that safety changes to  circuit's chicane had not been carried out.
Gerhard Berger, representative for the revived Grand Prix Drivers'  Association (GPDA), said: "We have tried to find a solution and we have found  a compromise to slow down the cars because it's difficult to change the  chicane because of limited space.
"We will meet again on Friday to see if the necessary changes have been  made."
