Mark Duper, once a star receiver with the  Miami Dolphins, was arrested Friday when he tried to buy a kilogram of  cocaine, police said.
Duper, 35, was arrested at a hotel in a sting operation organized by the  US Drug Enforcement Administration and local police.
A DEA spokesman said Duper apparently planned to take the cocaine to his  home state of Louisiana, convert it to crack cocaine and sell it.
Duper and his brother-in-law Brian Briggs were both in custody. The DEA  said they would likely face charges of conspiracy to possess cocaine with  intent to distribute it.
Duper, who legally changed his middle name to Super at the height of his  NFL fame, was cut by the Dolphins last summer. He signed with Cincinnati but  was cut before the season started.
He recently signed with the Shreveport, Louisiana, Pirates, one of the  Candian Football League's US expansion clubs.
