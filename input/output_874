Three pieces of heavy weaponry have been sighted  by UN military observers in a Serb-controlled neighborhood in Sarajevo, UN  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) officials said here Monday.
The location of the weapons -- two mortar guns and an anti-aircraft canon  -- is in violation of the UN-imposed 20-kilometre (12-mile) exclusion zone  around Sarajevo.
UNPROFOR spokesman Rob Annink said the two mortar guns were sighted Sunday  in Grbavica, a neighborhood overlooking the capital.
Another UN military source who requested anonymity said the anti-aircraft  gun was also found in the same neighborhood which is under the control of  Bosnian Serbs.
The Serbs earlier this month managed to sneak a tank into the region.
The tank, a T-34, disappeared while being transported on a truck from  Bosnian Serb headquarters at Pale in violation of the exclusion zone barring  heavy weaponry around Sarajevo.
