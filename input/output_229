Delegates at the Asian Football Confederation  congress dealt a humiliatig blow to Japan's high-profile 2002 World Cup bid  Friday, when they rejected the country's top official Tadao Murata in two  high-profile elections.
Murata, secretary general of Japan's 2002 bidding committee, polled only  two out of 32 votes in the bitter battle for FIFA's vice-presidency which was  won by his arch-rival South Korean Chung Moon-Jung with 11 votes.
Murata, who used English soccer legend Bobby Charlton and free bottles of  12-year-old malt whisky as campaign tools, was further stunned when he again  came last in polling for his old seat as one of the AFC's four vice-presidents.
"I learned a lot of things today," said Murata after a roller-coaster day  of elections which saw only one incumbent AFC official out of six secure  re-election.
Murata's defeat means Japan, one of Asia's soccer powerhouses after the  launch of the popular J-League last year, has no senior official in the AFC  for the first time since Murata first became AFC vice-president in 1964.
Commenting on a dramatic day in which 36 candidates were jostling for 17  elected positions, FIFA General Secretary Sepp Blatter said, "I just felt it  from the very moment I arrived here that this was going to be an exciting  election.
There was a measure of good news for both Japan and South Korea's World  Cup campaigns when Blatter told a press conference on Friday that FIFA  definetely wanted to stage the 2002 World Cup in Asia.
