Canada has written off half of the debt it is owed  by the Ivory Coast, around 58 million US dollars, and has rescheduled the  other half over 23 years, Ivory Coast Economy and Finance Minister Niamien  N'Goran said Friday.
The first repayments of the rescheduled debt will fall due after a six  year grace period, he said.
"Canada has just shown us proof of its willingness to help us get through  these difficult times," he said at a ceremony to sign the agreement.
