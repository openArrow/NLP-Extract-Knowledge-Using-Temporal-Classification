Hakeem Olajuwon scored 37 points and  grabbed 17 rebounds Saturday to lead the Houston Rockets to a 104-94 victory  over Phoenix and a place in the semi-finals of the National Basketball  Association playoffs.
Phoenix' Charles Barkley was ejected, along with Houston's Vernon Maxwell,  with less than eight seconds left in the game when the Rockets' lead was  secure.
Barkley, a member of the US 'Dream Team' at the Barcelona Olympics, fouled  Olajuwon hard while Olajuwon was dunking. Maxwell rushed in to protest and  Barkley shoved him.
The ignominious exit may prove to be Barkley's last NBA controversy, since  he has said several times he planned to retire at the end of the season.
The Rockets will meet Utah in the Western Conference finals, with the  winners going on to the championship series against the Eastern Conference  champs.
Houston became the second team in the history of the NBA to lose the first  two games of a best-of-seven series at home and come back to win.
They erased the painful memories of their losses earlier in the series,  when they blew big leads late in the games to draw the derision of their home  fans.
