The Crimean parliament voted Friday to  re-establish a 1992 constitution which provides for treaty relations between  the Crimean republic and Ukraine, thus giving Crimea independent status.
It is now an autonomous republic within Ukraine.
The constitution was never applied since the Crimean parliament amended it  under pressure from Ukrainian authorities.
