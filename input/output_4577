Fears that the Spanish Grand Prix may be  cancelled were lifted on Friday when motor racing chief Max Mosley met rebel  team chiefs.
"I think thay are going to race under the scheduled formula," the  International Automobile Federation said after meeting the sport's top team  chiefs who had refused to race under the new regulations.
"We listened to everyone's point of view," he said after a frank exchange  with Benetton, Williams, McLaren, Lotus, Ligier and Footwork chiefs.
Frank Williams and McLaren managing director Ron Dennis had backed  Benetton chief Flavio Briatore when the Italian's cars failed scrutineering.
However, Briatore later indicated he would race under the new rules when  he told marshalls he accepted responsibility for the Benetton cars' safety.
The new measures, designed to cut engine power and reduce aerodynamic  efficiency, had been rushed in following the deaths of Brazilian Ayrton Senna  and Austrian Roland Ratzenberger at Imola and the Monaco crash which ended  with Karl Wendlinger in a coma.
However, the team chiefs claimed the changes made the cars even more  dangerous because they had not had time to test them properly.
