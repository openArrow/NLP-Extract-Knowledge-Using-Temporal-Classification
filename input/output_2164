Japanese consul Michiko Fukuzawa was  stabbed to death with a screw driver by assailants who broke into her  apartment and looted it of money, jewels and electrical appliances, police  said Thursday.
Neighbors who noticed that the apartment's service door was ajar  discovered Fukuzawa's body in the bathroom, where she had been stabbed in the  head and the kneck with a screw driver, police said.
The 52-year-old diplomat had lived alone in the Saint Lorrain apartment  building in the central Belem neighborhood of Nazareth since 1990.
Police arrested an employee of the building, Josiel Reis Queiros, whose  tennis shoes matched a print left in the bathroom. Two other people were being  sought.
It was unknown how many people took part in the killing, which police  estimate took place in the early Wednesday evening.
Police said the killers smashed in the door to the apartment.
Large sums in US, Japanese and Brazilian currency were taken from the  apartment as were jewels and electrical appliances.
The building's porter, Manoel Lourenco, said Fukuzawa arrived at the  building at around 6:00 p.m. Wednesday accompanied by two men, who entered and  left the apartment twice.
Police believe the two men were employees of a moving company Fukuzawa  hired to move her belongings to Montevideo, where she was to assume the post  of first secretary at the Japanese embassy.
She planned to move over the weekend to Montevideo and for several days  had been packing her belongings.
The Brazilian foreign ministry said its legal department was following the  police investigations in Belem at the request of the Japanese Foreign Ministry.
