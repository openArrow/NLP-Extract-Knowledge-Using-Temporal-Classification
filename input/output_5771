France hopes to establish close relations with the  new socialist government in Hungary, which in time should join the European  Union, foreign ministry spokesman Richard Duque said here Tuesday.
Duque added that France would continue to support the reform process in  the former communist country and Hungary's bid to join the union.
Hungary's Socialist Party (MSZP) won an absolute majority after the second  round of general elections Sunday.
The elections were the second since the fall of the communist regime there  in 1989.
