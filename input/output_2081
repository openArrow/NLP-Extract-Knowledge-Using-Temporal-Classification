The Israeli army announced Thursday  that non-Palestinian civilians could cross the autonomous enclave of Jericho  in convoys of at least five vehicles.
Israelis will have to fill out a form at the roadblock into the West Bank  town stating the time and number of passengers per car. The forms are handed  in to Israeli border guards at the exit point.
However, Israeli buses still have to use a military track around the  enclave.
The army had last week banned Israelis from entering Jericho which became  autonomous on Friday when Jewish forces pulled out.
