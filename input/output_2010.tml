A study by Otago University <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">found</EVENT> 90 percent of the 356 players <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">involved</EVENT>  in club rugby here <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE">last winter season</TIMEX3> were <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">injured</EVENT> at some point during <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION">the  season</TIMEX3>.&#13;
Yvonne Bird <EVENT eid="e9" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">told</EVENT> the Physical Education New Zealand conference that men  players who undertook endurance training like <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">running</EVENT>, <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">swimming</EVENT> and aerobics  to <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">improve</EVENT> their fitness <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">decreased</EVENT> their risk of injury by 25 percent.&#13;
But men who undertook interval training, like circuit training and  sprints, and possibly over-trained, were twice as likely to be <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">injured</EVENT> than  those who did not <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="NEG" modality="none">train</EVENT>.&#13;
There was no significant difference between women who did train and those  who did not.&#13;
The study <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">showed</EVENT> most injuries (35.9 percent) <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">occurred</EVENT> in tackles. Just  over 15 percent of injuries <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">occurred</EVENT> during rucks and 11.3 percent in mauls.&#13;
Most of the injuries (74 percent) were soft tissue injuries: sprains,  strains and lacerations.&#13;
Ankle injuries (14 percent) were the most common while shoulder and  collarbone (12 percent) and face, outer ear and eye injuries (11 percent) were  next.&#13;
The higher the level the game was <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">played</EVENT> at, the greater the rate of  injuries.&#13;
The study also <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">showed</EVENT> that, for every 100 games of rugby among men, there  were 11.5 injuries, while the number <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">reduced</EVENT> to 6.4 injuries for every 100  games among women.&#13;
