A UN envoy called off a trip to Kigali on Monday  despite a shaky truce in Rwanda's embattled capital, saying neither rebels nor  government forces could guarantee his security.
The envoy, Iqbal Riza, was to have travelled to Kigali by road Monday to  continue discussions to pave the way for the return of UN peacekeepers to stem  ethnic slaughter in Rwanda.
But after talks in the morning with leaders of the rebel Rwanda Patriotic  Front (RPF) at their headquarters in Mulindi, northern Rwanda, Riza cancelled  the trip and returned to Uganda by helicopter, a UN spokesman said.
"We did not obtain explicit guarantees from the two parties about his  safety," spokesman Abdul Kabia said by telephone from Kigali, where fighting  tailed off despite sporadic gunfire.
Kabia said both sides had agreed to a two-day truce to allow Riza to hold  talks with rebel leaders and Rwanda's interim government on plans to deploy  5,500 UN troops to stem a six-week-old bloodbath in which up to half-a-million  people have been killed.
The rebels, however, said they had not agreed to a full truce, but had  agreed to hold fire wherever possible to allow Riza to travel safely.
But Riza was still concerned about negotiating a dangerous crossing just  outside Kigali, Kabia said.
"The truce is largely holding," Kabia said. "There are occasional  exchanges of fire, but there's a lot less fighting than usual and so we  consider that the truce is being respected."
