Canada's Paul Tracy, among the  Indianapolis 500 pole favorites, was declared medically unfit to drive here in  Saturday's time trials.
Tracy suffered concussion and a bruised left foot in a practice crash on  Friday and spent the night at Methodist Hospital.
Tracy was among three drivers using the Mercedes engine which has  dominated practice speeds this week over the 2.5-mile (4km) Indianapolis Motor  Speedway oval.
Doctors conducted neurological tests and x-rays on Tracy overnight and  ruled Saturday morning he was not yet ready to drive. His condition will be  re-evaluated Sunday.
Under Indy 500 qualifying rules, only qualifiers on the first day can  compete for the pole. Later qualifiers, even with faster speeds, must start  behind first-day qualifiers in the May 29 race.
Tracy skidded through the third-turn wall at 240 mph (384 km/h) on Friday,  hitting the outer wall of the fourth turn. He lost consciousness momentarily  during the crash, which caused extensive damage to his Mercedes-powered Penske  car.
A backup car has been prepared and tested, but forecasts of rain for  Sunday make it unlikely Tracy can make the field before next weekend's final  qualifying sessions.
