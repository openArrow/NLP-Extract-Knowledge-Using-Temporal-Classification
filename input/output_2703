The second round of peace talks between Sudan's  Islamic fundamentalist military government and the mainly Christian southern  rebels were adjourned Saturday after agreement on an agenda for the third  round talks to be held from July 18, the Kenyan foreign ministry said.
A statement said that after three days of intense negotiations behind  closed doors between representatives of the government and the two factions of  the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), the negotiators agreed on  "principles for resolving the conflict in southern Sudan and interim  arrangements and steps to be taken to resolve the conflict."
The talks were the latest in a series of so far fruitless efforts to  broker a peaceful settlement to the 11-year conflict by the Inter-Governmental  Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD), grouping Djibouti, Eritrea,  Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan and Uganda.
But according to the statement, the third negotiating session will be held  in Nairobi from July 18 to August 1 abd will be preceded by a meeting of the  Standing Committee of IGADD foreign affairs ministers scheduled for the Kenyan  capital on July 16.
The Sudanese government delegation at the second round of talks was headed  by parliamentary speaker Mohamed al-Amin Khalifa, while John Garang's SPLA  mainstream faction led by his deputy and chief of staff Salva Akiir and Riek  Machar's SPLA-United by Richard Mulla.
Also present Saturday was Ugandan Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister  Paulo Ssemogerere, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Mesfin Seyoum, Eritrean Foreign  Minister Petros Solomon and Kenyan Research, Technical Training and Technology  Minister Zachary Onyonka.
Before the second round talks opened here after a three-day delay on  Thursday, the Sudanese government, the rebels and the United Nations signed an  agreement here under which relief convoys would be allowed to into the  country's war-torn south, where fighting has continued despite the onset of  the rainy season which turns much of the vast, undevelopped south into swamp  and marsh.
The SPLA took up arms in 1983 in a bid to end domination of the mainly  Christian and animist southern Sudan by the Arabised Moslem north.
