The French manufacturer Roussel Uclaf has  agreed to give patent rights to its abortion drug RU486 to the Population  Council, which will begin trials in the United States later this year, US  officials said Monday.
The council, a non-profit corporation, will test the drug on 2,000  American women at more than 12 sites around the country, said Representative  Ron Wyden.
"American women who waited far too long for this drug will now see the  days of stalling and foot dragging are over," Wyden said.
The Republican administrations of presidents George Bush and Ronald Reagan  opposed US testing of the drug, which has been crititicized by opponents as an  incentive to abortion and as potentially unsafe.
The Food and Drug Administration agreed to expedite review of the drug  tests, relying in part on data from RU486s use in 150,000 European women.
"FDA's decision will be based solely on the scientific and medical  evidence about the safety and efficacy of the product," said Health and Human  Services Secretary Donna Shalala.
She recalled, however, that President Bill Clinton issued a memo directing  HHS to push for the testing and licensing of the drug in the United States.
