Belgian vice-premier and telecommunications  minister Elio di Rupo denounced Monday the presence of his neo-fascist Italian  counterpart, Giuseppe Tatarella, at a European Union ministerial meeting.
"For the first time since the creation of the European Community, the  council has a member from a political party that claims to be the heir of a  form of totalitarianism -- Italy's fascist regime of the 30s and early 40s,"  di Rupo said in a communique.
"This reality is too important to be played down."
He added that his political beliefs and conscience prompted him to deplore  Tatarella's presence at the EU's telecommunications ministers' meeting.
Tatarella is a member of Italy's neo-fascist National Alliance, part of  the ruling coalition there.
He told reporters Monday that his party had broken with fascism and was  "constructive and democratic," and offered to meet with di Rupo to clear up  the matter.
Di Rupo responded that his attitude would change only when Tatarella's  party changed its politics.
Another Italian neo-fascist minister, Adriana Poli Bortone, is to attend  later Monday a meeting of the EU's agriculture ministers.
