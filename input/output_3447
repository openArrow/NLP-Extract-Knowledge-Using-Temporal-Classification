Japan's Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. said  Tuesday its earnings would remain flat this year after group pre-tax profit  rose 0.5 percent to 70 billion yen (680 million dollars) in the year to March.
The leading drugmaker said consolidated sales grew 3.1 percent from a year  earlier to 369 billion yen, supported by brisk sales of hormones and drugs for  stomach ulcers, circulatory diseases and cerebral hemorrhages.
Yamanouchi, which has a tie-up with Eli Lilly in the United States,  forecast flat earnings of 70.5 billion yen this year on higher sales of 380  billion yen.
"We expect business conditions to be more severe in the current year, with  competition intensifying as the medical business changes," a statement said.
Yamanouchi said parent company earnings, which dropped 4.8 percent to 54.4  billion yen in the latest the year, were also projected to remain flat at 54.5  billion yen. Parent company sales, which grew 6.6 percent to 260 billion yen,  were forecast to rise modestly to around 265 billion yen.
Sales during the year were buoyed by increased revenue from digestive  agents, hormones, urinary and reproductive agents, dermatological and blood  products and diagnostics, the company said.
But sales of nervous and sensory agents, circulatory and respiratory  agents, antibiotics and biological and metabolic agents fell.
