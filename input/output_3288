Indiana's upstart Pacers have risen  from mediocrity to become serious challengers for the National Basketball  Association title.
The Pacers have reached the NBA playoff semi-finals against New York,  having rejuvenated a club that has never before won a playoff series and  struggled to avoid losing records the past four years.
"It's hard to even describe the feeling," Indiana guard Reggie Miller  said. "When you have been on the bottom, you can appreciate being on top. It's  the best feeling in the world because it has been so long in coming."
Indiana set a club record with 47 victories under new coach Larry Brown,  known as a master at turning bad teams into good ones.
"If you want to call us over-achievers, well, we are," Indiana general  manager Donnie Walsh said.
The Pacers and Knicks begin their best-of-seven NBA semi-final series  Tuesday, a rematch of last year's first round series won by New York. Houston  and Utah meet in the other semi-final matchup. A physical style of play is  expected from all four clubs.
"If it gets physical and tough, we're just going to have to play  basketball," Brown said. "I don't get caught up in what other teams do. But I  respect them."
New York's John Starks headbutted Miller in last year's playoffs, starting  bad feelings between the clubs.
"I wanted the Knicks," Miller said. "I don't want to duck anyone. Hey,  it's nice we're here. But it's not over for us. We've got a lot of fighting  left in us."
Indiana advanced after ousting Eastern top seed Atlanta four games to two.  The fifth-seeded Pacers swept Orlando in the first round.
"Our chances are as good as anybody's," forward Derrick McKey said. "The  way we're playing, we could beat anybody and we seem to be getting better. We  have some shakey games but we bounce back and that makes a difference."
