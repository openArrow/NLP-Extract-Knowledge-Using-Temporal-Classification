Boris Becker and Pete Sampras face an Italian Open  final showdown after surprising their critics with clay-court successes here  on Saturday.
The duo, who have claimed just one title on the surface between them, both  eased through their semi-finals in straight sets.
But the German triple Wimbledon champion was forced to work harder,  winning a second-set tie-break before seeing off Ivan Ivanisevic 6-2, 7-6  (7/5).
Sampras, whose only success on the surface came in Kitzbuehel in Austria  in 1992, crushed Czech outsider Slava Dosedel in just over an hour.
He beat Jim Courier's conqueror 6-1, 6-2. Sampras currently boastssix  titles from eight events on the ATP tour this year.
Both players will see the final as ideal preparation for the French Open  in just over a week.
The American world number one said: "This final is a big match for both of  us. I know that we'll both be ready to play."
Becker, however, was less upbeat about his chances. "I'm going in  expecting the worst but hoping for the best," he said. "The five-set format  will be better for me, it could allow me to work my way into the match, but  Pete is obviously the one to beat."
