Prices on the London Metals Exchange (LME) closed  lower across the board on Thursday, suffering profit-taking as the market  appeared generally overbought, dealers said.
"There was a bit of position liquidation on all the metals, but over all  this is to be expected on the run-ups we've had recently. It's all very  orderly though, there's no panic yet and you have to expect some profit-taking  to relieve the overbought situation," one trader said.
Copper closed down 33 dollars at 2,247 dollars per tonne.
Dealers said that concern about earthquake damage at Freeport Indonesia's  Grasberg copper mine had helped push the metal up on Wednesday, but the  company quickly scotched fears of any damage.
Nickel fell 17.5 dollars to 1,351 dollars per tonne in nervous trading  ahead of a possible strike next week at the Sudbury, Ontario, operations plant  of the Canadian producer Inco, where the current labor contract expires on the  31st.
Inco remains confident that it will reach a labour agreement by Tuesday or  so, but a union spokesman said that talks were going badly and that a strike  from midnight on May 31st was "almost guaranteed".
But news that the company is being slated as a potential take-over target  will not help the unions cause -- a new boss could apply even more swinging  cuts.
Lead closed down 5.5 dollars at 496.5 dollars per tonne, while zinc was  6.5 dollars lower at 971.5 dollars per tonne.
Aluminium dipped 6.5 dollars to 1,351 dollars per tonne, while tin was 35  dollars lower at 5,600 dollars per tonne.
