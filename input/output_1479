She can book the biggest suite in the grandest hotel  in the world, but that isn't Steffi Graf's idea of paradise.
The girl who probably has more money than she knows what to do with does  not like to surround herself with the trappings of luxury. And she revealed  this week that she has spent some of her most enjoyable times away from tennis  with the poor people of the Dominican Republic.
With so many demands on her time and rarely able to relax, Graf has found  the basic amenities and laid-back attitude of the people there a welcome  contrast to her own pampered but hectic lifestyle.
"It's the best time I've had away from tennis, because it's very pure. The  people are very simple, and they have nothing like televisions there. It's  just a very simple life. It was a nice experience", she said.
"There were very few houses and no hotel. I just stayed in a very plain  and basic room. There was nothing inside, except the bed and the sink. There  wasn't even a toilet."
"We'd go to the beach, and the kids would come up to us and they were  really very friendly.
"One day I went with my brother on a bicycle on the sand and had a little  accident and scratched my leg. Someone came right away and tried to help. Even  if they didn't understand your language, they were so friendly.
"They were living on the beach and didn't have anything much -- just  something to cook on and a few odds and ends. They were really nice people,  and when I went back the next time I took all my old clothes and gave them  away.
"I think it's great the way they live, because they don't have the  pressure of having to do anything in particular. It makes you feel how  unnecessary some of things are that you do sometimes."
Graf fell so much in love with the way of life she would gladly return and  "go native" -- even if only for a short time.
"That would be beautiful... a dream... just sleeping outside," she said,  adding: "Having a very plain life for a week would be wonderful."
