China and the United States have agreed a  formula to resolve the problem of US complaints of jamming of Voice of America  radio broadcasts, a State Department spokesman said Thursday.
The announcement of clear progress in an area targeted by President Bill  Clinton a year ago came as Clinton was preparing to announce whether China had  made sufficient progress on human rights to warrant renewal of its most  favored nation (MFN) trading status.
"If the result of this agreement is unimpeded broadcasts by VOA that  doesn't result in frequency interruption, that would certainly be a step  forward in bringing Voice of America broadcasts to the people of China, and  that would constitute progress," State Department spokesman Michael McCurry  said.
China had long denied US complaints that it was jamming VOA broadcasts  into China, but eased its position somewhat earlier this year by agreeing to  allow a US team to visit to discuss possible technical problems.
As a result of the visit which ended Thursday, the two sides had  determined that VOA and a domestic station were broadcasting on the same  station, and agreed to move VOA to another frequency which was not being used  by anyone else, McCurry said.
"So there should be non-interfered broadcasts" in the future, McCurry said.
But he refused to comment on whether the two sides had established that  jamming was taking place, saying simply that "the problem that the two sides  agreed to address was a problem of entangled frequencies."
McCurry said that no date had been set for putting VOA on a clear  frequency, and that more talks would be held to finalize technical details.
