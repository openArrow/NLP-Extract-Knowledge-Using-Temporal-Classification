Martina Navratilova's final appearance at the French  Open ended in disaster on Monday.
The 37-year-old Czech-born American, who won the title in 1982 and 1984,  crashed at the first hurdle and in straight-sets to 54th-ranked Miriam Oremans  of the Netherlands.
She was never able to adapt her aggressive serve-and-volley tennis to the  deadly slow red clay surface at Roland Garros' number-one show court. And the  fourth-ranked Navratilova was so angry after her defeat that she  uncharacteristically smashed her racket against the backdrop by the changeover.
Navratilova, who had high hopes of a successful run at the Championships  after reaching the Italian Open final earlier this month, was making her  twelfth appearance at the event.
For the last six years, the former world number-one had given the French  Championships a miss in order to concentrate on Wimbledon.
Earlier this year she had a happier time in France when she won the Paris  Indoor Open - her 167th tournament career victory.
Oremans looked as though she might crack when she squandered a 2-0 lead in  the second-set to go 2-4 behind. But the 21-year-old Dutch player fought back  superbly.
Navratilova had been seeded to play defending champion Steffi Graf in the  semi-finals.
