Israeli Prime Minister Izthak Rabin is calling for  Europeans to underpin the Midle East peace process by strengthening economic  cooperation between Israel and the European Union.
In an interview released Sunday in advance of publication Monday in  Germany's Die Welt, Rabin said Israel was not asking for favours or European  aid but wanted a European market which was open to trade with the Jewish state.
Rabin stressed Israel was not asking for EU membership but said: "we  cannot tolerate the discrimination of the European Union." He said the arrival  of peace in the Middle East ought to bring "economic advantages" to Israel,  pointing out that his country posted a 4.5 billion-dollar deficit with EU  states last year.
Rabin asked EU members to remove what his government sees as unfair  competition legislation and afford Israeli products fair access to EU markets,  saying this already happened it the case of the United States.
Rabin said each billion dollars' worth of exports meant the creation of  some 15-20,000 jobs in Israel.
On the question of the Golan Heights, occupied by Israel since 1967 and  annexed in 1981, Rabin said he was willing to put the issue of withdrawal to  the Israeli people in a referendum but only once a "valid accord with Syria  has been negotiated." Syria is demanding the heights be returned before it  will consider a peace agreement with Israel.
