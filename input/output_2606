The US government ran a 17.5 billion dollar  surplus for April, up from 8.1 billion dollars for the same month last year,  the US Treasury Department said Friday.
Despite the expected surplus for the month, the administration predicts a  deficit of 235 billion dollars for the fiscal year that ends September 30.
Receipts for April totalled 141.3 billion dollars while expenditures were  123.9 billion. Interest on the federal debt was 18.3 billion for April and  163.2 billion since the 1994 fiscal year began on October 1.
Customs duties collected by the Treasury dropped by 266 million dollars in  April from 1.5 billion dollars collected in March, hinting at a slowing of US  imports.
