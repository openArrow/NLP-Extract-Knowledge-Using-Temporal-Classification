Libya rejects the secession by southern Yemen and  will oppose any plans to send UN troops to keep the warring sides apart, a  parliamentary leader said here Tuesday.
"There exists only one state in Yemen, the republic of Yemen (which merged  north and south in 1990) and nobody has the right to interfere in its internal  affairs," parliament's foreign affairs secretary, Saad Mujber, told AFP.
"Libya supports Yemen's unity and is opposed to any secession," he said.
Southern leader Ali Salem al-Baid proclaimed an independent state with  Aden as its capital on May 21, two weeks after civil war broke out. His  northern rival, President Ali Abdallah Saleh, has vowed to crush the  "rebellion."
Libyan officials had earlier stopped short of denouncing the secession,  issuing statements of support for Yemen's unity.
Mujber also warned against any "plan to send troops" from the United  Nations to keep the warring sides apart, adding that will "repeat the  catastrophes which took place in ex-Yugoslavia and Somalia."
The Security Council is due to debate the Yemeni conflict on Tuesday.
