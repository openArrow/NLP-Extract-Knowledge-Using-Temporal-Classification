The dollar closed higher at 104.47 yen on the Tokyo  foreign exhange market Tuesday, up 0.17 yen from the previous day's 104.30 yen.
Investors sold yen for dollars on reports Japan and the United States were  set to resume "framework" trade talks suspended since February, dealers said.
The talks, aimed at cutting Japan's chronic huge trade surplus with the  United States, were deadlocked in February when then Japanese prime minister  Morihiro Hosokawa rejected US demands to set numerical targets.
Hosokawa told US President Bill Clinton such targets would undermine the  free trade system and lead to managed trade.
The collapse of the Hosokawa-Clinton talks has led to speculation of US  pressure to bring the exchange rate of the yen higher to help cut the deficit.
After opening at 104.56 yen, the greenback moved between 104.20 yen and  104.60 yen on the Tokyo market Tuesday.
The closing rate here was higher than 104.35 yen quoted in New York in  late trading overnight.
Spot turnover increased from the previous day's 4.786 billion dollars to  5.838 billion dollars.
The mark closed at 1.6468 to the dollar here Tuesday, against 1.6462 the  previous day.
