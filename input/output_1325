Rwandan rebels on Tuesday dismissed accusations by  the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) that they had massacred and  tortured civilians as "ignoble."
"This is propaganda, intended to minimise the genocide being committed in  Rwanda," said James Rwego, spokesman for the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front in  Brussels.
UNHCR spokesman Rupert Colville said earlier that a UNHCR field officer  had seen rebel guerrillas at the Rwanda-Tanzania border shooting civilians  trying to cross the Akagera river to seek sanctuary in Tanzania.
Rwego, however, renewed the rebels' accusations that militias from the  majority Hutu tribe and government soldiers had slaughtered the minority  Tutsis who dominate the rebel movement and Hutu opposition supporters.
"Now they're trying to say that we're doing the same thing, but no neutral  witnesses have reported these abuses," Rwego told AFP.
According to Rwego, eyewitness accounts gathered by UNHCR officials in  refugee camps in neighbouring countries, particularly Tanzania, were obtained  from "militiamen and deserters, who of course accuse the RPF."
UNHCR reported that rebel guerrillas had also "hacked into pieces"  villagers assembled in schools, and had thrown people into the Akagera river  with their hands and feet bound.
An army spokesman also accused the rebels of committing "genocide" against  Hutus in territory under their control.
The rebels now hold two-thirds of Rwanda, according to UN military sources.
About 300,000 Rwandans have fled into Tanzania where they have sought  refuge in the sprawling Benako refugee camp, near Ngara.
More than 200,000 Rwandans have been butchered in six weeks of ethnic  carnage unleashed by the death of president Juvenal Habyarimana in an alleged  April 6 rocket attack on his plane.
