Ten countries have come out firmly in favor of the sanctuary: Argentina,  Australia, Britain, Denmark, France, Ireland, Mexico, Monaco, United States  and New Zealand.
The British-based International Whaling Commission, founded in 1946 to  regulate whale hunting, continues to re-evaluate measures adopted to protect  threatened whale species and monitor populations.
The sanctuary is designed to protect the 1,000 remaining blue whales,  which grow to 30 meters (100 feet) and can weigh 150 tonnes. Another species  which would be affected is the humpback. About 12,000 humpback whales remain.
While most whale species have been devastated by centuries of hunting for  their blubber, used as fuel, and their meat, the minke remains abundant and  has become a target of Japanese and Norwegian whale hunters.
Environmentalists hope that giving the giant mammals some sanctuary will  mean that numbers will grow, no mean feat considering that whales have a  gestation period estimated at eight to 13 months and take a long time to reach  adulthood.
In the past century, more than 1.5 million whales were harvested from the  southern hemisphere. The blue whale population, for example, has been reduced  by 99 percent.
In addition to commercial hunting, the whale is threatened by climatic  changes such as the destruction of the ozone layer protecting Earth from the  sun's ultraviolet rays.
