In the next round, Ritter will face the tournament's most impressive  player so far -- twelfth-seed Mary Pierce.
The 19-year-old French hope brought her all-action show back to the  centre-court and charged into the last-eight in just 63 minutes.
Her latest victim, South Africa's 18th-ranked Amanda Coetzer, was allowed  only two games as Pierce moved just one hurdle away from a probable semi-final  showdown with title-holder Steffi Graf.
"I don't think I can play any better than that," admitted Pierce, who has  now dropped only four games in as many matches since the tournament began.
Coetzer, recent winner at Prague and responsable for putting sixth-seed  Kimiko Date out of the tournament in the first-round, certainly didn't play  badly. The 22-year-old from Hoopstad fought all the way, ran down a lot of  balls others might have left as winners and kept her own groundshots sharp and  deep.
But Pierce was seeing the ball like a football.
In fact the French player was so eager to play, she often came close to  hitting balls back which were clearly going to be out.
The Canadian-born teenager has been transformed into a relaxed, smiling  and confident professional since coming under the wing of Nick Bollettieri  late last year.
Just twelve months ago she was beaten in the fourth-round here by American  Jennifer Capriati in a tournament marred by off court drama and incidents --  her father Jim being escorted out of the stadium for rowdy behaviour and  subsequently banned from attending all women's events.
