Military aid to African countries should be  phased out and development assistance boosted to help end violence on the  continent, a UN official said Tuesday.
James Speth, administrator of the UN Development Program, said military  assistance should be phased out over the next three years, starting with  countries at war or at risk of conflict, such as Zaire, Burundi, Cameroon,  Nigeria and Algeria.
"Already one-third, or 16 African countries are involved in some form of  civil conflcit," Speth told the African-American Institute in New York. "There  are over six million refugees outside their borders, with another 17 million  internally displaced.
"There is simply no way that development can proceed under these  conditions. For the poor countries in Africa, the poor people in Africa, this  madness should be brought to an end."
Speth proposed that 400 million dolllars, or 10 percent of the four  billion dollars in military spending annually be applied to a peace fund to be  operated by the Organization of African Unity. The UNDP would contribute three  million dollars to the fund.
In remarks released by the UN, the official also called for substantial  debt relief for Africa and full funding of a 30 billion dollar development  program for the continent.
