"All the members of the family love her very deeply. We wanted to be here  this evening. She's resting comfortably," he said Wednesday.
Visitors to the canopied apartment building on Fifth Avenue included her  sister, Lee Radzill Ross, and their half-brother Jamie Auchincloss.
Congressman Kennedy, son of the late Robert Kennedy, arrived with flowers  and candy. Onassis' niece Maria Shriver also was reported to have visited.
An intensely private woman, Onassis has shunned the role of American icon  since her husband's assassination in Dallas in 1963 and her stormy second  marriage to Onassis.
The image of her most remembered is also the most painful: the young wife  leaning over her husband's slumped body seconds after an assassin's bullet  struck their open limousine in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963.
A figure of glamour and sophistication, Onassis became the center of  controversy at home when she wed a second time to a Greek tycoon in what many  said was a marriage for money.
A highly publicized legal battle with his heirs ensued when Onassis died  in 1975, leaving his wife virtually nothing.
Long the prey of paparazzis and tabloids, who dubbed her "Jackie O,"  Onassis has fought fiercely over the years to protect her family's privacy.
But, out of the limelight, she has made a career as a book editor, first  at Viking Press and then Doubleday, handling a dozen books a year on  non-fiction subjects such as ballet and the performing arts.
Even since being diagnosed with cancer earlier this year, she has worked  three days a week at her office, taking work home with her.
