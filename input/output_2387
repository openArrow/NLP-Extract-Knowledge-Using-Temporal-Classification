The United States has refused a visa to Thai  opposition MP Mongkol Chongsuthamanee because of suspicion he was involved in  drug trafficking, the US Embassy said Friday.
A US Embassy statement noted that, while Mongkol had never been charged in  Thailand or the United States, US law did not require a visa applicant to have  been charged or convicted of a narcotics offense to be ineligible for a visa.
"A well-founded reason to believe that the applicant is knowingly involved  in the illicit narcotics trade is sufficient," the statement said.
In parliament Thursday, Mongkol, a Chart Pattana party MP, emotionally  denied allegations he was involved in drug trafficking during a debate in  which government and opposition MPs traded charges.
The US Embassy said Mongkol was denied a visa on March 18, 1994, and was  advised in writing of the reason.
The statement, issued in response to media queries, said that a visa  issued to Mongkol in 1991, "before information regarding his ineligibility  came to the attention of the Department of State," was no longer valid.
The embassy refused to say whether information on the suspicions against  Mongkol had been made available to the Thai government.
Earlier this month, a California court disclosed a November 1991  indictment of opposition MP Thanong Siripreechapong, of the Chart Thai party,  on charges of trafficking in more than 45 tons of marijuana over a 14-year  period from 1973.
