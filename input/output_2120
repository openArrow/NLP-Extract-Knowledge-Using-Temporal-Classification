The dollar was mixed in calm trading here  Thursday afternoon, but dealers expected it to strengthen against the yen in  response to US-Japan trade talks.
The ounce of gold rose 1.30 dollars to 383.30 dollars from Wednesday's  close.
Around 1 p.m. (1700 GMT), the dollar was trading at 1.6555 German marks  against 1.6560 at the start of the day and at 1.6570 Wednesday.
The dollar traded at 104.23 yen, up from 104 at the open and 103.45 from  Wednesday's close.
The dollar was mixed against other major European currencies, trading at  5.6630 French francs against 5.6710 Wednesday, at 1.4105 Swiss francs against  1.4085, and at 0.6631 pounds sterling against 0.6629.
The opening of talks on resuming trade negotiations between the United  States and Japan was viewed with optimism in the foreign exchange markets, a  dealer with a major European bank in New York said.
"They believe that the Japanese are committed to do something this time  even though it probably won't be much," he said.
The trade talks collapsed in February over a dispute over how to measure  progress in opening Japan's markets and reducing its 60-billion dollar trade  surplus with the United States.
