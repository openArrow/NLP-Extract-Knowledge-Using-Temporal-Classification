An historic documentation centre established in  memory of Andrei Sakharov was inaugurated Saturday, the 73rd anniversary of  the late Nobel peace prize laureate's birth, press reports said here.
The Andrei Sakharov archives contain several thousand manuscripts,  scientific papers, books and family documents, some dating back to the 18th  century, said Yelena Bonner, the widow of the celebrated dissident, academic  and scientist who died in 1989.
Speaking at a conference to mark the opening, Bonner described the archive  as "a monument to the memory of this astonishing man who was ahead of his time  and who up to the end of his life was understood by no one," the ITAR-TASS  agency said.
At the conference Bonner was also handed documents on her late husband's  activities from the presidential archives and those of the KGB, the former  Soviet secret police.
The intelligence reports included 62 drafted by the KGB from 1968 until  six days before Sakharov's death, which were handed over personally by Sergei  Stepashin, the head of Russia's counter-espionage service.
In all, the KGB investigation into Sakharov's human rights activities  alone ran to 520 volumes.
"This is a true Guinness world record," said Stepashin. "No other  individual was subject to the same level of attention."
The personal diaries of Sakharov, who was awarded the Nobel prize in 1975,  were destroyed by the KGB, Stepashin added.
A Sakharov museum already exists in the apartment he and his wife shared  in Gorky -- now renamed Nijni Novgorod -- east of Moscow during their enforced  exile, which lasted more than 10 years. The couple were allowed to return to  Moscow in 1986.
