The Senate defied President Bill Clinton on  Thursday by approving a measure that would require the United States to  unilaterally lift the arms embargo against Bosnia.
The plan proposed by Senate Republican leader Bob Dole would force the US  administration to disregard the 1991 UN embargo and clear the way for US arms  shipments to help the Bosnian government defend itself in the two-year-old war.
Although the amendment, approved 50 to 49, has little chance of becoming  law, it undercut Clinton a day ahead of international talks in Geneva on  resolving the conflict.
Clinton has pressed for a multilateral lifting of the embargo but has  maintained that a unilateral effort by Washington could undermine other UN  actions around the world.
"The president really understands the Senate sentiment here," said White  House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers. "He has opposed the arm embargo in Bosnia  from the beginning. We've pursued other options and as a result we've made  some progress on the ground in Bosnia."
But Myers said a unilateral lifting of the embargo could encourage other  countries to ignore UN sanctions on Serbia, North Korea and other nations.
The measure goes to the House of Representatives, where it was expected to  have little chance of passage. But even if it were approved, Clinton could  veto the measure, and a two-thirds majority of both houses would be needed to  override the veto.
Earlier, senators passed by an identical 50-49 margin an amendment  sponsored by Mitchell calling on Clinton to seek a consensus among US allies  to lift the embargo. By placing the two amendments in the same bill, senators  appeared to give contradictory directives to the president.
