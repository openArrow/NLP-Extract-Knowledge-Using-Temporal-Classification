The Tonton Macoutes, the dreaded militia  that terrorized Haitians under two dictators, re-emerged Friday and pledged to  lead the resistance in case of a US invasion of the impoverished Caribbean  country.
The Macoutes, whose name became synonymous with savagery under the regimes  of Francois "Papa Doc" Duvalier and his son, Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier,  pleged to re-organize to protect against a foreign invasion.
At its height, the militia formally known as the National Security  Volunteer Corps included some 300,000 members before the group was dissolved  in February 1986 by the military government after Baby Doc Duvalier was ousted.
At a news conference at the headquarters of the pro-Duvalier Rally of  Democrats for the Republic Party on Friday, one former Macoute said 30,000  former members were prepared to join the call to arms and would begin wearing  their blue denim uniforms in coming days.
The Macoutes would fight alongside the army in case of a US invasion, a  matter being discussed in Washington as an option to restore Jean-Bertrand  Aristide, the democratically elected president ousted in a September 1991 coup.
Since Aristide's ouster, pro-Duvalier forces have become more active, some  seeking the return of the Jean-Claude Duvalier, who has been living in exile  in France.
