Portugal protested Tuesday to the Philippines over  its handling of an international conference on alleged Indonesian abuses in  the former Portuguese colony of East Timor, the Portuguese foreign ministry  said.
Portugal's UN representative protested to his Filipino counterpart against  Manila's refusal to allow foreign nationals into the Philippines to take part  in the conference and its ejection of Portuguese citizens already in the  country, the ministry said.
The Manila Supreme Court on Tuesday temporarily lifted a lower court order  barring the private conference, due to last until Friday.
The ban had been obtained by allies of President Fidel Ramos, who had said  the conference would cause "irreparable harm" to relations with Indonesia.
Manila's actions, banning non-Filipino's entry into the country,  "contradict the good relations existing between the two countries" the  Portuguese complained.
They noted "the responsibilities of the Filipino authorities for the  security of Portuguese nationals on its territory," the foreign ministry added.
Among 27 foreign nationals due to appear at the conference, 10 were to be  expelled from the country. Another 12, including Irish Nobel peace prize  winner Mairead Maguire, were turned back on their arrival at Manila airport.
Indonesia has put strong pressure on Manila to ban the conference,  cancelling a ministerial visit, pulling out of a regional business conference  in the southern Philippines and threatening to end its efforts to act as  go-between in peace talks between Manila and Moslem guerrillas.
A former Portuguese colony, East Timor was invaded by Indonesia in  December 1975 and annexed in 1976. Human rights groups claim that tens of  thousands of people have died in the subsequent repression.
The United Nations does not recognize Jakarta's sovereignty over East  Timor.
