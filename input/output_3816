A top level Norwegian foreign ministry advisor on the  Middle East was asked to become UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's  deputy, the foreign ministry said here Wednesday.
Foreign ministry spokesman Ingvar Havnen said Boutros-Ghali requested  Monday that Terje Roed Larsen become his deputy on Middle Eastern issues.
"Mr. Boutros-Ghali contacted us last night about this offer and the  Norwegian government expresses its support for Larsen's candidacy," Havnen  said.
Larsen, 47, has accepted the offer, the Norwegian new agency NTB reported  from Washington.
He was scheduled to meet Wednesday with officials at UN headquarters in  New York, Havnen said.
"We see this as a recognition of the Norwegian government's role in the  peace process in the Middle East," he added.
Larsen is head of the Oslo-based Institute of Applied Social Sciences,  which was instrumental in setting up the first secret meetings between Israeli  and the PLO in Norway in 1993.
The meetings led to the accord signed September, 13, 1993, granting  Palestinians limited autonomy in the occupied territories.
Larsen, a sociologist, was advisor on Middle East issues to the late  foreign minister Johan Joergen, one of the architects of the accord.
He is currently advisor to Larsen's successor, Bjoern Tore Godal.
