The coach is, however, counting on striker Hwang Sung-hong, who was also  in Italy. The 25-year-old forward proved his sharpness in recent friendlies.  "The success of our team depends on Hwang," Kim said.
Goalkeeper Choi In-young and midfielders Hong Myung-bo, skipper Gu  Sang-bum and Lee Young-jin are also veterans of the last World Cup.
Another midfielder Noh Jung yoon, who is the only Korean in Japan's J  League where he plays with Sanfrecce Hiroshima, was an outstanding performer  in the qualifying competition although there are doubts about his stamina.
He rarely lasted whole matches in the heat and humidity of the Asian  finals.
Park Jung bae is the side's solid defensive leader.
