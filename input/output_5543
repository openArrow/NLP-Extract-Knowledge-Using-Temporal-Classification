Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati arrived  here Monday for a Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) conference, becoming the most  senior official from Iran to visit Egypt since 1979.
Velayati declined to comment to reporters on his arrival in Cairo, on the  eve of the four-day meeting of NAM foreign ministers. "Next time," he said.
The foreign minister is the highest-ranking Iranian official to visit  since the two countries broke off relations in 1979 after Egypt signed a peace  treaty with Israel and granted asylum to Iran's deposed shah.
In Tehran, a foreign ministry spokesman said last week that Velayati would  not meet any Egyptian officials and his visit to Cairo was solely for the NAM  conference.
According to an Egyptian diplomatic source, Iran could be a candidate to  take over the chairmanship of NAM when Indonesia's term runs out in September  1995.
