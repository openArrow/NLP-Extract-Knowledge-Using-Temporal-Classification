The Palestinian police want to  regulate the possession of arms in the Gaza Strip, police chief General Nasr  Yussef said Wednesday.
"We want to regulate the possession of firearms, register them and have  the identities of gun-owners," Yussef told a press conference. "We hope these  arms will be used to support us."
He predicted the new force would not have trouble with the armed wing of  the Islamic Resistance Movement HAMAS which has vowed to fight on against  Israeli occupation.
"This movement supports the interests of the Palestinian people and will  continue to do so. I don't think there will be any problems with it."
Yussef went on: "We can say that Gaza is on the road to liberation, now  that the Israelis recognize that this land is Palestinian and belongs to the  people. So they know their presence is illegal."
"After the interim period the settlers and the army will leave this  region."
The Israeli army remains in three areas on the Gaza Strip to protect 4,000  Jewish settlers for five years in line with the Palestinian autonomy  agreement.    Israel and the Palestinians are due begin negotiations on the  final status of the occupied territories after two years of autonomy.
Yussef said he had began to make security preparations for the arrival of  PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, who is expected on June 5, according to PLO  negotiator Nabil Shaath.
