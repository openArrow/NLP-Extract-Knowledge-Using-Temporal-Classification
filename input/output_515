Moscow is to propose its own accord with NATO  extending beyond the Atlantic alliance's Partnership for Peace programme to  reflect Russia's status, Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev indicated Saturday.
The NATO partnership programme, which offers former Warsaw Pact countries  closer military cooperation but stops short of giving them full alliance  membership, was "very abstract and provisional" and "not altogether  sufficient" for Russia's needs, said Kozyrev, cited by the Interfax news  agency.
Moscow's tailor-made accord with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation  would centre on the conversion of arms production to civilian usage,  peacekeeping operations and military cooperation, Kozyrev told Russian  journalists in Geneva.
He said any partnership should include provision for joint military  manoeuvres and political consultations, as is currently the case over Bosnia.
Meanwhile Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said he would use a meeting with  his NATO counterparts in Brussels on May 24 outline Russia's requirements for  a partnership accord.
Early in 1993 Russia indicated it would join the NATO partnership.
But Moscow's membership of the partnership programme, which a clutch of  eastern European countries have already joined, recently ran into snags after  NATO carried out air strikes in Bosnia last month without consulting Moscow.
