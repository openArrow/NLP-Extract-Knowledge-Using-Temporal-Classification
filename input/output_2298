North Korea has begun extracting fuel rods from its  Yongbyon reactor in a "serious violation" of International Atomic Energy  Agency inspection terms that will be reported to the UN Security Council, the  IAEA said late Thursday.
The removal of the rods, if not halted immediately, could wreck the IAEA's  attempts to see if fuel had already been taken from the reactor, the IAEA said  in a strong statement.
Washington wants the IAEA to check whether North Korea has been hiving off  weapons-grade plutonium to make a nuclear bomb.
But the IAEA said: "As of today, it still seems possible to implement the  required safety measures."
But it warned: "Should (North Korea) continue the discharge operation  without these measures, it would result in irreparable loss of the Agency's  ability to verify whether all nuclear material subject to safeguards in (North  Korea) is in fact under safeguards and that no such material has been  diverted."
The IAEA said it had sent a telex to North Korea on Thursday to complain  that the discharge of fuel rods "constitutes a serious violation of the  safeguards agreement" for monitoring nuclear facilities.
The statement said IAEA inspectors on site had "confirmed that core  discharge has indeed started."
"The Agency has concluded that further discharge of fuel rods would  jeopardise the possibility of the Agency applying safeguards measures necessry  to verify whether any fuel has been diverted in the past."
The statement said the IAEA would report the violation to the United  Nations Security Council.
"The Agency has asked (North Korea) to make arrangements promptly for the  requisite safeguards measures and has urged that until these are in place,  further discharge be deferred."
It said it wanted to send an IAEA team to the site immediately to discuss  implementing the checks.
In Washington, President Bill Clinton said this week: "I think it would be  an error for North Korea to continue to thwart these inspections after they  have agreed to comply with them."
US Defense Secretary, William Perry, said Wednesday that the United States  faced "a very substantial near-term crisis" with North Korea.
The fuel rods in the reactor contains enough plutonium for four or five  nuclear bombs, the Pentagon said.
North Korea has denied that it has a nuclear weapons program but has  balked at international inspections.
The Central Intelligence Agency has estimated that North Korea withdrew  enough plutonium in the late 1980s to make at least one nuclear device and  that there is a more than 50 percent chance it actually did so.
North Korea's continued refusal to abide by the IAEA's non-proliferation  rules has led to international threats of UN sanctions, which in turn prompted  war threats from Pyongyang.
North Korean President Kim Il-Sung, in his latest warning, said that North  Korea would not bow to international pressure over its nuclear ambitions,  saying that "pressure can never be a solution to the problem," according to  the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).
"If the United States continues to clamour to put pressure on our  republic, we will be compelled to take due measures of self-defence to  safeguard the dignity of our nation and the sovereignty of our country," added  the leader of the Stalinist state.
