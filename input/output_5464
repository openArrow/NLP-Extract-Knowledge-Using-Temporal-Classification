Hardline ultra-nationalists screaming "devils"  tried to break up a first service at Israel's Holocaust memorial on Monday for  the 200,000 homosexuals murdered by the Nazis.
About 100 Israeli and American homosexuals and lesbians gathered in the  Memorial Hall at Yad Vashem to hear a recital of the Jewish prayer for the  dead or kaddish.
About a dozen hardliners who were in the hall started shouting and threw a  rabbi's prayer book on the floor.
"They are devils," shouted one man who lay on the floor in protest.
"Don't let them desecrate this place. Kill us but we will not let them  desecrate the name of our martyrs."
Another of the protesters, Avigdor Etkni, told journalists: "The Holocaust  is too sacred to let a group of hooligans, who are considered criminals under  Jewish morality, win legitimacy for their cause."
The nationalists were expelled by security guards and the service  continued.
"For the first time we wanted to honour the memory of the 200,000  homosexuals of all religions who were murdered by the Nazis," said Amit Kara,  chairman of the Israeli Association for the Protection of Personal Rights of  Homosexuals, Lesbians and Bisexuals.
"One can live with dignity as a Jew and a homosexual. The memory of  homosexuals deserves to be honoured as well," said Misha Mandel, who recited  the kaddish. "I am proud of what happened today."
The disruption followed an advertisement placed in the Jerusalem Post  newspaper by a group of rabbis called the Bet Din Elyon of America, which  branded the ceremony a "desecration" and demanded it be called off.
The rabbis warned of a worldwide boycott of Yad Vashem.
The memorial authorities replied that it was "open to any individual or  groups who wish to place a wreath in the Hall of Memory to honour their loved  ones".
