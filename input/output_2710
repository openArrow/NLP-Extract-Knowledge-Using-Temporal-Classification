The US is to reopen high-level talks with North  Korea after administration officials decided the North has met key demands for  international nuclear inspections, according to news reports here Saturday.
The decision was taken a a meeting of senior officials at the White House  late Friday said the New York Times.
Earlier Friday US Defense Secretary William Perry announced North Korea  had not diverted fuel from a nuclear reactor at Yongbyon nuclear complex.
Perry said the Koreans had allowed inspectors from the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to check that no such transfers had taken place.
One US official said that about five percent of the 8,000 fuel rods had  been removed and placed in a special pond that the IAEA was allowed to monitor.
According to the Pentagon the fuel rods in the Yongbyon reactor contains  enough plutonium for four or five nuclear bombs.
"The IAEA has told us that it is confident that there has been no  diversion of the fuel that has just been discharged," said Perry.
The US broke off talks with North Korea last July because of Pyongyang  refusal to allow international inspections of their nuclear facilities.
The US has offered to expand diplomatic and economic ties with North Korea  if it agrees to abandon its nuclear weapon programme but the North has  strongly denied such a programme exists.
The Central Intelligence Agency has estimated that North Korea withdrew  enough plutonium in the late 1980s to make at least one nuclear device and  that there is a more than 50 percent chance it actually did so.
North Korea's continued refusal to abide by the IAEA's non-proliferation  rules has led to international threats of UN sanctions, which in turn prompted  war threats from Pyongyang.
