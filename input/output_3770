German automaker Volkswagen is negotiating to set  up a joint venture producing Audi cars in China, adding to two existing  companies manufacturing its Santana and Jetta sedans, the China Daily said  Wednesday.
According to Volkswagen Asia-Pacific Ltd. president Martin Posth, the  company is currently holding talks with the First Automobile Works (FAW) based  in Changchun, capital of northeastern Jilin province.
Posth did not say if the Audi production would be merged with the  operations of a Volkswagen-FAW joint venture set up in 1991 to produce Jetta  sedans.
The newspaper quoted a State Planning Commission official as saying the  government supported the negotiations, but added it had not yet received  specific proposals for the venture.
In late 1993, the government put a freeze on new car manufacturing plants  for the next two to three years. Any agreement between Volkswagen and FAW will  have to wait for inclusion in the country's ninth five-year plan (1996-2000).
Under new state guidelines, only joint ventures that assemble cars with at  least 40 percent domestically-made components in the initial production phase  will be allowed.
Volkswagen's two existing joint ventures assembled 110,000 Santana and  Jetta cars last year, or 45 percent of the total sedan production in China.
