The Vatican has acknowledged for the first time  that the Catholic Church had a role in centuries of persecution of the Jews,  including the World War II Holocaust, according to a document obtained here  Wednesday.
In a draft document yet to be ratified by Pope John Paul II, the Vatican  says: "A terrible mixture of religious, social, economical, political and  racial hostility created the historical basis for the European Jews being  driven on their deadly way toward the Shoah (Holocaust).
And the three-part paper, a copy of which has been obtained by AFP,  acknowledges that the "Church as a whole offered no effective resistance to  the Nazi persecution and extermination."
It has been hailed by Rabbi David Rosen, head of the committee charged  with overseeing relations between Judaism and the Catholic Church, as "an  exceptional and historic document."
"In the text the Church undergoes a deep examination of its conscience and  repents," Rosen told AFP.
The document was presented to a joint Jewish-Catholic committee by  Cardinal Edward Cassidy, president of the papal committee for Christian unity,  meeting for the first time in Jersualem.
It follows after Israel and the Vatican established diplomatic links in  December for the first time since the creation of the Jewish State in 1948.
Cassidy told journalists: "We have reached the stage where we cannot only  treat the problems of the past (..), but we believe that the best way to build  a relationship is to work together.
"We had promised our Jewish friends that we would try to produce a  document from the Catholic side which would speak about the Shoah and condemn  all forms of anti-Semitism," he added.
