A man jailed for belonging to Portugal's  extreme-left FP-25 organisation is near death after 32 days on hunger strike,  a commission backing an amnesty for members of the group said Saturday.
The prisoner is demanding a move to where three other FP-25 members are  being held, as well as better conditions.
Lawmakers in the centre-right Portuguese government refused opposition  demands for an amnesty to coincide with last month's 20th anniversary of the  April 1974 revolution.
