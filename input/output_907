A train carrying more than 400  people from New York to Florida collided with a freight train before dawn  Monday, killing at least two people and injuring 20 others, authorities said.
The collision ocurred about 40 miles north of Fayetteville, North Carolina  at 4:32 a.m., Amtrak spokeswoman Pat Kelly said in Washington.
"There appears to be, from the sketchy information we have, a collision  between the Amtrak train and a freight train, but I do not know the nature of  that collision," said Johnston County Sheriff Clifford Black.
Two people were killd and at least 20 others were injured, according to  Kevin Messengill of the sheriff's department, who said 12 cars went off the  tracks.
A local hospital reported receiving some of the injured.
