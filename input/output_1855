Visiting British royal Prince  Charles, himself a keen farmer, got some mud under his shoes Wednesday on a  visit to a potato field 30 kilometres (18 miles) outside this northwestern  city.
On the second day of his visit, a Russian Zil limousine dropped the prince  off at the region's largest agricultural university, a recipient of British  government aid which is being groomed to become a model of private enterprise  selling its own produce.
Britain's Know How Fund has already provided tractors and seeds for the  university, where some 3,000 students are working what was once a Tsarist farm.
Last year the farm produced 300 tonnes of Scottish "Romano" potatoes,  which the Russians have jokingly renamed "Romanov" after the Tsars.
Officials were pleased with the harvest from the potato field, part of the  2,000 hectare (4,940 acre) mixed farm, which has recently been privatised.
His nose and cheeks reddened by an unexpectedly cold snap, the prince was  offered a large chunk of traditional Russian bread and salt, and exclaimed  "It's exactly what I needed."
