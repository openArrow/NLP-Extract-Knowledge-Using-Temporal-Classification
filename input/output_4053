A plaque honoring the 1,012 people who died in  the 1914 sinking of the Empress of Ireland, Canada's worst maritime disaster,  will be unveiled Sunday.
The plaque is to be placed on the wreckage of the ocean liner, which lies  in 50 meters (160 feet) of water in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, on the 80th  anniversary of the disaster, according to officials at the Maritime Museum at  Point-au-Pere, Quebec.
The liner left Quebec May 28, 1914 bound for Britain and sank a day later  after colliding in dense fog with a Swedish freighter.
A total of 465 people survived after being plucked out of the icy waters  by the Swedish ship and other rescue vessels.
The disaster occurred two years after the sinking of the Titanic.
