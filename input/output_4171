South African police divers were striving  Thursday to rescue 32 forestry workers whose bus toppled into a reservoir,  police said.
Thirty-six other workers managed to escape from the bus after the  accident, which took place in a forest area of southeastern Transvaal, near  Lothair.
It was not immediately known whether those trapped were still alive in the  bus, which came to rest on its roof with its wheels just emerging above the  surface of the water.
