President Ali Abdallah Saleh Saturday rejected his  rival Ali Salem al-Baid's announcement of an independent state in southern  Yemen.
Saleh, speaking on Sanaa Radio, said the proclamation was "unlawful."
Seventeen days into a civil war between northern forces loyal to the  president and the south, Baid, the ousted vice president, announced the  creation of the "Yemeni Democratic Republic as an independent state with its  capital in Aden."
