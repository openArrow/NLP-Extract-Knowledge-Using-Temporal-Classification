The Uruguayan writer Juan Carlos Onetti, one of  Latin America's greatest novelists, died aged 85 of a heart attack in a Madrid  clinic, sources close to his family said.
Onetti fled political persecution in Uruguay in 1975 and had lived in the  Spanish capital ever since.
Ten years ago he decided never to get out of bed and leave his home.
Author of some 50 works, he published a book last March entitled "Cuentos  Completos" (Complete Tales). He was taken to hospital last week after being  ill for several months.
