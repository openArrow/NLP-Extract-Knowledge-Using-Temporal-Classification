Arab officials attending the Non-Aligned Movement  ministerial conference here were to hold talks about the Yemeni civil war on  Tuesday, an Egyptian diplomat said.
Nabil Fahmy, spokesman for this round of NAM meetings, told journalists  that the Arab ministers would meet on the sidelines of the conference late  Tuesday in an attempt to find a solution to the Yemeni crisis.
The meeting comes on the same day the UN Security Council was to discuss  how to broker a ceasefire.
Most Arab countries back the UN attempt to settle the conflict and Saudi  Arabia and Oman have offered ceasefire strategies.
Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Saleh has said the Security Council debate  interferes in Yemen's internal affairs, but his rival, southern leader Ali  Salem al-Baid, has welcomed the UN move.
