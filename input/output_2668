Indonesia was Saturday toasting 14-year-old Mia  Audina as the heroin of a famous victory over defending champions China in the  Uber Cup final.
The teenager, criticised for being too young to make an international  debut, faced Zhang Nin to decide the final with the score level at 2-2.
Mia came back from 7-2 down to win the first game 11-7 but nerves got the  better of her in the second as she lost 12-1- after leading 10-7.
Mia, who will be 15 in August and is already the reigning Netherlands and  German Open champion, went 7-0 ahead in the final leg before winning 11-4.
Indonesia have lost five times to China in previous Uber Cup team  badminton championships.
World champion and Olympic gold medalist Susi Susanti put the Indonesian  women's team on the road to their first Uber title since 1975 and only their  second since the championship started in 1957.
She beat world number two Ye Zhaoying 11-4, 12-10. In the doubles  Indonesian pair Lili Tampi and Finarsih outplayed China's Wu Yuhong and Chen  Ying 15-13, 17-16.
China bounced back through Han Jingna, world number five, who outclassed  Indonesia's Yuliani Santosa 11-5, 11-5.
China's second doubles pair Ge Fei and Gu Jun levelled the final by  beating Indonesia's  Eliza and Zelin Resiana 15-10, 15-8.
