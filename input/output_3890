Fourth-seeded Ukranian Andrei Medvedev dropped a set to former world  junior champion Nicklas Kulti of Sweden but came safely through to the  third-round 6-4, 7-6 (7/4), 4-6, 7-5.
He now plays Canada's Greg Rusedski who chalked up a surprise 7-5, 6-3,  2-6, 6-3 win over Russian Alexander Volkov.
In the women's singles, defending champion and top seed Steffi Graf made  heavy weather of a 7-5, 6-3 win over Dutch opponent Stephanie Rottier.
Afterwards the world number-one admited that she hadn't played well.
"I felt bad out there today. Training in the rain this morning didn't  help. I just didn't feel I was ready for this match. But the main thing is  that I won."
Graf, bidding for her fifth consecutive major title, now faces South  African Joanetta Kruger who defeated Radka Zbrubakova of Slovakia 4-6, 7-5,  6-3.
