Former socialist premier Bettino Craxi has  appealed against a decision by Milan's prosecutor forcing him to surrender his  passport pending corruption charges, his lawyers announced Monday.
Nicolo Amato and Enzo La Giudice issued the appeal to a city court which  is to decide Thursday whether or not to revoke the prosecutor's May 12  decision made to ensure Craxi does not flee the country.
Craxi is currently in Hammamet on the Tunisian coast, where his wife says   he is receiving treatment for diabetes and where the couple have a villa.
The former premier faces several charges of corruption and an  investigation into alleged illegal financing of his Socialist Party (PSI).  Craxi's lawyers had earlier promised their client would give up his passport  in the next few days to prevent an international warrant being issued against  him.
In all, 18 former deputies have been told to hand in their passports to  prevent them going abroad to avoid corruption trials and to ensure they do not  carry out any illegal transactions while facing trial.
On Saturday, Italian television journalists were roughed up by security  guards and detained for several hours after they thought they saw Craxi at the  wheel of a car in the villa's grounds.
His wife Anna said Craxi would "return home from Hammamet before the end  of next week." She told the daily La Stampa last week: "My husband is the  victim of a huge injustice. He is not someone who flees."
