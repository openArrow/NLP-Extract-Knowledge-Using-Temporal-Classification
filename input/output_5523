Mexican rebels concluded  consultations on a provisional agreement to end their uprising but announced  no decision, according to a guerrilla statement released here Monday.
The Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) said its mostly ethnic-Maya  fighters and their supporters "had analyzed, discussed and come to a decision"  on the federal governement's responses to a package of 34 rebel demands,  mainly to improve social and economic conditions in Chiapas, Mexico's poorest  state.
The EZLN had been considering the government offers since March 2.
A week of fighting in early January left about 100 people dead by the  government's tally, and more than 400 according to the local Roman Catholic  church.
The next step will be for the rebel permanent assembly to analyze the  response from assemblies held in indigenous communities, and then issue a  formal response.
Rebel-held areas will be closed to the press while this analysis is taking  place, according to a statement signed by EZLN leader Subcommandante Marcos.
"The men, women, children and elders who in 1993 voted for the beginning  of the war, as well as all of those who have joined Zapatista ranks, have  given the country a lesson in freedom and democracy by exercising their right  to help lead, through their free and direct votes, our EZLN," Marcos said in  the statement.
