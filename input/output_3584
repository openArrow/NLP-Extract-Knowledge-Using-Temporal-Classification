Students in Ivory Coast's three universities began  a new strike on Tuesday to press for the release of 16 of their fellows jailed  in the economic capital Abidjan and at Bouake, in the centre of the country.
The strike call by the officially dissolved student union FESCI was widely  followed at the two universities in Abidjan, where police and paramilitary  police were deployed and all classes were cancelled.
Apart from calling for the "immediate and unconditional release" of their  colleagues, students told AFP they wanted canteens opened and details of  grants released.
Three of their colleagues were jailed in November and one last March, each  for a year following violent protest demonstrations, while the cases of other  detainees are being investigated.
Tuition had resumed in Abidjan only a week ago after a previous strike by  students, who were warned by authorities that the academic year could be  written off. The year began, late, in February and is due to end in August.
About 50,000 students attend classes at the universities of  Abidjan-Cocody, Abidjan-Abobo and Bouake.
