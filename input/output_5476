A delegation of British Labour MPs held talks  here Monday with Vice President Abdel Halim Khaddam on the Middle East peace  process, the official Syrian news agency SANA said.
The MPs, led by Mike Watson, also visited the destroyed town of Kuneitra  on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights, where Watson condemned Israel's  annexation of the bulk of the territory, SANA said.
Watson planted an olive tree in Kuneitra as the party toured the ruins of  the town razed to the ground by Israel before it withdrew following the 1967  Middle East war.
He called for a total Israeli pullout from the strategic heights, the  agency added.
The return of the Golan has been the key stumbling-block in the  Israeli-Syrian track of the Middle East peace process.
The delegation from Britain's opposition Labour Party on Sunday met  parliamentary speaker Abdel Kadder Kaddura for talks on the peace process and  relations between London and Damascus.
They arrived the previous day from Lebanon on a Middle East tour which  will also take them to Jordan, the Israeli-occupied territories and East  Jerusalem.
