A large crowd gathered at the family home in Gaza's up-market Rimal  neighbourhood, but they were disappointed as Sakr did not appear.
He was seen sitting quietly at the back of the house which was protected  by a large number of armed bodyguards.
Gun-wielding Palestinian guerrillas of the Hawks, armed wing of the  mainstream PLO movement Fatah, were also kept away.
"I do not have authority to talk to anyone," Sakr told AFP.
