A military engineer was killed Monday when a bomb  destroyed his car as he drove out of the Spanish capital, police said.
Police blamed the blast, which occured at 8:30 a.m. (0630 GMT), on the  outlawed Basque separatist guerilla movement ETA, although no organisation  immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.
The car was destroyed in the blast, which killed its occupant Miguel  Peralta Utrera, 59, and sparked a huge rush-hour traffic jam.
