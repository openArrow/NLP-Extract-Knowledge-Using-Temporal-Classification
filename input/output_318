England's Philip Don is replacing Holland's  threatened referee John Blankenstein for the European Champions Cup final  between AC Milan and Barcelona on May 18, UEFA said Friday.
Blankenstein has received death threats from Italy, as Barcelona coach  Johan Cruyff and defender Ronald Koeman are also from Holland.
European football's governing body UEFA said in a statement it: "Had  received recently a number of serious death threats from Italy." The statement  further said they were acting for reasons of security and the decision in no  way questioned Blankenstein's refereeing ability.
Vice-President of Barcelona, Jose Mussons, said: "This is not the first  time it has happened and, if it removes suspicion, so much the better."
