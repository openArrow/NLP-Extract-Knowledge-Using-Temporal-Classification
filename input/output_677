Fighting raged Sunday between the mainly Moslem  Bosnian army and Bosnian Serb troops near the northern Bosnian town of Tuzla,  the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) said in a statement.
The heaviest clashes were centered on the region of Brgule, south of  Tuzla, where members of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) counted 170  explosions along the battle front Saturday.
The UN soldiers reported that they counted more than 150 detonations in  nearby regions including Olovo, Dastansko and Vares.
UNPROFOR added that 92 detonations were heard Saturday in the region of  Sapna, southeast of Tuzla, where a UN armoured vehicle was targeted by machine  gun fire that did not cause any casualties.
It said that fighting was also reported north of Tuzla and confirmed  earlier reports that the Bosnian army was gaining ground and had captured  about 10 square kilometres (four square miles) of territory in the Vijenac  region.
Meanwhile the situation was reported relatively calm throughout the rest  of Bosnia Sunday.
A Serb checkpoint along the road leading to Sarajevo airport was reopened  after being shut down Saturday after a Serb soldier was wounded by sniper fire.
In Sarajevo, UN observers Saturday reported that the Serbs had violated  the UN-imposed 20-kilometre (12-mile) exclusion zone around the capital by  placing two anti-aircraft guns inside the area.
