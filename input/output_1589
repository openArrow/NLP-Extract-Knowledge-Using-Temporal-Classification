A French court fined Italian businessman Valter  Lannutti 2,000 francs (360 dollars) and then impounded his new BMW -- worth  530,000 francs (95,000 dollars) -- which police radar recorded hitting the  Paris to Brussels highway at 236 kilometres (146 miles) an hour.
The court at Valenciennes heard that Lannutti, 43, runs a transport firm  in Cueno, Italy. He was caught on the A2 motorway in the north on Tuesday and  tried the same evening under France's new streamlined procedures for tackling  traffic offences.
