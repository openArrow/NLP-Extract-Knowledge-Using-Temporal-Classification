The following is a list of the main United  Nations sanctions against Haiti, provided for by UN Security Council  resolution 917 and which came into force at 0400 GMT Sunday:
COMPLETE COMMERCIAL EMBARGO:
- The embargo covers all imports and exports, with the exception of  medicines, foodstuffs, certain oil products for domestic use and work  materials required by journalists.
- All states are called upon to interrupt all maritime traffic to and from   Haiti where necessary to inspect cargo content and destination.
PERIOD OF GRACE:
- The commercial embargo comes into force in addition to the oil and  military embargo reimposed by the Council last October, following the Haitian  military's refusal to sign an accord reestablishing democratic rule.
SANCTIONS TARGETING THE MILITARY: (These came into force May 6)
- Ban on non-commercial flights: All states will refuse without delay to  allow any aircraft to take off from their territory, to land there or fly over  their airspace if that aircraft is flying to or from Haitian territory, unless  the flight concerned is a regular commercial passenger flight.
- The granting of visas to Haitian military staff is forbidden: All states  will have to refuse entry to all Haitian military or police officers and  members of their immediate families, and to participants in the September 1991  coup, as well as to members of illegal governments in place since the coup and  their immediate families. The sanctions committee of the United Nations will  draw up a list for people (numbering 600, according to US diplomats) covered  by this ban.
- Freezing of financial assets: The offshore funds and financial resources  of all the people included on the list are to be frozen.
THE LIFTING OF SANCTIONS:
The Security Council is ready to envisage a "progressive suspension" of the  sanctions on the basis of progress towards the reestablishment of democracy.  However, the sanctions will not be completely removed unless the following  conditions are fulfilled:
1: The removal from power of Raoul Cedras, commander-in-chief of the armed  forces and the resignation or removal from Haiti of Joseph Michel Francois,  head of Port-au-Prince police, along with that of army chief of staff Philippe  Biamby, in addition to the removal or departure from Haiti of police chiefs  and military high command.
2: The adoption of measures stipulated in the Governor's Island accord  (July 1993) and the creation of conditions allowing for the holding of free  and fair elections.
3: The creation by the authorities of conditions allowing for the  deployment of the United Nations Mission in Haiti.
4: The return as soon as possible of (democratically-elected) President  Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in exile in Washington, and the retention of  constitutional order.
