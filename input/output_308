North Korea is willing to hold talks with the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to try and narrow differences  between the two on the replacement of fuel rods at a controversial nuclear  plant, the IAEA announced Friday.
The agency said that the date and location of the "working-level  discussions" had not been decided. The North Korean decision was in response  to an invitation by the IAEA.
Meanwhile a team of IAEA inspectors are to head to North Korea this  weekend to inspect various nuclear facilities there, IAEA spokesman David Kyd  said earlier.
The inspectors will visit the nuclear plant at Yongbyon, but will not be  allowed access to the plant's five megawatt reactor, which the United States  suspects is being used to produce nuclear weapons.
In March an IAEA team was denied access to the same reactor, from which it  hoped to collect spent fuel rod samples to determine whether any were being  diverted for military purposes.
Kyd said that the upcoming trip would last eight days although it could be  extended if necessary.
He said that although the inspectors would not be allowed to accomplish  their full mission "they will be able to do most of their work, which is  satisfactory for us."
