The leader of Malawi's Alliance for Democracy  (AFORD), Chakufwa Chihana, has described the election defeat of President  Hastings Kamuzu Banda by a rival candidate as a victory for the whole country.
Chihana, who came third in the presidential race in which Banda was ousted  by Bakili Muluzi of the United Democratic Front (UDF), said:"The victory here  is the victory for the whole nation.
"I have never lost. You should congratulate me for being in democracy,"  Chihana was quoted as saying by the Nation newspaper.
Chihana's party won all 33 parliamentary seats in the northern region in  Tuesday's poll, while Banda's party did well in the centre and the UDF swept  the south, prompting calls from AFORD members for a federal system of  government.
But Chihana urged his supporters to abandon the idea.
"Federation would not help us. We are a small, poor country. Malawi cannot  sustain a federal system. Let's keep this as one country," he said.
Chihana said he had not heard about the UDF's offer of a coalition  government if it does not win an absolute majority in the 177-seat parliament.
"I don't know of the UDF offer and you don't join a night club or a  football club without appreciating the rules of the club," he said.
The UDF has said it could seek a coalition with AFORD, but ruled out  joining forces with Banda's Malawi Congress Party.
Official results of the election were due to be announced later Friday,  with Muluzi being sworn in at a ceremony in Blantyre Saturday.
