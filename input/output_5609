Taiwan's parliament has approved a stringent budget  for fiscal 1995 beginning July 1 with a 3.34 percent drop in value from the  current fiscal year, parliamentary officials said Tuesday.
The parliament, or Legislative Yuan, on Monday finished the third reading  of the 1,029.2 billion Taiwan dollar (38.05 billion US) budget, after slashing  22.6 billion Taiwan dollars, or 2.15 percent, from what cabinet had initially  proposed, the officials said.
Total revenue for 1995 however was forecast at 863.3 billion Taiwan  dollars, representing a deficit of 165.9 billion dollars against total  spending, they said.
The deficit, which was 33 percent lower than the previous fiscal year's  248.5 billion Taiwan dollars, would be offset by the issuing of government  bonds worth 170 billion Taiwan dollars and a 18.5 billion Taiwan dollar  budgetary surplus from the currant year, they said.
Despite the planned deficit, the 1995 budget marked the second consecutive  yearly decline in government spending at 15.64 percent of the country's gross  domestic product, they said. The fiscal 1994 budget saw a 0.55 percent slide  over the previous year.
Defense spending was cropped by 5.5 billion Taiwan dollars from the  previous year to 236.9 billion Taiwan dollars, or 23 percent of total  expenditure, the officials said.
Appropriation for social welfare was raised by 46 percent to account for  13.5 percent of total expenditure.
Outlay for economic development was reduced by 16.8 percent from the  previous year to 14.1 percent. Education and cultural activities share 15.3  percent.
Debt servicing would be allocated 9.3 percent of the budget, while general  administration and a special pension fund would get 9.3 and 9.2 percent,  respectively, and subsidies to local governments 2.8 percent. The majority of  the balance would be taken up by community development projects and  environmental protection.
