An Israeli commando abducted overnight the  leader of a militant Islamic group from the Bekaa region of eastern Lebanon,  an Israeli army spokesman said Saturday.
He said the soldiers seized Mustafa Dirani, the leader of the small  Faithfull Resistance group which in October 1986 captured Israeli airman Ron  Arad.
Arad was taken prisoner when his plane was shot down over Sidon.  He is  the only Israeli prisoner of war in Lebanon still presumed to be alive.
