Vietnam suffered a 150-million-trade deficit in the  first quarter of this year because of continued high imports and a fall in  some exports, the union newspaper Lao Dong said Sunday.
Imports during the period stood at 1.09 billion dollars, up 28.6 percent  over the same period last year, while exports totaled only 940 million  dollars, up 17.1 percent, the newspaper said.
The newspaper said exports of pewter, rice, meat and silk had dropped.
The most lucrative exports during the period were oil, coal, latex,  coffee, tea and marine products, it said.
For the whole of 1993 Vietnam reported a trade deficit of 200 million  dollars on imports of 3.2 billion dollars and exports of three billion dollars.
