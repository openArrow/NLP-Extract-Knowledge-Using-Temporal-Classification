President Bill Clinton and his  wife, Hillary, will attend Monday's burial of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis at  Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia, the White House said Saturday.
Hillary Clinton also will attend Onassis' private funeral in New York  earlier Monday.
The First Lady will accompany members of Onassis' family and other  mourners on a chartered plane carrying the former first lady's remains to  Washington, said deputy White House press secretary Ginny Terzano.
Clinton will meet his wife and other mourners at National Airport and  accompany them to the suburban Washington cemetery, where he will speak at the  burial ceremony, she said.
Onassis, who died of cancer Thursday at age 64, will be buried alongside  her first husband, slain president John F. Kennedy. Two of the couple's  children are also buried there -- a daughter who was stillborn in 1956 and a  son who died shortly after birth in 1963.
Onassis was also the widow of Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis.
The Clintons were both invited to her funeral at St. Ignatius of Loyola  Roman Catholic Church in Manhattan but the president chose not to attend  because he believed his presence could conflict with the family's desire to  keep it private, she said.
"The White House is ready to assist the Kennedy family in any way," added  Terzano, speaking in Sacramento where Clinton was wrapping up a two-day visit  to California. The family did not request any help, she added.
In Washington, a spokeswoman for Arlington National Cemetery said that  access to the gravesite for the public and press will be barred all day  Monday, at the Kennedy family's request.
Contradicting an earlier report that the entire cemetery would be closed  for the burial, the spokeswoman said that had not yet been decided.
"If they want to keep it private, we will honor their wishes," Terzano  said.
