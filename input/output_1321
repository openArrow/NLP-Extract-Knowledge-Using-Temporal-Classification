The new Palestinian police  force on Tuesday called on Gazans to cooperate and to consider any further  bloodshed as banned by the Islamic faith.
In a first official statement, police chief General Nasr Yussef said: "We  have before us a mission which can not be taken lightly, such as the building  of our state and the raising of living standards.
"Only the maintenance of security, order and calm is likely to bring  success to our mission. We ask you to cooperate with us to achieve this  difficult objective."
The statement then adopted Islamic religious vocabulary, proclaiming "from  this day and until eternity ... any shedding of Palestinian blood is  forbidden, just like renunciation of the faith."
The appeal came hours before Israeli forces were expected to complete  their redeployment on the Strip, leaving the police in charge of order in all  but the 20 Jewish settlements of the territory.
During six-and-a-half years of intifada or uprising, Palestinians have  murdered more than 900 fellow Palestinians for alleged collaboration with the  Israelis, according to Israeli army figures.
But the army says the majority were drug addicts, dealers, prostitutes,  common criminals or simply victims of vendettas.
