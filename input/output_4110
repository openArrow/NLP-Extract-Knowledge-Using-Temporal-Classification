An independent China-watching bi-monthly  magazine will close next month due to financial problems after more than a  decade in business, the publishing house said Thursday.
The Chinese-language magazine Pai Shing, set up by local literary figure  Hu Chu-jen, will publish its last edition on June 1, after a recent decision  by the board of directors to shut down due to heavy financial losses.
The magazine has often annoyed China with its sharp criticism of the  communist government.
In an expansion move, Hu reportedly invited his close friend Hong Kong  businessman T.T. Shu to invest 30 million Hong Kong dollars (3.89 million US)  in the magazine early last year, but it failed to increase circulation from  20,000 copies.
For eight months last year, Shu turned the magazine into a weekly, but the  effort failed, and went back to being bi-monthly.
According to a press report, the magazine lost more than 20 million  dollars.
