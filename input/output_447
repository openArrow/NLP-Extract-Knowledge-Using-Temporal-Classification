The Chinese government will increase aid to the  100 million poorest people, whose plight has been worsened by the country's  economic miracle, according to Civil Affairs Minister Doje Cering.
"The living conditions of the poor may be worsening for a time due to  inflation," the China Daily quoted the minister as saying on Saturday.
He added that financial and material aid to the poor would be a government  priority for the next five years, but emphasised that inflation would "also  make the government's social relief more difficult."
Inflation has risen 20 percent since the start of the year and in some  cities is runing at more than 30 percent. The gap between poor and rich  regions is growing ever wider in a country that officially has only 30 million  people living below the poverty level, fixed at 200 yuan (23 dollars) a year.
As the number of beggars and homeless increase with each new liberalising  reform of the economy, the government is fully aware growing poverty could  cause social and political instability.
