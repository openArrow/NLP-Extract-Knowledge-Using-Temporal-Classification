South Africa's estimated maize crop for the 1994  season dropped slightly in May to 12.39 million tons, according to official  figures received Friday.
The latest estimate is down from the 12.52 tons that was predicted in  April, but still well up on the 9.07 tons produced during 1993.
The Department of Agriculture said it was expected that 6.11 tons of white  maize and 6.27 tons of yellow maize would be harvested this year from the 3.9  million hectares planted.
South Africa's maize requirements are estimated at eight million tons  annually, meaning the country will be able to export surplus maize this year  to neighbouring states, where crop yields have been poor.
