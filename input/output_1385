More than 5,000 angry pig farmers  demonstrated in this Lower Saxony town Tuesday against European Union-ordered  slaughter of their animals to prevent the spread of swine-fever.
They marched wearing black and bearing crosses and coffins.
Pig-farmers in Germany, who have repeatedly protested over the months  against the EU measures which they regard as excessive, unfair and a threat to  their livelihood, plan further demonstrations.
Lower Saxony peasant farmers' association president Wilhelm Niemeyer  accused the authorities in Brussels of taking a different attitude towards  "mad-cow disease" affecting cattle in Britain and swine-fever in Germany.
Yet, according to Niemeyer, swine-fever posed no danger to humans, while  that was not certain regarding bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
He said 900,000 pigs had been slaughtered "without reason" on orders from  the European Commission, although only 64 holdings accounting for 50,000  animals had been infected by the disease.
The slaughter of a million pigs meant the loss of 5,000 jobs, he said.
The pig-farmers are calling for a targeted vaccination programme rather  than the current general ban on exporting pigs from Lower Saxony.
