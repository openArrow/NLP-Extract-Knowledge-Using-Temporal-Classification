The dollar dropped against most major currencies  in New York Wednesday as traders sold off hedge funds and cut their losses.
Gold, meanwhile, rose to 383.60 dollars an ounce, up 2.20 dollar from late  Tuesday.
At about 1:15 p.m. (1715 GMT), the dollar traded at 1.6562 German marks,  down from 1.6640 several hours earlier and from 1.6720 late Tuesday in New  York.
Against the yen, it stood at 103.56, down from 103.80 earlier and 104.55  in New York.
The US currency slipped against other major European currencies, falling  to 5.6700 French francs from 5.7340 late Tuesday, to 1.4082 Swiss francs  (1.4220) and to 0.6633 pound sterling (0.6658).
Sell-offs to cut losses and sell-offs of hedge funds began when the dollar  fell below 1.66 German marks, said David Wilson, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais  in New York.
He said speculators would test the central banks by pushing the dollar to  1.64 marks, the level at which the central banks last intervened, on May 4.
The stock and bond markets advanced Tuesday after the Fed raised two key  interest rates a half percentage point each.
