Britain's refusal to comment on reports that an  Iranian diplomat is being expelled from the country is a fresh provocation  against Iran, the official agency IRNA said Sunday.
"In the current circumstances all hostile action by London could provoke a  strong reaction in Iran," the agency said, quoting observers of Iran-Britain  relations.
The daily Guardian reported Saturday in London that Iranian charge  d'affaires Gholamreza Ansari was being expelled from Britain after a meeting  with Foreign Office Minister of State Douglas Hogg.
British government officials said later Iran and Britain had reached an  agreement not to say anything about the affair, but the Foreign Office  confirmed a meeting had taken place.
IRNA countered that London was "trying to exploit this meeting between Mr.  Hogg and Mr. Ansari to spread propaganda" about Iran.
And state-run radio charged that Britain was trying to divert attention  away from the scandal that bugging devices had allegedly been found in the  Iranian embassy in London.
President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said earlier in May that a  listening device had been found in the embassy, just before London accused  Tehran of having contacts with the outlawed Irish Republican Army (IRA).
The IRA is leading a bloody campaign to end British rule in Northern  Ireland.
