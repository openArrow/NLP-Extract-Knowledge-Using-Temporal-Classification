Karl Wendlinger's condition was unchanged  here on Friday morning, the Austrian Formula One driver remaining in a deep  coma after his crash in Monaco on Thursday, hospital officials said.
Wendlinger was badly injured when he crashed during a practice session for  the Monaco Grand Prix. He appeared to brake late coming out of the tunnel, the  fastest point on the street circuit.
His parents arrived here overnight by car, and went immediately to their  son's bedside.
A medical bulletin on the Austrian was due to be issued later in the day.
The accident came two weeks after Brazil's triple world champion Ayrton  Senna and Austrian Roland Ratzenberger were killed at the San Marino Grand  Prix.
