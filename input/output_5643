Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak urged the  Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) to revise its aims to fit the "new world order" as  he opened its 11th foreign ministers' conference here on Tuesday.
"Let us agree in this conference to set a new schedule for our movement to  direct our efforts ...  so that we do not lose our past, but live our present  and look to our futures," Mubarak told the opening ceremony.
"We are not in need of turning the movement into a bloc that ... fears the  establishment of the new world order," he said. "Our real need is to  participate with thought and work."
The NAM could not afford to shut itself out, but had to become integrated  with the rest of the world on all levels, including politically and  economically, he said.
The conference is to set up a committee to re-examine the role of NAM with  the ending of the Cold War and superpower rivalry which had led to the  movement's creation almost 40 years ago.
It would have to deal with the "new reality" of GATT, Mubarak added, and  open dialogues with all countries, big and small.
The NAM, which groups 109 developing countries, also had to find a  "scientific and objective view" to resolve the regional conflicts erupting  among its member states, Mubarak said.
Several of NAM's member states, including Yemen, Rwanda and Bosnia, have  slid into civil war.
Representatives of more than 80 countries are gathered for the ministerial   conference, during which officials will try to find a new direction.  Delegates will also decide on a new venue for the next conference and the next  chairman.
