A three-member team from the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived in Pyongyang Tuesday on a crucial visit to  inspect North Korea's controversial nuclear programme, the Japanese media  reported.
The Japan Broadcasting Corp. said the IAEA inspectors arrived at Pyongyang  aboard a North Korean airliner on a flight from Beijing, where the team had a  24-hour stopover.
The delegation comprises Olli Heinonen of Finland, Vladimir Rukhlo, a  Russian, and Jamaluddin Omar, a Tanzanian.
North Korea announced on Saturday that it was beginning to replace fuel  rods at the Yongbyon nuclear site, 90 kilometers (54 miles) north of  Pyongyang, without the presence of IAEA monitors.
The IAEA, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, has insisted on viewing  the operation, saying it is vital for vetting suspicions about North Korea's  nuclear programme. According to the United States, the procedure could release  enough plutonium for at least four nuclear bombs.
