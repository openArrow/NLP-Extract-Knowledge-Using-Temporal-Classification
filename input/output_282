PLO leader Yasser Arafat said here Friday, as  Palestinian police took control of Jericho, that he aimed to travel to the  West Bank town in mid-June.
The Palestinians will hold elections "very soon," following the launch of  self-rule in Jericho and the Gaza Strip, he told reporters at PLO headquarters  in the Tunisian capital.
The elections were originally to have taken place in July but have been  delayed until October.
Arafat, however, said he was "not in a hurry" to complete the line-up of  the 24-member Palestinian Authority to run Gaza and Jericho. So far, only 15  members have been named to the team, which the PLO leader is to chair.
The elections would also need thorough preparation, warned Arafat. "We  cannot rely on the data provided by the Israelis" to draw up electoral lists  and for other administrative tasks.
Arafat and the European Commission vice president, Manuel Marin, earlier  signed accords for 12 million dollars in EU aid for the new Palestinian police  force and two million dollars to hold the elections.
"Things have started to move in a more flexible way than before," said the  PLO leader, welcoming the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Jericho.
Marin said the start of Palestinian self-rule was an "event of the  century," ranking alongside the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He said the European Commission had accepted an offer from Arafat to set  up an office in Jericho to help the Palestinian Authority.
The EU was also to finance the building of a new 200-bed hospital in Gaza  City, he said, apart from helping the launch of Palestinian television and  radio stations.
