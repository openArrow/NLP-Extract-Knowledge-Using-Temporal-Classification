Rao met with Defense Secretary William Perry on Wednesday when the prickly  issue of nuclear non-proliferation and the sale of the fighter jets to  Pakistan were discussed.
The United States says it has pressed the nuclear issue as critical for  international security because of rising Indian-Pakistan tensions in Kashimir  that it fears could escalate into a nuclear exchange.
During his trip, Rao has persistently focused on the new economic  relationship between the United States and India that has benefitted from  Rao's wide-ranging economic reforms instituted three years ago.
Trade between the two countries last year totalled 7.3 billion dollars and  Rao repeatedly told business leaders here and Congress on Wednesday that his  country's labor market, huge domestic market and democratic system offers  tremendous investment opportunities.
During his congressional address, Rao also touched on the issue of human  rights, saying India is determined that "the rights of minority groups must be  protected vigorously."
But he also defended the government's right to protect those from "the  most dangerous threat to the violation of human rights, namely, the bullets of  terrorists."
As he spoke, a group of Sikhs and Kashmiris protested outside Congress and  Human Rights Watch/Asia and Physicians for Human Rights released a report  highly critical of India's anti-insurgency campaign.
Indian police murdered and tortured hundreds of Sikhs during the  decade-long insurgency in Punjab, state-sanctioned methods that are also used  in Kashmir, the human rights groups charged.
