Sporadic fighting between Rwandan rebels and  government forces continued in Kigali overnight with both sides exchanging  artillery and small arms fire, a UN spokesman said Saturday.
But the clashes subsided early Saturday and UN troops planned to continue  evacuating civilians from the rebel-besieged capital during the lull,  spokesman Abdul Kabia said, contacted by telephone from Nairobi.
Rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) soldiers and increasingly battle-weary  government forces were exchanging heavy artillery fire around the the northern  town of Ruhengeri, he said.
UN soldiers on Friday moved some 480 members of both Hutu and Tutsi tribes  to the outskirts of Kigali.
Another 1,500 displaced Tutsis left the Amahoro stadium on their own for  the RPF-controlled northern town of Mulindi.
Kabia attributed the low intensity of the fighting to a request by the  United Nations for both sides to observe a truce until Monday to allow UN  peacekeepers to evacuate civilians.
He could not confirm RPF claims that they had captured Ruhango, 50  kilometres (30 miles) southwest of Kigali.
Government troops and Hutu militias abandoned several positions as RPF  fighters tightened their grip on the capital.
Rwanda plunged back into tribal bloodletting after Hutu President Juvanal  Habyarimana was killed in an alleged rocket attack on his plane on April 6.
An estimated 200,000 to half a million people have been killed. Some  500,000 others have fled the country.
Many of the victims came from the Tutsi minority or were moderate members  of the majority tribe, massacred by extremist Hutu militias.
