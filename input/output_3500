Palestinian police arrested three  Jewish settlers as they shopped in a market here on Tuesday and confiscated  their guns, a settlement official said.
"They were quietly buying vegetables in the Jericho market, as we have  done for the past 20 years, when Palestinian policemen arrested them and  confiscated their weapons," said Ilana Levy, secretary of the nearby Namaa  settlement.
The settlers were held for an hour in the police station of this  autonomous town and then freed, but were not given back their guns, she said.
The security chief of Naama, located north of Jericho, Ariel Shahar, was  among those detained.
Jordan valley settlements spokesman Shaya Segal charged that one  Palestinian policeman "cocked his gun and pointed it at the three settlers,  forcing them to hand over their weapons."
"Another policeman ordered them to raise their arms and carried out a body  search. The settlers went along with him rather than cause any trouble," he  added.
A large number of Naama settlers were heading to Jericho's joint  Palestinian-Israeli District Coordination Office to seek explanations and  request the weapons be given back, Levy said.
"This incident will cause a lot of trouble. It would be a scandal if we  could not freely enter Jericho, where everybody knows us and where we have  never had any problems," she added.
The May 4 Israel-PLO agreement allows Israeli and Palestinian civilians to  carry weapons for self-defense, provided they possess permits.
Palestinian police on Monday fired on an Israeli car which drove through a  joint checkpoint in the other self-rule region, the Gaza Strip, without  stopping.
The Israeli radio said Israel and Palestinian officials were considering  translating from English to Arabic the May 4 agreement in order to allow the  Palestinian policemen to read it.
