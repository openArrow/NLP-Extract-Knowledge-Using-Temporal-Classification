Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic flew  Thursday to Zagreb for emergency talks on the situation in the Bihac pocket in  northwestern Bosnia, under Serb attack, Bosnia's representative said here.
Silajdzic, who headed his delegation at two days of peace talks in the  French lake resort of Talloires, near Switzerland, flew from Geneva aboard the  same plane taking back the Bosnian Croat delegation, Mustapha Bijedic said.
It was not immediately known who Silajdzic would be meeting in Zagreb, but  Bijedic said "the situation was very serious" in the Moslem-held Bihac pocket.
"The Serbs have launched an offensive against one of the UN safe areas in  Bosnia (Bihac) and Mr. Akashi (the UN's special envoy to Yugoslavia) and the  West are doing nothing," Bijedic said.
The UN Protection Force in Bosnia (UNPROFOR) confirmed that Serb forces  have launched an offensive over the past 24 hours against Bihac, the western  tip of Bosnia tucked into Croatia and besieged by Serb forces.
The Serbs managed "a small advance" after firing more than 500 shells at  Moslem positions on Wednesday, UNPROFOR said.
Bijedic refused to give any details on the two days of closed-door talks  Wednesday and Thursday in the French Alpine hideaway which involved the  warring parties, along with representatives of the United States, Russia, the  European Union and the United Nations.
The parties have agreed however to meet again in about 10 days, he said.
Aleska Buha, foreign minister of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb  republic, said the talks would again take place in Talloires.
