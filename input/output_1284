GATT director general Peter Sutherland is to  address Hong Kong business leaders at a luncheon on May 26, the Hong Kong  General Chamber of Commerce said Tuesday.
Sutherland, who last week dashed China's hopes of a prompt return to the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), will be in the territory for  two days following a Pacific Basin Economic Council meeting in Kuala Lumpur.
"Given China's application to rejoin GATT and the changing environment  following the completion of the Uruguay Round, it is anticipated that Mr.  Sutherland will deliver a major policy speech," a chamber statement said.
Co-organizing Sutherland's address at the Regent Hotel is the Hong Kong  Trade Development Council.
