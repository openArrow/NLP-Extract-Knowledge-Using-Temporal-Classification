Danes marry latest, Portuguese drivers are the  worst and women live longest in France, were a few of the discoveries to be  gleaned from European Union statistics published Tuesday.
The Eurostat bureau's small but informative leaflet provides a useful  insight into the varying life-styles of the 12 nations who make up the EU.
For instance, France is the country where life expectancy is longest for  women (81.5 years) whereas men live longest in Greece (74.6).
The EU average is 73.7 years for men and 80 for women.
The Danes wait longest to get married with the average age for men being  30.5 and 28 for women. British couples on the other hand marry youngest; men  at 25.8 years, women at 23.9 years.
Denmark also has the highest number of children born out of wedlock with  46.4 percent.  This compares with an EU average of 19.5 percent.
The percentages for other EU members are: 31.8 for France, 30.8 for  Britain, 15.4 for Germany, 11.6 for Belgium, 6.8 in Italy and 2.6 for Greece.
EU residents have an average of 2.7 doctors and 0.5 dentists for every  1,000 people.
Greeks have the highest number of doctors with 4.3 per 1,000 people.
The Portuguese have only 0.1 dentist per 1,000 people whereas Danes and  Greeks are best off with one per thousand.
Infant mortality was highest in Portugal and Luxembourg - respectively 9.3  and 8.7 per thousand births. German and Dutch maternities were statistically  the safest with 6.2 and 6.3 deaths per thousand births respectively.
On the roads, Portuguese drivers were the most likely to be killed with an  annual death toll of 2.68 motorist for every 10,000 people.
In Luxembourg the figure was also high at 2.13 per 10,000. The figure for  Belgium was 1.88/10,000 and for France 1.69/10,000.
Despite a fairly low birthrate of 11.4 per thousand, the population of the  12 existing EU countries, now around 347 million people, is expected to grow  by 6.0 percent by 2020, when the union itself will have expanded by at least  four new states.
