Steffi Graf and French teenager Mary Pierce didn't  disappoint organisers, fans or ticket touts here on Tuesday when they raced to  a potentially-explosive women's singles semi-final showdown at the French Open.
Both players have been chalking up one-sided victories since the  Championships started nine days ago and their clash on Thursday is sure to  pack the Roland Garros centre-court.
It was a case of 'anything you can do I can do better' as the two players  charged through their quarter-finals.
Defending champion Graf saw off Ines Gorrochategui -- the girl they are  calling the new Sabatini, in just 66 minutes.
Pierce went even faster. She needed nine minutes less to overwhelm  Austria's Petra Ritter.
Graf, 24 and chasing a fifth consecutive major title, had to shift gear in  the second set against a player four years her junior who undoubtedly has a  big future in the game.
The raven-haired Gorrochategui, who had won only one match in two visits  to the Championships, quickly showed her paces and proved that her victories  over experienced 15th-seed Helena Sukova and emerging Croatian teenager Iva  Majoli in previous rounds were by no means flukes.
Although she nervously hit two double-faults in her opening service game,  she saved two break points -- rising like a salmon on the second to send a  backhand volley scorching across court.
She went on to hold and then had a chance to make a vital break in the  fifth game when Graf, who needed on-court treatment after some clay got into  her eye, went 0-40 down on serve.
Graf, falling back on her wealth of experience, surged back and in the  very next game she went 4-2 clear.
To her credit the South American broke back for 4-5 but Graf quickly  closed up shop.
