Republic of Ireland manager Jack Charlton Monday  night named a 22-man squad for World Cup warm-up games against Bolivia in  Dublin on May 24 and Germany in Hanover five days later.
Barring injuries, the same players are likely to carry Irish hopes in the  finals in America next month.
There are no real surprises.
Newcomers Phil Babb, Gary Kelly and Jason McAteer have earned their  passports after impressive performances in recent games against Russia and  Holland.
But it looks as though there will be no place for veteran David O'Leary,  plagued by injuries since his move from Arsenal to Leeds at the start of the  season.
Charlton was away from it all when the squad was named. He was on a  fishing holiday in the west of Ireland.
Squad: Bonner (Celtic), A Kelly (Sheffield United), G Kelly (Leeds),  Phelan (Manchester City), Irwin (Manchester United), Moran (Blackburn),  McGrath (Aston Villa), Kernaghan (Manchester City), Babb (Coventry), Staunton  (Aston Villa), McGoldrick (Arsenal), Houghton (Aston Villa), Townsend (Aston  Villa), Keane (Manchester United), McLaughlin (Portsmouth), Whelan  (Liverpool), McAteer (Bolton), Sheridan (Sheffield Wednesday), Aldridge  (Tranmere), Coyne (Motherwell), Cascarino (Chelsea), D Kelly (Wolves).
