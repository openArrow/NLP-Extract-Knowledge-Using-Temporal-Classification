Yemen on Monday warned all foreign aircraft and  ships to stay out of the country's southern war zone.
"The government of the Republic of Yemen will have no responsibility  whatsoever for damage or losses" if planes and ships make stops in the  southern provinces of Aden, Hadhramaut and Mahra, the transport ministry said.
All ports and airports in the three provinces, including the oil port of  Mukalla in Hadhramaut, are war zones, it said.
The Cyprus-based Middle East Economic Survey, meanwhile, said that owners  of tankers calling at Yemeni ports were having to pay higher premiums to cover  war risks.
The Institute of London Underwriters, Lloyd's Underwriters Association and  Norwegian Underwriters notified marine insurance customers that all Yemeni  ports were part of "war risk excluded areas" from May 17, it said.
Civil war broke out on May 5 between northern and southern Yemen. On  Saturday, the south declared itself independent.
