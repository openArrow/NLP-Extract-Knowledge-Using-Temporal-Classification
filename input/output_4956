Formula one world championship supremo  Max Mosley on Saturday denied his authority had been undermined.
As president of the International Automobile Federation, Mosley reacted  angrily to suggestions that he had given in to threats at a crisis meeting  with rebel team owners on Friday.
The rebel bosses reportedly threatened to boycott Sunday's Spanish Grand  Prix in order to force the FIA into giving them power to decide on how to  improve the safety of their cars.
Not so, insisted Mosley in a prepared statement.
"Suggestions that the FIA or any of its officers have made concessions or  abandoned powers are wholly false," he said.
"At no time did the teams seek concessions or threaten not to run in the  qualifying practice session on Friday.
"The FIA owns and runs the formula one world champoionship. Teams will  participate on that basis or not at all."
