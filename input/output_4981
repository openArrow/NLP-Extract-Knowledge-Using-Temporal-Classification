England crashed to their third defeat of  their South African tour after a dramatic finale against champions Transvaal.
They lost 24-21 as three tries, two conversions and three penalties were  scored in the final ten minutes -- but England, who were forced to replace  injured scrum-half Dewi Morris, never deserved to steal the result.
Fly-half Andrew, who had earlier scored a try, did attempt the impossible  with a 70-yard penalty effort but his kick fell five yards short.
Springbok full-back Theo van Rensburg's fourth penalty with two minutes to  go seemed to have killed England off at 24-14 but Rory Underwood was  immediately sent bursting over in the left-hand corner.
Andrew then converted from the touchline befpre attempting the  near-imposible penalty from 15 yards inside his own half.
Transvaal looked dangerous throughout the match, tearing the tourists'  defence to shreds and leaving them with just one win on tour against lowly  Natal.
England argued again that they had struggled to understand referee Ian  Rogers' decisions, although they got their share of penalties until Theo van  Rensburg stepped up for a couple of penalties in the breathtaking conclusion.
Morris was replaced during the second half ahd he must be a doubt for the  first Test in a week.
Transvaal first try came after ten minutes from stand-off Hennie Le Roux.  Theo van Rensburg and Andrew exchanged penalties before Andrew scored his rare  try after a quick piece of thinking.
He fooled Transvaal into believing he was going to take a penalty kick at  goal, the home side turned their backs and Andrew stole over.
Each kicker landed an early penalty at the start of the second half and  the ten minutes of final action began with the pair of them adding a penalty  each to leave the score at 14-14.
England relaxed distastrously from the kick-off and a predictable crisp  passing put right-wing Jaco Louw in for the try that van Rensburg converted  via a post.
