Fire-fighters brought under control Sunday a blaze  at a bomb depot for Russian Pacific fleet warplanes, ITAR-TASS news agency  said, following a massive explosion at the base near the far-eastern Russian  port of Vladivostok.
Overnight rain helped military and civilian fire fighters beat back the  flames at the base, where two armoured vehicles were pressed into service to  help locate the seat of the fire, the agency said.
Saturday's blasts at the base, situated near the village of Novonejino,  shook Vladivostok, 100 kilometres (60 miles) to the south, according to  witnesses cited by the agency.
No casualties were reported in the blast or the ensuing fire.
Several thousand local residents were evacuated from villages in a  30-kilometre (20-mile) radius at the height of the blaze.
The Russian emergency ministry said there were neither chemical nor  nuclear weapons at the depot.
Officials from the Pacific fleet and a counter-espionnage team were sent  to the site Saturday to determine the cause of the explosion, according to  military officials cited by ITAR-TASS.
A special team from the defense ministry left Moscow for the scene  Saturday, the emergency minstry said.
