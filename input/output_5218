Scot Colin McRae and Subaru teammate  Carlos Sainz of Spain made the early running in the Acropolis rally here on  Sunday.
They finished in the top two places, McRae holding a 43 second advantage  and Didier Auriol of France, in a Toyota and fresh from victory in Corsica,  third with a 52sec defecit.
He was in turn followed by his Toyota partner Juha Kankkunen of Finland.
McRae won three of the first five special stages, with Sainz grabbing the  other two, to forge an early advantage that he was not to let go.
But Kankkunen said: "We are very happy with fourth at this point -- the  next leg is very rough and the hardest of the rally. We are pretty confident."
