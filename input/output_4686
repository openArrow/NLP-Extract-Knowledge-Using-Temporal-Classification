The European Boxing Union has ordered Englishman  "Prince" Naseem Hamed to defend his newly-won European bantamweight title just  16 days after taking it from Italy's Vincenzo Belcastro.
Hamed, 20, from Sheffield, must fight another Italian, Antonio Picardi, by  mid-August.
Picardi, loser of three previous European challenges, has taken over the  leading nomination spot from English fighter Johnny Armour, who has been  withdrawn by his manager Mickey Duff.
