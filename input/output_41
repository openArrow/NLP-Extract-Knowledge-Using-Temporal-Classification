Eleven French aid workers held hostage by Bosnian  Serbs forces for the last month will probably be freed next week, the Bosnian  Serb news agency SRNA said Thursday.
Charges against the 11, accused of smuggling weapons to the mainly Moslem  Bosnian army, "will be revised in their favour" and handed to the civil  courts, said the agency, quoting sources close to Bosnian Serb leader Radovan  Karadzic.
"It is expected that (their) preventive detention will be lifted from next  week and they will be returned to freedom," the agency said.
Earlier on Thursday, France's Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told a news  conference in Washington that the group might be freed in the next day or two.
Juppe said France had let it be known it would not accept this "parody of  justice" and would not bargain for their freedom.
"If the news is confirmed, it would be the culmination of a daily effort  by French diplomacy," Juppe said.
The relief workers, members of a group called Premiere Urgence (First  Aid), have been held in a Serb prison since April 8 in the Sarajevo suburb of  Lukavica.
