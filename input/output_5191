Pakistan's main opposition parties ended a  boycott of the National Assembly on Sunday, and came back with a a blistering  attack on Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
"The country is on the verge of economic collpase," thundered opposition  leader Nawaz Sharif, a former prime minister, in a speech on the opening day  of the parliamentary budget session.
The boycott had been announced in February in protest against the sacking  of the opposition-led provincial government in the North West Frontier  Province by President Farooq Ahmed Leghari.
Demanding Bhutto's resignation because of what he called economic  mismanagement and a deteriorating law and order situation in the country,  Sharif said new elections should be organized by an impartial government.
The opposition's return to the house was apparently aimed at confronting  the eight-month-old Bhutto government on economic issues as it presents the  national budget on June 9, observers said.
Speaking to reporters, Bhutto said the budget would be "very tough" and  blamed Sharif, who ruled from 1990 until his resignation in July last year  amid a political crisis, for damaging the economy with what she called lavish  spending.
Bhutto welcomed the end of the opposition boycott, saying she would invite  opposition leaders to talks on economic issues.
But Sharif rejected any dialogue with his arch foe -- a sign that the  opposition was in no mood to defuse a war of words with the government.
