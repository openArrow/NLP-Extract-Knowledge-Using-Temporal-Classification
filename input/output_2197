Four jailed members of the leftwing extremist group  Action Directe serving life terms for murder received additional life terms  Thursday at a court in Paris, judicial officials said.
Under the new terms they will only become eligible for parole after  serving 18 years.
The four, Nathalie Menigon, Joelle Aubron, Jean-Marc Rouillan and Georges  Cipriani, were convicted of a five murders and attacks committed between 1984  and 1986.
Arrested in February 1987, their targets included General Rene Audran, who  was killed in 1985, and defence procurement chief Henri Blandin, who survived  an attempted assassination.
The four were already serving life terms handed down in 1989 for the  murder of Georges Besse, the chairman and managing director of automaker  Renault in 1986.
Their second trial began on May 2.
Thursday's verdict was handed down in a virtually empty coutroom.
All four accused had refused to attend the hearing since May 3 in protest  at what they called "this judicial comedy and administrative ritual".
Only some 30 police were in the court when the sentences were read out.
Another defendant in the second trial, Asieme Rouabh, was acquitted on  related charges after spending 21 months in jail.
