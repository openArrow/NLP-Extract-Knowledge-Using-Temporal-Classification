A record 25 million people were displaced  within their own countries last year, according to a report released Tuesday  by the US Committee for Refugees.
In 1993, there were 1.1 million displaced Angolans, 600,000 Zaireans,  600,000 Burundians, 550,000 Bosnians, 400,000 Azerbaijanis and 240,000  Togolese displaced within their own borders, the Washington-based  non-governmental organization said.
Some 75,000 Rwandans were displaced within the chaotic east African state  last year, the report said, pointing out that 250,000 more Rwandans have fled  the country since the ethnic bloodbath that broke out in early April this year.
However, the number of refugees worldwide dropped last year to 16.3  million from about 17.6 million at the end of 1992, the report said. The  decrease was largely due to the repatriation of Afghans, Mozambicans,  Cambodians, Liberians and Ethiopians.
US Committee for Refugees director Roger Winter accused much of Europe and  the United States of succumbing to anti-foreigner, anti-immigrant pressures.
"They are closing their doors to would-be refugees and in so doing are  setting a dangerous precedent that is likely to erode refugee protection  worldwide," he said.
Winter said the United States was also failing to make a sufficient  contribution to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. "The United States  ranks only tenth on the list of contributions per capita," he said.
