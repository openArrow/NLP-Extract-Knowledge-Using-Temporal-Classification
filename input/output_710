Indonesia urgently needs to act on workers'  rights if it does not want a repetition of last month's worker demonstrations   that left one person dead, a human rights group said in a report released here  Monday.
"Reforms announced by the minister of manpower in January 1994 had, by  early May, had no visible effect on increasing freedom of association or  decreasing military involvement in labor disputes," Human Rights Watch/Asia  said in the report titled "Indonesia: The Medan Demonstrations and Beyond."
A week of labor demonstrations in Medan, and other towns in North Sumatra,  last month degenerated into violence that left one ethnic Chinese dead.
The military blamed the independent trade union SBSI, which has emerged as  a serious challenger to the government-controlled SPSI, for the violence,  while SBSI counter-charged that they were responsible for inciting the  violence and the anti-Chinese element.
Human Rights Watch called for a "full, impartial and independent  investigation" into the events in Medan, but in the longer term urged the  Indonesian government to "remove existing barriers to freedom of association,  allowing workers to organize freely."
This includes "ending military intervention in labor disputes, not just on  paper, but in practice," the report said.
Respect of labor rights are a condition for Jakarta's generalised system  of preferences (GSP) trade status with Washington under US law.
The United States in February suspended its continuous review of  Indonesian labor rights practices to give Jakarta time to take measures to  improve matters, but is to give an assessment of the situation in August.
The US authorities "should ensure that this assessment is rigorous and, if  possible, based on an on-site investigation," the report said.
"If it is found that worker rights have not improved significantly" since  February, Indonesia's GSP should be revoked, it added.
