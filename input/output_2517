The National Basketball Association will  make an extensive investigation before it rules on Roy Tarpley's request for  reinstatement after three violations of its drug policies.
Tarpley, who has been playing in Greece for two seasons, was kicked out of  the NBA on October 16, 1991.
"Now what happens is the investigation into his background," said NBA  spokesman Chris Brienza. "We'll review his actions over the past two years,  including sobriety interviews.
"The whole process takes a few months. Hopefully, we will have a  determination before next season, by the end of the summer."
If Tarpley is reinstated, the Dallas Mavericks will own his rights.
