President Bill Clinton said Tuesday that  short-term interest rates could be raised without slowing down the US economy.
"There is clearly some room for short-term interest (rates) over the rate  of inflation that won't slow down our economic growth," Clinton said at a  morning photo session.
The president's comment came as most analysts were expecting the Federal  Reserve's policy-setting committee to boost short-term interest rates at its  closed-door meeting Tuesday.
Clinton's remark seemed to contradict an earlier White House statement  indicating that another rise in short-term interest rates would not be  justified.
White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said there were few signs of  inflationary pressure, and that "growth is proceeding at a steady pace."
The government's latest Consumer Price Index, published Friday, rose 0.1  percent in April, Myers said, pointing out that the inflation barometer  "showed continued growth with very modest inflationary pressures."
Myers did not say that the Fed should not raise rates, emphasizing that  the central bank "obviously is independent."
The Fed's Open-Market Committee began its meeting at 9:00 a.m. (1300 GMT).  Markets were widely anticipating a hike in the federal funds rate -- the rate  of overnight interbank loans -- between a quarter to a half percentage point.
The federal funds rate stands at 3.75 percent after three Fed moves  bumping it up a quarter percentage point since February 4.
