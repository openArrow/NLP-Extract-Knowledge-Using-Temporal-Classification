Anna Smashanova, a 17-year-old  Minsk-born Israeli, upset home home Emanuela Zardo in straight-sets in the  first-round of the 150,000 dollar women's tennis tournament here Monday.
Smashanova, who recently entered the top-100, first hit the headlines in  1991 when she won the French Open junior crown.
The tiny 5ft 2in Israeli's latest win, over a player seven years older and  ranked 57th, will be a big boost when she opens her first senior campaign at  Roland Garros next week.
Another major suprise was the dismissal of fifth-seeded Natalia Medvedeva  of the Ukraine. She went down 5-7, 6-7 (4/7) to Georgia's newcomer Nino  Louarsabischwili.
Former world number-one Tracy Austin, now 31, continued her comeback after  a decade of injury by beating Geraldine Dondit of Switzerland 6-4, 6-0 while  Japan's Man Endo failed to stop Italian eighth-seed Linda Ferrando and went  down 2-6, 4-6.
