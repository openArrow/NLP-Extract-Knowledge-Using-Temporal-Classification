Negotiators for Bosnia-Hercegovina's  three warring parties and an international contact group resumed closed-door  talks here Thursday to try to establish a ceasefire and work out the country's  division.
There have been no official comments on progress, but a member of the  Croat press contingent who said he had access to the meeting reported that the  Croats and Moslems, who have agreed to form a federation, had dropped demands  for more territory.
He said they had agreed to negotiate on the basis of a European Union plan  backed by the contact group, which is made up of ther United States, Russia,  five western European countries and representatives of the United Nations.
This plan would allot 51 percent of Bosnian territory to the Moslems and  Croats and 49 percent to the Serbs.
The Moslems and Croats now control 30 percent of the republic's territory  and were demanding 58 percent -- about as much as they held before the  two-year-old war. Bosnian Serbs control the remaining 70 percent of the  territory.
The talks started Wednesday in this tourist town near Lake Annecy in the  French Alps, just over the border from Geneva.
Delegates include Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, Bosnian Vice  President Ejup Ganic, the head of the Bosnian Croat community, Kresimir Zubak,  and for the Serbs, the head of their self-proclaimed parliament, Momcilo  Krajisnik.
The contact group is pushing for an immediate four-month ceasefire as a  test of the commitment of the belligerents to reach a settlement.
Both France and Britain have warned they are ready to pull all their  peacekeeping troops out of Bosnia by the end of the year if no serious  progress is made towards restoring peace.
The meeting was to wind up Thursday then mostly likely resume in about 10  days at a location not yet announced to prepare a conference of foreign  ministers around mid-June as a follow-up to one in Geneva on May 13.
