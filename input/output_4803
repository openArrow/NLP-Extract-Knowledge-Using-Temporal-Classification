There were mixed fortunes for England's pace contenders as Phillip  DeFreitas and Devon Malcolm advanced their claims while Chris Lewis's  evaporated in the chill of Ilkeston.
A strained rib muscle prevented Lewis bowling but, on a sluggish pitch,  Malcolm took five wickets, while DeFreitas claimed the prime scalp of West  Indian Jimmy Adams.
Andy Pick also enjoyed himself by polishing off the Derbyshire tail to  finish with 6-62 from 35.4 overs.
But a total of 230 soon looked a formidable one as Nottinghamshire's first  five wickets went down for 90 runs.
Graham Archer supervised a recovery with help from Lewis, who was at least  able to bat, and Gregory Mike before Malcom and Lewis mopped up
Derbyshire still finished with a lead of 31, although they quickly lost  Peter Bowler and night-watchman Richard Sladdin.
Skipper Hugh Morris and Adrian Dale both struck centuries as Glamorgan  made Sussex pay for sending them in at Hove by piling up 384 for five.
Morris cracked 13 fours and six off 179 balls in his 106, while Dale moved  to his century off 156 balls by pulling Ian Salisbury for six over mid-wicket.
A late three-wicket blast by Paul Taylor belatedly revived  Northamptonshire's hopes against Worcestershire at New Road.
The left-arm seamer dismissed Tim Curtis for 49 and Tom Moody (19) in the  space of six balls, immediately after the home side had nosed in front of  Northamptonshire's flimsy total of 112. Worcestershire were 139-5 at the close.
Tim Hancock thwarted Surrey with a dogged 75 after the visitors looked set  to run through the home side at Gloucester.
Gloucestershire slipped to 61 for three but then Hancock, 22, hit his  fourth half-century in five games before being bowled by Benjamin.
Bobby Dawson, playing his first county game this season, dug in to finish  with 18 and Wright was on 47 as Gloucestershire reached 192 for four.
