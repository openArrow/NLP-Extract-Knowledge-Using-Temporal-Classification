A pro-Islamic lawyer, Abdel Hareth Madani, who died  in prison last week, had been tortured to death, an official preliminary  pathologist's report has found.
The office of the state prosecutor said it had called for a final report  and summoned the doctors who carried out the autopsy on Madani's body for more  information.
Prosecutor Raga'a al-Arabi, who ordered the pathologist's report, is also  expected to interrogate the police suspected of involvement in torturing  Madani.
Interior Minister General Hassan al-Alfi, questioned by journalists, said  the matter was still being investigated and that the truth would be made  public.
The Cairo Bar said Monday that Madani's death, notified to his family the  previous Friday, was premeditated murder, while Egyptian and foreign human  rights organisations called on President Hosni Mubarak to clear up the matter.
Madani was arrested on April 26 and taken away to an unknown destination.  The opposition said he had been trying to mediate between the government and  Islamic fundamentalists in the conflict which has killed some 400 people in  the past two years.
