Rwandan rebels pounded government troops with  artillery in Kigali on Monday, delaying the evacuation of civilians by UN  troops, UN officials said.
An army general and a rebel commander were meanwhile expected to open  UN-mediated truce talks later Monday at the UN headquarters, near the Amahoro  stadium where thousands of civilians have taken refuge.
"It's a very tense situation here," UN military spokesman Major Jean-Guy  Plante said. "There's been heavy shelling and a lot of fighting."
Plante said the United Nations had delayed plans to evacuate hundreds of  civilians trapped behind the battle lines in Kigali to safe areas because the  army and the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) had not provided assurances of  security.
"It's all on hold because we still have to negotiate with the RPF and the  armed forces," Plante said.
The heaviest fighting was reported at the notorious Kadhafi Corner south  of the city on the road to Gitarama, where the government sought refuge last  month.
Rebels have advanced to within 10-kilometres (six miles) of Gitarama, and  have cut a possible escape route for the government to the southern town of  Butare, UN military sources said.
Rwanda plunged into tribal bloodletting on April 6 after President Juvenal  Habyarimana died in a suspected rocket attack on his plane.
Since then, up to 500,000 people have died in the fighting that has pitted  the mainly Tutsi RPF against the mainly Hutu government troops.
