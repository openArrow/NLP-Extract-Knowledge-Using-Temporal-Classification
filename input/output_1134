Rwandan rebels sealed the road from the embattled capital Kigali  to Gitarama, where the government fled last month as ethnic carnage engulfed  the country, a UN official said. The army denied their foes had seized control  of the stretch of road 40 kilometres (25 miles) to the southwest. But Abdul  Kabia, head of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda, said the rebel Rwanda  Patriotic Front (RPF) had cut off the road as they tightened their grip on  Kigali, which they have sealed off on three sides.

ADEN: Northern Yemeni troops took the rival south's main air base at  al-Anad, opening the way for a push towards the southern capital Aden, some 50  kilometres (30 miles) to the south, an AFP photographer said. As the northern  soldiers consolidated, opposition parties led by vice-president Ali Salem  al-Baid, the southern leader, announced here they would form a High Council  for National Salvation. (AFP)
PORT-AU-PRINCE: Haiti's army-backed president named a new cabinet after  the country's major political parties refused to join his government. Outgoing  prime minister Robert Malval had earlier urged government employees to refuse  to obey the government of Emile Jonassaint, 81, who was sworn in last week by  the military government that overthrew exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide  in October 1991. The United States immediately denounced the move, calling  Jonassaint "illegitimate" and the new cabinet "bogus." (AFP)
