Rover Japan Ltd. on Wednesday put on sale two new  recreational vehicles, with price tags some three million yen (31,000 dollars)  cheaper than the previous models, company officials said.
The Japanese unit of major British automaker set prices for Range Rover at  5.95 million yen (57,000 dollars), down from previous 8.95 million yen and  Range Rover Vanden Plas at 6.95 million yen, down from 9.9 million yen,  reflecting the company's policy to reduce prices by refunding exchange rate  gains, they said.
Foreign automakers, benefitting from the rapid yen's appreciation, have  been cutting prices, boosting imported car sales in Japan, industry analysts  said.
In April, imported vehicles jumped 45 percent from a year earlier to  24,254 units, the sixth increase in a row and a monthly record, the Japan  Automobile Importers Association said earlier this week.
