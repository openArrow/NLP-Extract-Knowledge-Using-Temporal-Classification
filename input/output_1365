Bosnia's warring factions could be close to  reaching a ceasefire, UN mediator Lord Owen said Tuesday following a  three-hour meeting in Belgrade with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
Owen, co-chairman of the Geneva peace conference on former Yugoslavia said  the meeting had concentrated on the "most important priority" which was ending  the fighting.
He admitted there were "still some difficulties" regarding the eastern  Moslem town of Gorazde, but said he expected these to be ironed out within 24  hours.
After that, "hopefully the parties will come and discuss with Mr. Akashi  the details of the cessation of hostilities on which they have previously come  very close to an agreement," said Owen. He was referring to UN special envoy  Yasushi Akashi.
Owen was accompanied to Belgrade by fellow peace talks co-chairman  Thorvald Stoltenberg.
They were set to meet later Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic before  going on to Zagreb for talks Wednesday evening with Croatian President Franjo  Tudjman.
