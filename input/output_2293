Japan's Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd. said Friday its  pre-tax profit tumbled 79 percent from a year earlier to 1.6 billion yen (15  million dollars) in the year to March, forecasting a modest recovery for this  year.
The company, one of Japan's largest shipping lines, also announced a net  loss of 2.5 billion yen, reversing a net profit of 5.2 billion yen a year  earlier. Revenue was down 9.1 percent at 441 billion yen.
Mitsui, which omitted a dividend payment, forecast slightly better  earnings of two billion yen for this year on increased revenue of 450 billion  yen.
"The severe business environment is expected to continue," the company  said. "The impact of the yen's appreciation on earnings is of concern. In  addition, it is difficult to expect rapid economic recovery in Japan."
In the year just ended, revenue from liners declined 11 percent to 220  billion yen while revenue from tramps was also down 11 percent, falling to 149  billion yen. But tanker revenues were up two percent at 64 billion yen.
Mitsui said revenues were depressed by the sluggish shipping market, which  reflected Japan's economic slump and delayed recovery in major industrialised  countries, as well as the yen's sharp appreciation.
