The head of the Philippines' feared communist urban  guerrillas, Felimon Lagman, was arrested here Thursday, the presidential  palace said.
The palace said naval intelligence agents arrested Lagman in suburban  Quezon city.
A radio report said Lagman, who had recently been giving clandestine press  interviews, was stopped while driving a car and arrested.
Lagman, in his early forties, heads the regional communist party committee  for Manila and adjacent province Rizal, and broke away from exiled communist  leader Jose Maria Sison last year over fundamental differences in strategy.
He controls the Alex Boncayao Brigade (ABB), which claims 500 guerrillas  armed with machine pistols, assault rifles and handguns whose main method of  operation is the public execution of allegedly corrupt and abusive authorities.
His arrest ironically occurred only two days after the ABB celebrated its  10th anniversary with a rally by masked partisans at Manila's financial  district which police forcibly broke up, arresting 11 demonstrators.
Manila police officer Major Timoteo Zarcal, an alleged kidnapping  syndicate leader acquitted recently by a court, was assassinated outside his  home earlier this month by an ABB hit squad.
The communists have been fighting the Manila government for decades, in a  war that has cost thousands of lives.
