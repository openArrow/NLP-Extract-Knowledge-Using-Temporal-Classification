A first batch of 300 Pakistan army personnel  have left for the Slovak Republic to prepare to take part in the international  peacekeeping force in Bosnia-Hercegovina, official reports said Sunday.
They will undergo two weeks training before flying to Bosnia to join the  force.
Two other contingents of 300 soldiers will also go soon to the Slovak  Republic for the same training, the reports said.
The remaining soldiers will be flown to Bosnia directly under a phased  programme which will be completed by June 30, reports said.
Pakistan is to send 3,000 soldiers by June 30 for deployment in Bosnia.  They will operate under UN Security Council resolution 836 on protecting  populations in the conflict zones.
