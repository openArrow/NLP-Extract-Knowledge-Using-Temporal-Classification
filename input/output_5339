Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said Monday its  subsidiary in the United States, Diamond Star Motors Corp. (DSM), would  purchase US auto parts worth more than one billion dollars this year.
Mitusbishi said in March that Diamond Star's purchases of US auto parts  were expected to rise from 650 million dollars in 1993 to between 1.4 billion  and 1.63 billion dollars in 1996.
More than 200 US companies now supply auto parts to Diamond Star,  Mitsubishi officials said.
Washington has urged Tokyo to boost imports of U.S.-made cars and related  parts to help correct the bilateral trade imbalance, heavily in Japan's favor.
