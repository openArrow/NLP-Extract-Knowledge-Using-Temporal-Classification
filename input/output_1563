The lure of rising commodity prices drew eager  currency traders into a scramble for Australian dollars Wednesday which  propelled the unit to an 18-month high.
The domestic currency climbed over a 73.00 US cent barrier to peak at  73.21 US cents in early trade before closing at 73.09 US cents and analysts  said it could hit 73.50 US cents within 24 hours.
Ivana Bottini, chief economist at Societe Generale Australia, said the  Australian dollar would reach 75.00 US cents by the end of calendar 1994 if  world growth continued to buoy commodity prices.
"The outlook for the Australian dollar is positive because international  commodity prices are going up. In addition to that there is a lot of offshore  interest in our markets, particularly the stock market," she added.
Investors pouring cash into resource companies sent the Australian stock  market's barometer, the all ordinaries index, to a high of 2,120.4 points  before it closed at 2,107.8 points -- 11.8 points above its last finish.
Bond markets also rallied after the US Federal Reserve Board hiked the key  discount rate to 3.5 percent from 3.0 percent Tuesday. Benchmark September  2004 Commonwealth bond yields dropped 32 basis points to 8.39 percent from  8.71 percent at the close of business Tuesday.
