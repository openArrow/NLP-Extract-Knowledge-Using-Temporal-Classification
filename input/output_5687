The chairman and president of China Airlines (CAL)  offered to resign Tuesday to take responsibility for a plane crash in Japan  last month that killed 264 people.
Chairman Liu Teh-min told reporters that he and president Yuan Hsin-yuan  had done this "to take responsibility" for the tragedy. He refused to comment  further.
It was not immediately known whether their resignations had been accepted  by the national flag carrier's board of directors.
The crash of the Airbus 300-600R occurred April 26 at Nagoya, Japan, as it  was preparing to land.
In addition to compensation for families of victims from Taiwan, Japan,  the Philippines and South Korea, the crash forced the airline to lower its  projections for both profits and passengers.
CAL has revised downwards its projected pre-tax profits for this year from  3.43 billion Taiwan dollars (130 million US) to around three billion. Its  passenger levels were down seven percent on international flights and 10  percent on domestic flights.
CAL has announced individual payments of 4.1 million Taiwan dollars  (152,000 US) to relatives of the victims, regardless of nationality, but both  Taiwanese and Japanese relatives were reported to be planning to seek more.
Preliminary findings by the ministry showed that mechanical and human  errors were to blame for the crash.
