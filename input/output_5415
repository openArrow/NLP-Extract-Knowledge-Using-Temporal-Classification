"The larger-type ships ... aren't coming any more," Mazach said. "What  we're seeing is the smaller boats running the coastline."
The US Navy is beginning to deploy high-tech patrol boats called PCs or  Cyclones, which are built to move through shallow waters, and high speed rafts  to chase smaller boats closer to the coastline.
The blockade is controlled from the USS Wasp, an amphibious assault vessel  with 650 Marines aboard. It also carries 19 helicopters, a variety of high  tech transportation vehicles and medical facitilies.
