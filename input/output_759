Forty percent of Swedes remain opposed to their  country joining the European Union while 34 percent are in favour and 27  percent are undecided, according to results of a monthly poll by the SIFO  institute.
(The figures add up to 101 percent due to rounding.)
The poll results, carried Sunday in the daily Goeterborgs-Posten, shows a  two percent decrease in the number of those opposed to the union compared to  last month.
Those in favour also gained one percentage point this month and those  undecided jumped by two percent.
According to the poll, men are largely in favour of the EU with 42 percent  responding positively and 36 percent responding negatively. Swedish women, on  the other hand, remain heavily opposed to the union with 43 percent saying  they are against it and 26 percent saying they are in favour.
Sweden is to hold a referendum on the issue November 13, ahead of the  country's scheduled inclusion in the union in January 1995.
