Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone wants British  driver Nigell Mansell back in Grand Prix racing.
Ecclestone, the Formula One Constructors' Association president, has  reportedly talked to Mansell's IndyCar team owner Carl Haas.
He thinks Haas would not prevent Mansell driving in both the United States  and on the Grand Prix circuit.
That means Mansell could race as early as the French GP on July 3 and for  the five remaining races in Belgium, Portugal, Argentina, Japan and Australia.  He could not race in the British GP on July 10 as it clashes with an IndyCar  race.
However, the deal may yet fall through as Frank Williams was believed to  be so annoyed at the persistent speculation he had told test driver David  Coulthard he will get the drive if he does well in the Spanish GP on Sunday.
Williams has refused to comment on reports they have tried to lure  Mansell, world champion with them in 1992, back as a replacement for Brazilian  ace Ayrton Senna, who died in a crash at Imola earlier this month.
Williams, due to collect a 16 million pound (24 million dollar) insurance  payout for Senna's death, were reported to have made Mansell an offer of nine  million pounds (13.5 million dollars).
Williams were rebuffed when they approached Jordan for their Brazilian  driver Rubens Barrichello and Italian Riccardo Patrese and Briton Martin  Brundle turned them down.
But Ecclestone was said to be desperate for someone of Mansell's stature  to take on Benetton's German star Michael Schumacher, the runaway leader in  this year's championship.
