South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-Joo, now in Hanoi, was quoted by  Korean journalists travelling with him as saying it was "too early for  optimism or pessimism".
Han said however that he felt the possibility of a high-level  Washington-Pyongyang meeting going ahead was "high", should North Korea agree  with the IAEA on random selection and segregation of the rods for future  measurement.
The meeting would have been scuttled if the IAEA had found that refuelling  had gone beyond the critical stage and checking for diversion was no longer  possible, US officials have said.
A reporter from Yonhap news agency travelling with Han quoted "another  well-informed source" as saying the IAEA had "made a judgement call that saved  the two Koreas and the United States from going to the brink."
"The IAEA, instead of immediately charging North Korea with starting the  rod removal, has decided to go for substance," the Yonhap reporter said.
"It said North Korea's unloading process was still in an early stage and  the scope of the inspections the agency wants can still be achieved."
