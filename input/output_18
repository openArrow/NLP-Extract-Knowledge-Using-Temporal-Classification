Russian ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky said  Thursday he had approached Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin with a view to  his party being given places in the government, Interfax said.
The meeting came days after the entry into Chernomyrdin's team of  Democratic Party president Nikolai Travkin, a centrist generally opposed to  President Boris Yeltsin. Travkin did not receive a specific portfolio.
Zhirinovsky said he had spelled out three ways his party could receive  governmental positions, preferably those of defence and interior, along with  the counter-espionage portfolio. His Liberal Democratic Party also has its  sights on the posts of justice minister, as well as the treasury and the  ministry for privatisation.
"The head of the government now has to reflect," Zhirinovsky said. "And we  too are going to reflect on the position we are going to adopt in future  vis-a-vis the government."
Chernomyrdin's office did not comment on the nationalist leader's  statements.
Zhirinovsky has had the foreign ministry, the defence ministry and the  interior porfolio in his sights for the LDP since December's parliamentary  elections gave the party nearly 70 seats in the lower house of parliament.
He recently also demanded the resignation of six ministers.
