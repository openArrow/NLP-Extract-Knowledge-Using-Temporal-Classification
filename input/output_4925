Cambodian peace talks in Pyongyang ended "with  success" after supporting the idea of forming a standing committee to discuss  differences between the government and the Khmer Rouge, a press report said  Saturday.
The Korean Central News Agency, monitored here, said the roundtable  conference unanimously supported the "principles" of a ceasefire in Cambodia  and "defending the national and territorial unity of the country."
The talks also endorsed the principles of forming a standing committee  made up of all of Cambodia's factions "to discuss and solve the pending issues  between the Royal Government of Cambodia and the Democratic Cambodia side,"  the brief dispatch said.
In a speech at a banquet, hosted by North Korean President Kim Il-Sung,  Sihanouk thanked him for helping arrange the talks which began Friday in the  North Korean capital bringing together Cambodian leaders, KCNA said earlier.
King Sihanouk said the assistance had made it possible "for the leaders of  the state of Cambodia and the Democratic Cambodia side (Khmer Rouge) to  achieve positive results of unanimous support" to certain principles, the  official news agency said.
The king said the principles were "a ceasefire, though the date is yet to  be designated, defending the national and territorial unity of the country"  and forming a committe made up of all the groups to solve "one by one the  pending issues" between the government and Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
The peace talks, which had been expected to last until Monday, brought  together King Sihanouk, co-Premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen,  parliament chairman Chea Sim and Khmer Rouge nominal leader Khieu Samphan.
