Once dubbed India-No-Place because  nothing exciting ever happened here, this central US city is preparing for its  greatest weekend ever.
Along with the traditional excitement of pole qualifying for the  Indianapolis 500, the city plays host to a visit by US president Bill Clinton  and two sold-out National Basketball Association playoff games.
Add a Star Trek convention and sports memorabilia show to the mix and you  have the busiest event schedule here since the 1987 Pan American Games.
"It's quite a weekend," Indiana Pacers vice president Dale Raterman said.  "Sports fans here are excited. They've really caught the fever."
Indy 500 time trials begin Saturday, with more than 250,000 people  expected at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Qualifying continues Sunday as racers  attempt to fill the 33-car field for the May 29 race.
But adding to the excitement are the Indiana Pacers, who have advanced to  the second round of the NBA playoffs for the first time ever. They play  Atlanta here Saturday and Sunday afternoons in downtown Market Square Arena,  while the qualifying continues on the west side of town.
