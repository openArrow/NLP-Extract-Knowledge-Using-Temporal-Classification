More than half of residents in four  European Union countries fear criminals will prosper from the lifting of EU  border controls, a police poll released here Tuesday found.
Fifty-seven percent of 4,000 respondents from Belgium, France, Germany and  The Netherlands said they feared the open borders, due to be introduced at an  as yet unspecified time under the delayed Schengen accords, would lead to  increased crime, the survey found.
And 55 percent said they feared they could themselves become crime victims  as a result of the changes.
Carried out late last year by German police in this west German town and  their Dutch colleagues in Apeldoorn, the poll also found 92 percent favoured  the creation of a Europol, the EU police force which is to be based in The  Hague.
Eighty percent added they had nothing against their national police  questioning and arresting suspects in EU countries other than their own.
