An earthquake registering 6.8 on the Richter scale  Wednesday jolted the eastern Indonesian province of Irian Jaya, but no  casualties were reported, Antara news agency reported.
The epicentre of the quake, which struck at 1:03 p.m. (0403 GMT) was  33-450 kilometers (20-279 miles) beneath the Gulf of Cendrawasih, and 50  kilometres (31 miles) west of Nabire, the main town in north central Irian,  the Jakarta meteorological office said.
Antara reported a meteorological official in Nabir as saying that the  earthquake was recorded at 6.8 on the Richter scale in Nabire.
However, the meteorological office in Jakarta reported the temblor as 5.8  on the Richter scale, while in Australia, geologists said the quake measured  6.7 on the same scale.
An earthquake with a magnitude of six on the Richter scale can cause  severe damage.
Samders, the official in Nabire, said that the quake, the third this year  in the town, destroyed a school and several houses, but no casualties were  reported.
Keven McCue, the principal research scientist at the Australian Geological  Survey Organisation in Canberra, said, the light structure of homes in the  highly populated area would minimise casualties.
"The main problem is landslides," he said.
