A Chicago man who does not think executing serial  killer John Wayne Gacy sent enough of a message has spent about 20,000 dollars  on the murderer's paintings simply in order to burn them.
"We want them wiped off the map," said Joe Roth, a businessman who bought  more than two dozen of the 40 paintings auctioned off shortly before Tuesday's  execution.
Gacy, who was executed by lethal injection, was convicted in 1980 of  murdering 33 boys and young men during the 1970s.
Roth, 50, said the execution and the media coverage did not send a strong  enough message to warn parents to watch their children to prevent another Gacy  from striking again.
Roth said he would torch the works, depicting subjects ranging from Mickey  Mouse to Jesus, within 30 days.
He said he was disappointed he could not buy Gacy's entire oeuvre. "It's  too bad we couldn't have wiped them all off the map."
Others among the 200 people at the auction got there first, some of them  paying as much as 800 dollars for a painting, auction organizers said.
Some of the auction's proceeds will go to the families of Gacy's victims.
