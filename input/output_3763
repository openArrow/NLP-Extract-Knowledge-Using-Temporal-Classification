Three men convicted of beating  and kicking a pre-med Vietnamese-American student to death at a party in 1992  could go to prison for life when they are sentenced in a month, prosecutors  said.
Christopher Anderson, 20, Terry Jamerson, 22, and William Madalone, 23,  were convicted Tuesday of second-degree murder in the killing of Luyen Phan  Nguyen.
Sentencing has been scheduled for June 28.
In October 1992, Bradley Mills, 20, was convicted and sentenced to 50  years in prison in the same case, and two other defendants are scheduled to be  tried on murder charges in June 20.
Nguyen, who was attending the University of Miami, was at a party in Coral  Springs, Florida, on August 15, 1992, when he objected to being taunted and  called racist names by other guests.
Prosecutors said Nguyen was first slapped by Anderson, then was either  punched or pushed in the chest by Jamerson before several other youths set  upon him beating him severely. He died two days later in hospital.
Anderson's lawyer said his client was guilty only of slapping Nguyen.
"And you can call that slap stupid... dumb... an idiotic and foolish act  of machismo of a drunk. But you can't call that slap murder in the second  degree."
Defense lawyers for the three youths said they will appeal the veredicts.
