New Zealand next week will produce genetic  testing information that scientists here say will prove Japan is selling meat  from protected species of whale.
The evidence will be produced at the International Whaling Commission's  (IWC) annual meeting in Mexico next week.
"It's going to be a little timebomb,'' David Taylor, deputy director of  the foreign ministry's environment division, said Friday.
"It's going to make the Japanese see red, and the Norwegians as well."
The evidence from Auckland scientist Scott Baker was first presented to a  meeting of the IWC's scientific committee two weeks ago, he said.
Using a new DNA-based technique, Baker tested meat samples in a Japanese  hotel room. The results showed that humpback and fin whale meat is being sold.
The Japanese only have a scientific permit from the IWC to take a quota of  minke whales.
Humpback whales have not been legally hunted since 1966, while fin whale  was last hunted legally under an Icelandic scientific permit in 1989.
The Japanese are selling all species as kujira, the generic name for  whalemeat.
"New Zealand is keen to make the most of this new technology in terms of  the protection and policing of whales," Taylor said from Mexico City where he  is with the New Zealand delegation.
Conservation Department principal marine mammals officer Mike Donoghue  said the technique had potential for international wildlife management.
"Now we have a technique which means we can go into a supermarket and test  whale meat in Japan, or for tigers in China."
"It will serve to put (illegal traders) on alert that any greenie could go  into their country and do it," he said.
