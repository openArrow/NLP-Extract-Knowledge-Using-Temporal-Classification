Germany's eighth largest bank, Bayerische  Landesbank Girozentrale (BLG), was granted a licence to operate here as part  of its move to widen services to Asia-Pacific, a government spokesman said  Friday.
The bank, which ranks 84th in the world in terms of capital, became the  sixth foreign bank this year to be granted a licence in Hong Kong, which is to  revert to China in 1997.
BLG said it wished to upgrade its representative office to a full branch  to provide a wider range of banking services to its customers in Hong Kong,  China, Taiwan, Australia, and New Zealand.
It will initially concentrate on project financing and corporate lending,  before offering commercial and merchant banking services later.
The government spokesman said that "the continuing interest of foreign  banks in entering the local market reflects Hong Kong's continued importance  and attractiveness as a major international financial centre."
There are now 178 licensed banks in Hong Kong, of which 146 were  incorporated outside the territory.
