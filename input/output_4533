Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. announced Friday a pre-tax  loss of 44.1 billion yen (428 million dollars) for the year to March and  forecast another two years of losses including 33 billion yen this year.
The troubled Hiroshima-based carmaker, which posted a profit of 6.2  billion yen a year earlier, also cut its year-end dividend, blaming the loss  on a 19.3 percent plunge in sales to 1,769 billion yen as well as the stronger  yen.
Mazda president Yoshihiro Wada said the loss defied efforts to strengthen  and streamline operations and signalled three consecutive years of losses,  saying the company aimed to return to the black by the year ending March 1997.
"Considering the continuing severe operating environment, Mazda will  accelerate its efforts to improve Mazda's financial financial strength in  order to achieve profitability even during period of slow market growth," he  said.
Mazda, which is 24.5 percent-owned by Ford Motor Co. of the United States,  said overall sales were expected to recover to 1,840 billion yen this year  despite the projection for continued losses.
In the latest year, export revenue plummetted 21.2 percent to to 1,068  billion yen while domestic revenue fell 16.1 percent to 701 billion yen.
Overall sales of motor vehicles alone dropped 22.4 percent from a year  earlier to 1,187 billion yen and sales of parts and components for overeas  production were down 15.9 percent at 156 billion yen.
Mazda sales volumes sagged 20 percent to 1,008,992 units, depressed by a  23.2 percent slump in exports to 614,038 units. Domestic sales were down 14.5  percent at 394,954 units. Overall car sales dropped 17.5 percent to 837,700  units and sales of commercial vehicles tumbled 30.6 percent to 171,292 units.
