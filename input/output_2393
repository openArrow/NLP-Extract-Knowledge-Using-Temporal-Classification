The Vietnamese government Friday probed a  Kuala Lumpur report that 33 Thai and three Malaysian fishermen were taken  hostage by pirates in Vietnam who have threatened to blow up their boat if a  ransom was not paid.
"Our authorities in Hanoi are investigating the matter but we cannot say  they are Vietnamese pirates because we don't know at which point the fishermen  were allegedly detained," Bui Van Khao, a Vietnamese embassy spokesman said.
The Utusan Malaysia, a national Malay daily, said in a front-page report  that the pirates held the fishermen on May 5 when they were fishing in  Malaysian waters and demanded a ransom of 110,000 ringgit (44,000 US dollars).
All the fishermen, including the Thais who held permits to work in  Malaysia, were based in northeastern Terengganu state, the report said.
The fishermen were being held on an island called Cemau in southern  Vietnam, the report said, adding that they were forced to move their vessel  into Vietnamese waters.
Malaysia's fisheries department had said recently that local fishermen  were facing increasing threats from armed foreign vessels.
