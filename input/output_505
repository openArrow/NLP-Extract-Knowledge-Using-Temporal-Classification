Record-breaking Michael Schumacher overcame his  fears to push himself to the limit here on Saturday and grab pole position for  the Monaco Grand Prix.
But the race is still sure to be overshadowed by Thursday's crash  involving Karl Wendlinger.
The Austrian is in a deep coma, the latest nightmare faced by Formula One  after the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at the San Marino  Grand Prix two weeks ago.
Schumacher, who has won all three races this season, stamped his authority  on Saturday's final official practice in the Benetton-Ford, clocking a record  1min 18.560secs to beat Nigel Mansell's best of 1:19.495, set here two years  ago.
The German, averaging 152km/h, was nearly a second faster than Finland's  Mika Hakkinen, at the wheel of the McLaren-Peugeot.
Schumacher said: "I was totally confident in the car and I pushed myself  to the limit -- despite the recent events, I did not have any problems  concentrating.
"I haven't worked out my race strategy yet but I'm very confident."
Gerhard Berger, who has done much to mobilise drivers over safety in the  last fortnight, and will be a leading figure in the newly-formed Grand Prix  Drivers Association, set the third best time in a Ferrari.
Out of respect for Senna and Ratzenberger, the drivers were set to leave  the front row clear on Sunday, starting a line further back.
The late Senna's teammate at Williams-Renault, Damon Hill, will start on  the second row of cars alongside Berger, whose French teammate Jean Alesi will  start on the third with Brazil's Christian Fittipaldi in the Footwork Ford.
Hugely talented and driving the best car in the championship, Schumacher  now has no serious rival for the crown in the wake of Senna's death.
McLaren-Peugeot and Ferrari are also likely to win races this season, as  could Hill but there is little doubt that Benetton-Ford will get the top prize.
