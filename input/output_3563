Two Russian reporters who disappeared in Croatia in  1991 were killed by Serb soldiers, but Russia at the time refused to  investigate the case so as not to jeopordize its relations with Belgrade,  according to an article published in the daily Izvestia Tuesday.
The article is based on a report of a three-year investigation by Vladimir  Mukusyev, who headed a parliamentary probe into the reporters' disappearance  in 1991 and who dismissed the official version of events blaming the Croats  for the incident.
Mukusyev's report states that a Serb soldier witnessed the assassination  of Viktor Nogin and Gennady Kurennoy, both of whom worked for what was then  Soviet television.
The witness said the two men were ambushed as they were returing from the  Croatian battle front and were later executed upon orders from separatist Serb  officials in Croatia's Krajina region.
The witness himself was killed after relating the incident to Russian  diplomats in Belgrade, Izvestia said.
The reporters' disappearance prompted then Soviet president Mikhail  Gorbachev and the London-based International Press Institute to try and  intervene on their behalf.
