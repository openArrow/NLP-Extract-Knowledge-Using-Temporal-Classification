A controversial black Islamic leader  and at least one other other person were shot Sunday following a speech on a  California campus, authorities said.
Khallid Muhammad was not seriously injured according to police, who had to  pull the crowd off the gunman after the shooting in the University of  California, Riverside, parking lot.
Muhammad, 43, was suspended from his duties as a senior aide to Nation of  Islam's chief Louis Farrakhan after a speech in November in which he called  Jews "the bloodsuckers of the black nation and the black community."
In his speech in the south-central area of Los Angeles -- the site of the  1991 riots -- Muhammad warned the handful of white listeners his speech would  be "a rough ride" and proceeded again to attack Jews.
"The black holocaust is 100 times worse than any other holocaust ever  recorded in the annals of time," he said, adding that the Jews had infiltrated  the civil rights movement to pursue their own interests.
Farrakhan has denounced Muhammad as an anti-semite, as has President Bill  Clinton and Jewish leaders.
