The US communications giant ITT  announced plans Thursday for a 750 million dollar hotel and casino in Las  Vegas.
"Desert Kingdom," which is to be completed by early 1997, will cover more  than 13 hectares (32 acres) with its huge casino and 2,500-room hotel.
Construction on the complex will begin this year using the latest  water-conservation technology and labor costs alone are estimated to reach  some 500,000 dollars a day. Once completed, the casino will employ about 5,000  workers.
The project, which will be financed through bond issues, follows the  massive 2,500 room "Luxor" hotel-casino which opened last year in Las Vegas to  the tune of 300 million dollars.
ITT owns the Sheraton hotel chain, which company president Kapioltas said  received 140,000 requests for lodging in Las Vegas this year that it could not  meet.
ITT Sheraton has 400 hotels in 61 countries. Its revenues last year  reached 3.2 billion dollars. ITT posted 23 billion dollars in revenues for  1993 and profits were up 28 percent to 219 million dollars for the first  quarter of this year.
