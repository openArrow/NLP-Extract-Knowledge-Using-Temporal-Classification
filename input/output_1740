A sixth youth has been charged in  connection with an attack by skinheads on a group of Africans in this eastern  German town, the state prosecutor said Wednesday.
Four of those charged are in custody, while the other two are still at  large, the prosecutor added. He said investigations were under way regarding  30 other suspects.
The roles of both the police and the judiciary came under fire, meanwhile,  from deputies in the lower house of the federal parliament in a debate on last  Thursday's violence, when some 50 skinheads attacked a group of Africans and  chased them through the town.
Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger admitted the police  had made "mistakes," and said they could have contained the violence had they  intervened more rapidly.
She said she believed existing legislation was sufficient to cope with the  problem and called for those laws to be applied strictly.
Konrad Weiss of the opposition Alliance 90-Green coalition said that  passers-by who had tried to intervene to stop the neo-fascists appeared to  have been hampered by police.
Juergen Schmude of the main opposition Social Democratic Party said the  attacks on foreigners had to stop.
Several MPs said it was "incomprehensible" that police had quickly  released some 50 people arrested after the attack.
