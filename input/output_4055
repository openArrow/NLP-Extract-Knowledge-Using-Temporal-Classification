Plenty of people have died behind a  car's steering wheel in the United States, but few have been buried behind it  like George Swanson was Wednesday.
After protracted discussions with cemetery officials, Swanson finally got  his burial wish when workers lowered his Corvette sports car into its grave  with Swanson's ashes resting in the driver's seat.
"George always said he lived a fabulous life, and he went out in a  fabulous style," said his widow, Caroline Swanson.
George Swanson died March 31 at age 71. Prior to his death, the beer  distributor had set up elaborate burial plans for himself, buying 12 graves to  accomodate the 1984 Chevrolet Corvette.
Cemetery officials had blocked the burial for several weeks. They feared  the event would generate vandalism and offend other clients.
The authorities relented, provided the burial was private and that all the  car's fluids were drained to prevent environmental damage.
With the go ahead, Swanson was once again surrounded by the things he  loved. His wife drove his ashes to the funeral in her 1993 Corvette. She  placed his urn in the '84 Corvette accompanied by some of his favorite  mementos.
In the stereo sat an Englebert Humperdinck tape queued to Swanson's  favorite song "Release Me."
He had two driving caps, a love letter from his wife, and a lap quilt sewn  by the women of his church put into the Corvette. The car even retained his  trade-mark license plate with the words "HI PAL". It was the greeting he used  when he could not remember someone's name.
"You have a lot of people saying they want to take it with them. He took  it with him," said his widow.
Cemetery workers took the event in stride. "You can't think of this as a  car," said caretaker Robert Miller. "It's like a big fiberglass vault. It's  just extra work, just a bigger grave to fill," he added.
