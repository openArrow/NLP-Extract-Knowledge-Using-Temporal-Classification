South Africa has formally applied for  membership of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), SABC public radio said  Friday, quoting OAU secretary Salim Ahmed Salim.
Salim said he had been contacted by South Africa's new foreign minister,  Alfed Nzo, who had told him that his country wanted to join the OAU.
South Africa's membership application is expected to be approved  officially at the start of the OAU heads of state summit meeting in Tunis on  June 13, to which President Nelson Mandela has been invited.
In terms of Article 28 of the OAU Charter, the organisation's 51 member  states must support South Africa's application with a simple majority for it  to go ahead.
Other items on the agenda are expected to include the OAU's quest to set  up an African economic community
The OAU was formed in Addis Ababba on 26 May 1963 by 30 independent  African states.
It now consists of every African state, apart from South Africa, which was  excluded because of it's previous government's apartheid policies, and  Morocco, which left the organisation in the 1980s over a conflict with  Mauritania and Togo.
