A joint Palestinian-Israeli  patrol stopped extremists from the banned racist Kach movement from praying in  Jericho's synagogue overnight, Israeli military sources said Saturday.
The Kach members tried to slip into the Shalom al Israel synagogue under  cover of darkness across fields around the building.
But the joint patrol, which included Palestinian police who only took up  their new duties on Friday, discovered the ploy and stopped the group outside  the synagogue.
The group then obeyed the patrol's orders to leave.
Kach was banned by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shortly after the  February 25 Hebron mosque massacre in which a Jewish settler killed 30 Arab  worshippers.
It was the second time that Israelis had tried to get into the synagogue  since the army withdrew from the West Bank town of Jericho on Friday  transferring powers to the Palestinians. Jewish settlers from Ofra, north of  the town, have also tried to enter.
Under the Israel-PLO self-rule deal signed on May 4 in Cairo, the  synagogue is to be administered by the Palestinians in coordination with the  Israeli ministry for religious affairs.
