The cancer that took Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis'  life late Thursday in New York is one of the fastest-growing malignancies in  the United States, although the cause for its rise is unclear.
Non-Hogkin's lymphoma, which is in fact a term used for a variety of lymph  node malignancies, is also among the most curable forms of cancer, according  to medical experts.
"It is one of the most treatable of all human cancers," said Dr. Bruce  Cheson of the National Cancer Institute. "Some forms, even though treatable,  are incurable. Other forms that are more aggressive are also quite curable, if  treated appropriately."
Over the past three decades, the United States has seen a 60 percent rise  in non-Hogkin's lymphoma, more than all cancers but a few such as melanoma. It  most frequently strikes people in their 50s.
Overall, however, its incidence is far lower than cancers of the lung,  breast and colon, which are the deadliest forms of cancer.
People suffering from AIDS or given drugs to prevent rejection of  tranplanted organs are highly susceptible to the malignancy, but scientists  say this does not account for the entire increase.
Some researchers say pesticides or hair dyes may be linked to non-Hogkin's  lymphoma, but the evidence is far from certain.
The malignancy differs from Hodgkin's disease, another lymph node cancer,  by the structure and organization of the cancer cells.
Patients with non-Hodgkins lymphoma often respond well to chemotherapy,  although the disease usually recurs in a number of years. In some cases, the  cancer can spread quickly and be fatal within weeks.
Some patients with an aggressive form of the cancer are cured with bone  marrow transplants, although this too is not always effective.
