Defense Secretary William Perry's scheduled  visit to Panama this week has been postponed, the Pentagon announced without  giving any reason for the delay.
A new date for the visit will be announced next week, the Pentagon said  Monday in a statement.
Perry is expected to meet in Panama with US Southern Command leader  General Barry McCaffrey, and visit US military installations still home to  10,000 US troops.
The United States has been steadily reducing its military presence in  Panama from 26,000 troops in late 1989, when it intervened to remove General  Manuel Antonio Noriega, the country's strongman whose dealings with  international drug-traffickers led him to be tried, convicted and sentenced to  40 years in jail in Miami, Florida.
Under the terms of the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty, the US military will pull  out altogether from the isthmus by the December 31, 1999, when the canal will  be formally transferred to Panama.
Some 6,000 US troops and their families are scheduled to be withdrawn from  Panama by the end of next year.
