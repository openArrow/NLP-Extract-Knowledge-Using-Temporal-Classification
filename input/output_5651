French Defence Minister Francois Leotard was cleared  of corruption on Tuesday in the case of a 250,000 franc (41,000 dollars) wall  he had built at his home at Frejus, on the French Riviera.
An appeal court here ruled there was no case to answer and that a judicial  probe had failed to turn up sufficient evidence of passive corruption against  the minister.
Leotard, who is major of Frejus, was first indicted in June, 1992 for  influence peddling and corruption in acquiring his 800 square metre (yard)  home set in grounds of 2.5 hectares (7.5 acres).
Leotard, who became defence minister in April 1993, was accused of paying  for the property at far below the market price, after a Frejus builder, Rene  Espanol, alleged that the mayor was putting business the way of a competitor,  who had sold the property to Leotard.
The Lyon court ruled in February, 1993 that there was no case to answer  because the charges were covered by the statute of limitations, but ordered a  continued probe into the affair of the wall.
The wall, separating Leotard's property from a public park, was built by a  firm called SEDEG which waived its bill and subsequently obtained a municipal  contract.
On Tuesday, the court said in its ruling that Leotard eventually paid the  41,000 dollars and that SEDEG won its municipal contract in regular  circumstances, by submitting the lowest tender.
