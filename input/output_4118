Foreign corporate leaders rate Tokyo at the bottom  of leading cities for quality of life and the working environment, according  to a survey published Thursday that was commissioned by the city authorities.
New York, London and Berlin all rated higher on these counts, according to  the poll of 478 foreign-owned firms published in the daily Asahi.
The executives complained of astronmical rents for decent housing and  consumer prices that caused them to pay huge living allowances to expatriate  employees. As a result they had been obliged to cut back on the number of  expatriate workers.
But they also cited a jungle of regulations and government bureaucracy  that hampered them from obtaining trading licences and work permits.
However, Tokyo rated second to New York in terms of the size of its market  and information availability, and topped the list for safety and the image  that a company could project by setting up in the Japanese capital.
The Japanese Association of Real-Estate Appraisal last week reported that  Tokyo was still the most expensive city in the world for offices and housing.
Monthly office rent in Tokyo is around 160,000 yen (1,524 dollars) per  square metre (14,900 yen, or 141 dollars, per square foot) -- 3.4 times more  expensive than in New York.
