The Canadian firm Canoxy has suspended  operations in the Masila oilfield because of Yemen's civil war, Western  sources in this southern port city said Monday.
They said tankers had stopped loading from the southeastern Mukalla  terminal to where the Masila crude arrives by pipeline, because of higher  insurance premiums.
Around 20 Canadians were evacuated Monday from Mukalla, 700 kilometres  (420 miles) east of Aden.
However, Yemen's oil facilities in the south have not been damaged by the  fighting since May 5 between rival northern and southern army units, the  sources said.
Canoxy has operated in Yemen for the last five years. Masila produces  nearly 120,000 barrels of oil per day.
