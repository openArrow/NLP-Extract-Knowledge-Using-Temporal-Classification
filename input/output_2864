Australia came back from a goal down to  draw 1-1 with Japan in the opening match of the three-team Kirin Cup  tournament here on Sunday.
The new-look Japanese side, playing their first game under new Brazilian  coach Falcao, took an early lead when Tetsuya Asano flicked in on a free kick  in the sixth minute.
Australia finally equalised in the 68th minute. Midfielder Aurelio Vidmar  was set free by a long through ball.
Defender Yoshihiro Natsuka blocked his shot, but Carl Vert headed back the  rebound for Vidmar to score from close range in the 68th minute.
Japan had three free-kicks in the last 10 minutes, but striker Kazuyoshi  Miura wasted each chance.
Australia, last-minute entrants after Argentina withdrew in protest at  Japan's refusal to give a visa to Diego Maradona, play France in Kobe in their  second match on Thursday.
