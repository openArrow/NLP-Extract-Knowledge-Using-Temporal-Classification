US Secretary of State Warren Christopher said  Saturday on the eve of a visit to Damascus there was still a long way to go to  forge a peace deal between arch enemies Israel and Syria.
Christopher, in Switzerland for talks on the former Yugoslavia, leaves for  Damascus Sunday, on a shuttle between Syria and Israel set to end on May 19.
He will be in Jerusalem Monday to "help parties move closer together," he  said, adding he could not rule out another visit to the Syrian capital.
"It's a long process," he said. "I do think the parties are serious and I  want to play my part and take the messages back and forth."
But he added, during a meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Mussa:  "I don't have any great ambitions for this particular trip."
On his last visit to the region in April Christopher conveyed Israeli  proposals for a phased withdrawal from the disputed Golan Heights to Syrian  President Hafez al-Assad.
The strategic heights occupied by Israel in 1967 and annexed in 1981 have  remained the main stumbling block to resuming direct peace talks between  Israel and Syria.
Commenting on the Golan Heights issue, Mussa said: "The parties are ready  to move forward. We are ready to help whenever our help is needed or required  but we don't impose ourselves."
Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin said Friday in an interview  with the US television news network CNN he thought Israel and Syria could make  peace within the coming months.
But Syria has remained sceptical about Christopher's forthcoming visit.  One official charged that Israel had reduced the US role to "a mere postman  delivering the Israeli point of view without any amendment."
US officials have also played down Christopher's shuttle mission.
"The one certainty is that there will be a lot of trips ... It will be a  long and arduous process," an official warned.
