Mazda Motor Corp. announced a pre-tax loss of 44.1  billion yen (428 million dollars) and its bigger rival Mitsubishi Motors Corp.  said group earnings were more than halved to 21.3 billion yen, on Friday.
Daihatsu Motor Corp. Ltd., a minicar maker affiliated with Toyota Motor  Corp., meanwhile reversed its losses with a pre-tax profit of 2.4 billion yen,  saying the return to the black reflected cost-cutting efforts.
Mazda, which forecast another two years of losses including 33 billion yen  this year, also cut its year-end dividend, blaming the loss on a 19.3 percent  plunge in sales to 1,769 billion yen as well as the stronger yen. The troubled  Hiroshima-based carmaker posted a profit of 6.2 billion yen a year earlier.
President Yoshihiro Wada said the loss defied efforts to strengthen and  streamline operations and signalled three consecutive years of losses, saying  the company aimed to return to the black by the year ending March 1997.
"Considering the continuing severe operating environment, Mazda will  accelerate its efforts to improve Mazda's financial strength in order to  achieve profitability even during periods of slow market growth," he said.
Mazda, which is 24.5 percent-owned by Ford Motor Co. of the United States,  said overall sales were expected to recover to 1,840 billion yen this year  despite the projection for continued losses.
In the latest year, export revenue fell by 21.2 percent to 1,068 billion  yen while domestic revenue fell 16.1 percent to 701 billion yen.
Overall sales of motor vehicles alone fell by 22.4 percent from the figure  a year earlier to 1,187 billion yen and sales of parts and components for  overeas production were down 15.9 percent at 156 billion yen.
Mazda sales volumes sagged 20 percent to 1,008,992 units, depressed by a  23.2 percent slump in exports to 614,038 units. Domestic sales were down 14.5  percent at 394,954 units. Overall car sales fell by 17.5 percent to 837,700    units and sales of commercial vehicles tumbled 30.6 percent to 171,292 units.
Mitsubishi said its group pre-tax earnings plunged 57.7 percent from a  year earlier to 21.3 billion yen. Suffering from a slump in exports as a  result of the stronger yen, it said worldwide sales fell 7.3 percent to 2,947  billion yen with operating profit dropping 47.1 percent to 40.8 billion yen.
The company, which gave no group forecast for the current year, projected  lower parent company earnings of 13 billion following a 24.1 percent decline  to 35.4 billion yen in the latest year. But parent sales were forecast to  increase to 2,520 billion yen after falling 6.1 percent to 2,456 billion yen.
Domestic car sales fell three percent to 722,000 units in the year to  March while exports dropped 11 percent to 590,000 units.
Mitsubishi forecast higher domestic sales of 770,000 units in the current  year with exports declining further to 560,000. Overseas output was forecast  to jump to 595,000 units this year after rising 17 percent to 523,000 units.
Daihatsu's return to the black followed a 4.4 billion yen loss a year  earlier and was accompanied by a higher profit forecast for this year. Sales,  adversely affected by the stronger yen, fell 6.8 percent to 731 billion yen.
The company forecast higher earings of four billion yen in the current  year with revenue edging down to 730 billion yen.
