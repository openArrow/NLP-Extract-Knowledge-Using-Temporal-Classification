Seconds after Edberg's defeat, 12th seeded Petr Korda, the runner-up two  years ago, also went out in a five-set thriller after leading Italy's  promising Andrea Gaudenzi two sets to one.
Elsewhere the favourites came safely home. Defending champion Sergi  Bruguera and the man he beat in last year's final Jim Courier, both survived  their first round matches.
The sixth-seeded Bruguera looked as though he was about to take up where  he left off last year with a fine exhibition of clay-court tennis but after  racing 6-1, 6-1, 5-1 clear after one and a half hours on the centre-court  against Czech opponent Martin Damm, things suddenly went badly wrong.
The 23-year-old Spaniard, who hasn't won a tournament in 1994, found  himself forced into a tie-break -- which he managed to clinch 7-3.
"It was a sticky finish," he admitted. "I thought I'd won and I relaxed  and stopped moving my legs. He played a couple of good matches and got back  into the match."
Courier was unruffled by the non-stop screaming of a female spectator, who  was eventually escorted out by officials, as he eliminated 71st-ranked  Frenchman Jean-Philippe Felurian 6-1, 6-4, 6-4.
"I think she must have been a bit schizophrenic," Courier laughed  afterwards. "Whatever she was shouting she kept changing from Jean to Jim."
Veteran Ivan Lendl, 34 and a three-times champion, went out in  straight-sets against home hope Arnaud Boetsch while other names from the  past, Tracy Austin and Pam Shriver were also eliminated. Neither won a set.
Garrison, the 14th seed, went down to Silke Frankl of Germany in three  sets 6-3, 4-6, 6-2.
