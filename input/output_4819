The chief prosecutor in the  self-proclaimed republic of Dniestr was seriously injured and his wife killed  in a bomb attack, city officials said here Friday.
The explosion, which occurred Thursday as the couple walked into an  elevator, also seriously injured the bodyguards protecting prosecutor Boris  Luchik, two city councillors said.
His wife died at the scene. The prosecutor and his two bodyguards were  under surveillance in hospital Friday. No motive for the attack was  immediately available.
Dniestr, a mainly-Russian region in eastern Moldova, proclaimed itself a  republic in 1992 after taking up arms against government forces over the  threat of Moldova uniting with Romania. Hundreds of people died in subsequent  months of fighting.
