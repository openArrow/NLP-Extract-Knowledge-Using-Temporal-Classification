Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama called  Saturday during a visit to Russia, for a referendum to decide the future of  Tibet, ITAR-TASS news agency said in a report monitored here by the BBC.
The Dalai Lama said in an interview with the Moscow-based news agency that  he would "find ways and means to hold a referendum on the future of Tibet"  which Beijing now considers part of China.
The Dalai Lama said he "remains hopeful" of returning to his homeland  which he left to go into exile in 1959 when Chinese troops occupied the  country.
Tibetan culture "is on the verge of extinction", said the Dalai Lama who  has criticised the mass settlement of ethnic Chinese in Tibet.
He said he was ready to hold talks with China on the basis of the "one  country two systems" principle - the formula under which Hong Kong is to be  returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
The Dalai Lama has spent three days in Russia as guest of the Russian  Academy of Sciences and the Moscow-based International Foundation for the  Survival and Development of Humanity.
He said he had been impressed by the changes in Russia and greater  openness of Russian society.
