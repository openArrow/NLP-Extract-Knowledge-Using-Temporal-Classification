Graf admitted: "I always ask to play as early as possible to get into the  feel of things. It was a good first match for me.
"I tried to come in a bit more than usual and consequently I made a few  extra errors. But I'm feeling good."
Graf, who always enjoys Grand Slam events, said she hoped to be able to  persuade her coach, former Swiss player Heinz Gunthardt, to enter the mixed  doubles with her.
The German player paid a warm tribute to Martina Navratilova who is making  her last appearance at the Championships.
"She will be missed very badly. There will be a big gap when she goes,"  said Graf. "She has done so much for tennis and I have always loved playing  against her."
Navratilova, 37 and twice a winner here, is scheduled to launch her  twelfth and final campaign on her least preferred surface later today.
The main shock of the morning came when Boris Becker, the tenth seed, was  forced to withdraw after straining a back muscle while training.
Hoping to win the only major title that has always eluded him, the  three-times Wimbledon champion had been scheduled to play American Jonathan  Stark.
His place in the draw was taken by lucky-loser Brent Larkham of Australia.
