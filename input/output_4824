US-Canadian negotiations have failed to resolve  disputes over a plan to protect Pacific salmon, prompting Canada to begin work  on its own program, Canadian Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin said here Friday.
Tobin said that talks were hampered by conflicting interests of US states  involved in the matter -- Alaska, Washington and Oregon.
He added that Canada would begin drafting its own plan for preserving  salmon in British Colombian waters.
"The United States are not united on salmon," Tobin said after meeting  with US officials. "If there is a fish war it is between the states."
Tobin said leaders from Oregon and Washington want Canada to catch fewer  salmon from the Colombia River, while Alaska has resisted efforts to limit  salmon catches from Canadian waters.
According to Canadian officials, US fishermen catch six million more  salmon of Canadian origin than the number of US salmon caught by Canadians.
"It is very clear to us there is not a basis for negotiation," he said.
Canada's delegation said further talks could be held if Washington put  forth a serious proposal.
