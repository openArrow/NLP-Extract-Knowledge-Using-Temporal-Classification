Japan's Ricoh Co. Ltd said Friday its consolidated  pre-tax earnings jumped 51 percent from a year earlier to 25.6 billion yen  (249 million dollars) in the year to March.
But the leading manufacturer of office equipment said worldwide sales  declined five percent to 968 billion yen in the same period, attributing the  sharply higher profit to improved margins.
Ricoh forecast an even higher group profit of 33 billion yen for the  current year with sales recovering to the 1,030 billion yen level.
