The representative of Lebanon's Shiite Moslem  community urged the American and Russian co-sponsors of the Middle East peace  talks to condemn Israel's abduction of a fundamentalist guerrilla chief.
"If they want to achieve what they call peace in the Middle East, they  must adopt a just position on this operation" to kidnap Resistance of the  Faithful leader Mustafa Dirani, Sheikh Mohammad Mehdi Shamseddin said.
Speaking at the Dirani's home in Qsarnaba, Syrian-controlled eastern  Lebanon, Shamseddin said: "It is not in the interest of those who call  themselves the co-sponsors of the peace process not to condemn Israel.
"Israel has unmasked them and made liars out of them," the president of  the Higher Shiite Council told relatives and friends of the abducted leader of  the pro-Iranian group.
An airborne Israeli commando snatched Dirani from his home on Saturday to  question him about missing airman Ron Arad, whose plane was shot down over  south Lebanon in 1986 during an Israeli bombing raid.
Israel praised itself over the operation and Prime Minister Shimon Peres  said "it shows that our army has a long reach and can do the impossible to  retrieve our missing."
But Shamseddin said Israel should not brag about the operation.
"Others, too, have a long reach but they are not acting out of respect for  international law, the peace process and moral values," Shamseddin said.
He added however that Dirani's abduction "will not affect the wish to  resist against Israeli occupation" of south Lebanon.
Anti-Israeli groups spearheaded by the powerful Hezbollah movement have  vowed to retaliate against Israel.
Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah told a Beirut press  conference on Tuesday the response will come from where the Israelis "expect  and where they don't expect."
