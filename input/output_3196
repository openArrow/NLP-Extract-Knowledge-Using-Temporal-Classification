Four major undersea earthquakes measuring from 4.6  to 5.8 on the open-ended Richter scale rocked Taiwan on Monday, but no damage  or casualties were immediately reported, the Central Weather Bureau said.
The tremors which took place between 12:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. (0400 GMT  and 0800 GMT) were followed by more than 60 minor quakes, Chien Wen-feng,  chief of the earthquake section of the bureau, said.
"The earthquake belt in eastern Taiwan has not had any activity for some  time," Chien said. "The quakes in the afternoon were normal."
The strongest temblor struck at at 1:36 p.m. (0536 GMT) and lasted for  some 50 seconds, bureau officials said, adding that it shook high-rise  buildings across the island.
Its epicenter was located 110.4 kilometers (68.6 miles) east of Hualien in  eastern Taiwan and at 7.2 kilometers (4.5 miles) in depth, they said.
Taiwan is situated on a earthquake belt, but most tremors are centered  under the surrounding sea, which tones down their destructive strength.
Earthquakes of magnitude six on the Richter scale are capable of causing  severe damage in a populated area, while one registering seven is considered a  major tremor capable of widespread, heavy damage.
