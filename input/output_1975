At least 20 people were killed and 30 wounded in the  Afghan capital Thursday, when a rocket hit a crowded checkpoint controlled by  Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami forces, witnesses said.
The rocket struck as scores of people gathered at the checkpoint in the  Chelsitoon area in south Kabul, waiting to stock up with supplies in the  Hezb-held part of the city, ahead of this weekend's Moslem Eid festival.
Locals said the rocket was fired from a hill controlled by troops loyal to  Hekmatyar's rival, President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
Scores of people had rushed to the checkpoint following an announcement on  Hezb radio that a blockade of routes to the centre of the capital had been  lifted  because of the religious festivities.
"I decided to shop at Chelsitoon in the hope of getting essentials for our  family at cheaper rates and look what's happend to me," cried a 35-year old  woman, who lost one leg.
Meanwhile, fighting was reported around Maidan Shahr, a city about 30  kilometers west of here, in the Wardak province.
The defence ministry said Wednesday that pro-Rabbani forces had overrun  the city, but the claim was denied by the Hezb-i-Islami.
A fighter from Ittihad-i-Islami faction, which is allied to Rabbani, said:  "Our forces hold the key hills around Maidan Shahr."
The man, who was undergoing hospital treatment here, said he arrived from  Maidan Shahr area Thursday after being wounded in the fighting.
"We got orders to withdraw from the city, even though we had captured it  in a very easy fight," he said.
The International Commitee of the Red Cross said in April that 2,500  poeple had been killed and 17,000 injured in the fighting between the forces  of Rabbani and the combined troops of Hezb and Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid  Dostam, since the beginning of January.
