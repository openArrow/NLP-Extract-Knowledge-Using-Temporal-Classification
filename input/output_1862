Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was released from  hospital here Wednesday after treatment for complications of her cancer.
The 64-year-old widow of slain US president John F. Kennedy and Greek  shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis checked in Monday "as a result of serious  complications of her malignant lymphoma," New York Hospital-Cornell Medical  Center said in a statement.
"While in the hospital, she received further diagnostic evaluation and  treatment."
Onassis revealed in February that she has non-Hodgkins lymphoma. The  former first lady also received surgery for a bleeding ulcer in April.
