Twenty-five Kurdish rebels and five Turkish troops  have died in the latest wave of violence in the southeast of the country,  officials said here Tuesday.
The clashes, since early Monday, were between separatists and army forces  at Erzincan, where 18 rebels and four soldiers were killed, and at Siirt and  Diyarbakir, where seven Kurds and one soldier died.
They came at the end of a month in which at least 500 rebels of the  Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) died, according to official figures.
Since mid-March Turkish forces have stepped up their efforts in the east  and the south of the country to end the PKK rebellion which has caused at  least 12,000 deaths since it erupted in August 1984.
