The Chinese authorities on Saturday followed up  the jailing of two US citizens for fraud by issuing a stern warning to  foreigners who flout the country's laws.
"Foreign businessmen who think they can do what they like in China are  wrong," said the People's Daily newspaper in a front page article, a day after  Chinese-Americans Fransisco Hung Moy and Raymond Lee, were jailed for 20 and  14 years respectively.
The pair were convicted of orchestrating a massive financial scam in which  they tricked a branch of the Agricultural Bank of China, in the northern Hebei  province, out of 200 standby letters of credit worth 10 billion dollars.
"The development of a socialist market economy is accompanied by a strict  legal framework which everybody must obey," the paper said. The editorial was  headlined "A rare case, a big lesson."
Referring directly to the case of the US citiziens, the newspaper said:  "Foreigners in China must respect Chinese law just as Chinese people have to  respect foreign law," it added.
The authorities were careful not to unduly frighten off much needed  foreign investors, stressing the aim was not to shut the door on businessmen,  but to get rid of dishonest ones.
"We want to defend the rights and interests of foreign societies. Friends  from all five continents are welcome in China," the article said.
