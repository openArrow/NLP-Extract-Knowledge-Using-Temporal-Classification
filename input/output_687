The Kuwaiti foreign ministry has urged people  travelling abroad to leave their maids at home saying they could be used as a  pretext to harm the country's reputation.
A ministry statement published in Kuwaiti newspapers Sunday said that  taking servants abroad would "bring trouble that undermines the image of  Kuwait."
There are more than 170,000 male and female servants currently working in  Kuwait, most of whom come from Asia.
The ministry's statement said: "The enemies of Kuwait abroad are waiting  for the chance to find mistakes and seduce the maids to harm Kuwait's  reputation by accusing Kuwaiti nationals of oppressing their maids and of  violating human rights laws."
In the past Kuwait has come under fire from human rights organisations for  alleged human rights abuses, especially since it was liberated from  Iraqi-occupation by a US-led coalition at the end of the Gulf war in February  1991.
