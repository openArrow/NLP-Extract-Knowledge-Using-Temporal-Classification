Brigitte Bardot, the French actress turned animal  rights campaigner, has appealed to President Hosni Mubarak to have Egypt's  pets sterilized and revive the Pharaonic respect for animals.
Dogs, cats and other pets are suffering "in a country where animals were  once respected and venerated," she wrote in a letter to Mubarak, a copy of  which was obtained by AFP.
The president must help "defend the identity of his country, based on its  special relationship with animals," by curbing the explosion of its animal  population through a mass sterilization campaign, she said.
In Pharaonic Egypt, cats, baboons and jackals were the objects of worship.
Bardot said stray dogs were proliferating and "multiplying a suffering  which must be countered urgently." The animals were often "covered with  infected wounds, suffering from various illnesses and starving."
She also appealed for the protection of Egypt's turtles, birds and  monkeys, condemning the unhygienic conditions in which they are often kept by  animal traders.
Egypt's population of more than 58 million people is also booming, with a  baby born every 22 seconds.
