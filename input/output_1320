Bosnian Serbs fired seven shells at Tuzla airport  in northern Bosnia-Hercegovina Tuesday shortly after the first UN plane in a  month (Eds: correct) landed on the northern airstrip, UN spokesmen said.
The plane immediately immediately took off after the first shells landed,  the UN Protection Force sources said adding that there were no casualties and  the aircraft was not damaged.
It was unclear, however, whether UN peacekeepers had finished unloading  the plane which was carrying American radar-tracking equipment and a Jordanian  battalion of UN soldiers.
The mainly Moslem Bosnian army handed over control of the airport to the  UNPROFOR in March after Russia applied diplomatic pressure on the Serbs to  allow humanitarian flights into the region.
But since then 22 planes have landed at the airport carrying equipment for  peacekeepers. The last flight was on April 14.
