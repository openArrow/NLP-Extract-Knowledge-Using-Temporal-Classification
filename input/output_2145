The FA acted with speed over the latest incident, charging Millwall with  crowd control failure just over 12 hours after two separate pitch invasions  and some of the worst crowd scenes witnessed in England for years.
Unless the South London club can satisfy the FA they took every possible  precaution, they face a heavy fine and an order to stage home matches away  from the New Den, which only opened this season.
The Den, Millwall's former ground, was closed four times in consecutive  decades going back to the 1930s because of crowd trouble.
Millwall missed out on possible promotion to the Premiership when they  lost the play off first leg 2-0 at Derby and were beaten 3-1 in the return.
The FA inquiry may also examine whether Millwall manager Mick McCarthy's  programme notes could have been inflammatory.
He wrote: "The Derby fans managed to make it a hostile environment for us  up there on Sunday and I know from experience they cannot hold a candle to the  Millwall crowd in this department."
Millwall chairman Reg Burr offered to resign on Thursday, although he  described the high-tension play-off system as "a recipe for violence".
However the Football League said the play-offs, which have been in place  for eight years, would continue.
Spokesman Ian Cotton said: "Ending them would not deal with the  fundamental problem a minority of clubs have with a section of their fans."
Sixteen arrests were made after the match and seven people were hurt,  including six police officers.
There were skirmishes in nearby streets before and after the game, and a  BBC vehicle was overturned in the New Den car park where up to 1,000 fans  rampaged.
