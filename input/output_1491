The picture is complicated by the small Free Democrat Party (FDP), which  has put up its Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher, 73, and by an independent from eastern  Germany enjoying the backing of intellectuals and the Green Party, 55-year-old  Jens Reich.
The 1,324 assembly electors -- the 662 members of the federal parliament  and the same number of delegates of the 16 regional states -- will have up to  three rounds of voting if no-one has an absolute majority in the first two  rounds.
The CDU-CSU with 619 votes can command the biggest block, the SPD disposes  of 502 votes and the FDP 111, the remaining 92 votes being accounted for by  the Alliance90/Greens group, ex-communists and others.
Although neither Hamm-Bruecher nor Reich can hope to be chosen as  president, the 111 votes of the FDP in particular will be decisive in  determining the winner after elimination of the two outsiders.
The FDP originally decided to put up its own candidate rather than support  Heitmann, but its votes are expected eventually to go to Herzog rather than  Rau when Hamm-Bruecher has to withdraw.
The system has thus given rise to manoeuvring and attempted horse-trading,  to the regret of Weizsaecker himself who had pleaded for the parties not to  use the issue for their usual party-political tactics.
The CDU has been determined not to allow the state presidency to go to the  Social Democrats, for fear this would augur ill for Kohl and his party just a  few months later, in the October 16 federal legislative election.
