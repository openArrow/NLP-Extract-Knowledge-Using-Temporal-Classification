The 73-year-old co-founder and chairman of Sony  Corp., Akio Morita, was discharged from hospital on Saturday and is recovering  from a surgery for a brain hemorrhage, a company spokesman said Monday.
"Doctors state that Morita's progress has been satisfactory. He is  currently undergoing physical therapy and is making steady progress in  speaking and walking," the spokesman said in a news release.
Morita, who co-authored the controversial book "A Japan That Can Say  'No'," had been hospitalized since undergoing surgery for a cerebral  hemorrhage on November 30 last year. He will continue his rehabilitation at  home, the spokesman said.
