China is set to become the world's largest  container maker this year with production expected to grow by nearly 70  percent to 420,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), a report said Monday.
Last year, China's container-manufacturing sector came out with a total of  250,000 twenty-foot equivalent units to become the world's second largest  container maker, the Beijing-backed Ta Kung Pao newspaper quoting China  Container Industry Association reported.
World's leading container makers included Japan, South Korea and the  United States.
However, the newly-developed industry is approaching saturation level as  the number of container makers mushrooms.
The association said foreign joint container ventures in China would be  "seriouly affected" in view of cut-throat pricing.
China's container ocean freight grew by 12 percent last year to three  millions TEUs, with 26.33 million tonnes of goods.
The country currently has 47 container ports.
