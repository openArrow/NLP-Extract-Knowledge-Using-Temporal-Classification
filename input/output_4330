A law banning both violent and peaceful  blocking of abortion clinics went into effect Thursday.
President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law, saying that crowds of  anti-abortion protestors trying to block women from entering the clinics were  an extreme threat to women's rights and law and order.
"We must remain committed to the rule of law. It's what keeps us  civilized," Clinton said at the White House.
Blocking women and employees, or demonstrating outside the clinics, is a  favorite tactic of abortion protestors.
The new law is a major victory for pro-abortion groups in the longrunning  and highly emotional fight.
But moments before Clinton signed the law, the American Life League  anti-abortion group sought an injunction at a federal court outside Washington  to prevent the new legislation from taking effect.
A second challenge to the law was being prepared for filing Thursday by  lawyers working for the biggest US anti-abortion group, Operation Rescue.
The law imposes prison terms and large fines on people blocking clinics or  using or threatening force against patients and clinic workers. Non-violent  actions, such as staging sit-ins in front of clinics are banned under the law,  as well as violent efforts to disrupt the clinics' work.
Supporters cite the often violent nature of the protests, which they say  deprive women of their right to privacy.
But anti-abortion activists say the new law violates their right to  protest and violates the constitutional guarantee to free speech.
