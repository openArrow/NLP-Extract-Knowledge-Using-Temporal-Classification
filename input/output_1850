Violent scenes and two pitch invasions marked  Millwall's 3-1 defeat in an English Division One football play-off against  Derby at the new Den Stadium here Wednesday night.
Match referee Brian Hill finally ended the match two minutes early with  Derby completing a 5-1 aggregate win.
Afterwards a 1,000-strong Millwall mob went on the rampage in the car park  outside the main West Stand -- wrecking cars and damaging property.
Mounted police were called in to quell the violence.
One police van came under attack and journalists were spat on and  threatened.
The first pitch invasion came after 32 minutes, with Millwall already 2-0  down. It lasted lasted 19 minutes.
Reports said the trouble flared when police went into the East Stand to  persuade fans without seats to move to another area. As some of the fans ran  across the pitch the referee took the players off.
The second invasion came after 74 minutes when Millwall were 3-1 down.  This time play was held up for 12 minutes and about 100 supporters poured on  to the pitch.
Derby goalkeeper Martin Taylor went down under what appeared to be a punch  as he fled for the shelter of the dressing-room.
