The White House said Wednesday it asked the  Justice Department's advice on the admissability of a suit filed against  President Bill Clinton over a sexual harassment incident alleged to have  occurred before he took office.
Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee, filed suit May 6 accusing  Clinton of making an unwanted sexual overture during an encounter in a Little  Rock, Arkansas hotel room on May 8,1991.
"There is no precedent for a president being sued as president for  something that occured before he became president," said White House press  secretary Dee Dee Myers.
She said White House counsel Lloyd Cutler "simply asked the Justice  Department to look into it. We're waiting for their response."
She said Jones' suit had institutional implications affecting future  presidents as well as Clinton.
"There are institutional concerns that affect the presidency, public  questions, and that's why Mr. Cutler has asked the Department of Justice. They  do affect the president as president," added Myers.
