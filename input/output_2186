IAEA inspectors in North Korea to find out if that  country is making nuclear weapons, have visited an experimental reactor and a  radiochemical laboratory at the Yongbyon nuclear complex and will continue  their inspection Friday, an IAEA spokesman said Thursday.
Hans-Friedrich Meyer would not comment on a report by the Washington Post  that the reclusive Stalinist country had begun removing spent fuel rods from  the reactor at the Yongbyon nuclear complex in defiance of international  warnings not to do so.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) receives daily reports from  the inspectors, he said, adding that IAEA member countries were kept informed  "in confidence" about what was in the reports.
He said the inspectors were tasked only with maintenance work consisting  in verifying seals placed on the reactor and replacing films and batteries in  cameras monitoring the nuclear site.
The United Nations and the United States have warned Pyongyang not to  remove the fuel rods before the IAEA inspectors can check them to see if  fissile material has been diverted to make a nuclear weapon.
For this purpose they will also take samples in the radiochemical lab.
Sources familiar with a preliminary report filed by the IAEA team had told  the Post that defueling at the Yongbyon reactor, 90 kilometers (54 miles)  north of Pyongyang, was in its early stage, meaning that only a small portion  of the estimated 8,000 plutonium-laden fuel rods had been removed.
North Korea's continued refusal to abide by the IAEA's non-proliferation  rules has led to international threats of UN sanctions, which in turn prompted  war threats from Pyongyang.
US Defense Secretary, William Perry, said Wednesday that his government  faced "a very substantial near-term crisis" with North Korea.
