An Andean volcano erupted here Tuesday,  spewing lava, smoke and ashes over a wide area, including across the border  into Argentina, officials said.
The El Llaima volcano eruption prompted an alert in several communities  around Temuco, some 610 kilometers (400 miles) south of Santiago, police said.
Ashes blown from the volcano also covered much of the Argentine city of  Zapala some 200 kilometers (120 miles) away with a layer of black soot,  officials there reported.
There were no immediate reports of any injuries on either side of the  border.
Chilean authorities said helicopter-borne observers witnessed a column of  smoke some 8,000 meters (26,000 feet) above El Llaima, which rises to 3,125  meters (10,000 feet).
