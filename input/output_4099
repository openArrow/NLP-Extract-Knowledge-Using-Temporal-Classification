Observers at the summit said member countries could pass a compromise  before the four-day meeting ends Thursday, possibly agreeing to phase in the  French proposal over an extended time period.
Seventy-five percent of the votes of the 31 countries represented at the  meeting must approve a proposal for it to pass.
Shima has said Japan would favor a compromise among all the proposals for  whale sanctuaries put forth at the meeting.
French delegate Laurent Stefanini said the smaller sanctuary proposed by  Chile, Mexico, Monaco, Sweden and Switzerland was 90 percent in agreement with  the French proposal and stood a good chance of being approved.
Stefanini acknowleged Mexico's help in establishing a "spirit of  compromise" between the seemingly irreconcilable positions of France and Japan.
The French delegate, however, said that his government was still opposed  to commercial whaling and strongly in favor of the moratorium on whale hunting  imposed 10 years ago.
Norwegian delegate Karsten Klepsvik said he would not vote in favor of the  compromise solution.
"Like it or not, the whaling industry cannot be ignored," he said  confirming environmentalists' suspicions that his country hunted whales for  meat.
Chile, which does not want a sanctuary to include its territorial waters,  favors establishing a protection zone between 45 and 60 degrees latitude.
IWC President Luis Fleisher said that while the world ban on whaling  continued, the IWC was studying more humane methods of killing the marine  mammals.
Other issues dealt with at the meeting Wednesday included whale hunting by  indigenous people, reports on illegal commerce in whale meat and whale  counting.
In addition to commercial hunting, whales currently are under threat from  environmental changes, such as the destruction of the ozone layer protecting  Earth from the sun's ultraviolet rays.
