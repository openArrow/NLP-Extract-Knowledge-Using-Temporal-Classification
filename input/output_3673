French and Italian police visited the Renault  Sports offices at Viry-Chatillon, Essone on Tuesday as part of an  investigation into the death of Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna.
They were reported to have taken away certain information from the 'black  box' on Senna's Renault-Williams car which they hope will throw light on the  crucial seconds leading up to the crash.
The investigation is being headed by an Italian investigating magistrate  in Bologna.
Senna was killed in an accident at Imola on May 1 during the San Marino  Grand Prix.
