About 300 employees of the British banana  exporter Geest Caribbean ended a 10-day strike Tuesday and went back to work  after reaching agreement with management, the government said.
Labor Minister Farid Ayales said the company had agreed to the workers  main demands to settle the strike, which erupted in its Sarapiqui plantations  after several workers were fired and wages of others were cut.
The company agreed to hire workers directly -- rather than through  subcontractors -- and guarantee their rights under the law.
The company also said it would reinstate the fired workers, recognize the  workers union, and meet with union representatives in the coming days to  settle demands for a pay increase.
During the walk-out, 14 workers were wounded by gunfire when police tried  to use force to break up the strike.
