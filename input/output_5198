Greek singer Nana Mouskouri has adopted a novel  approach to campaigning for next month's European Parliament elections,  admitting she knows nothing about politics.
While most candidates are out canvassing public support for the June 12  poll, Mouskouri, 58 and a resident of France, admits she is afraid of  politics. And she appears more concerned with winning new fans than votes,  having embarked on a concert tour in Latin America.
Mouskouri, who left Greece 30 years ago, told the Eleftherotypia newspaper  in an interview published Sunday that "there is no way I will be participating  in the current political scene, which frightens me and with which I am not  familiar.
"It is a matter for the specialists," she said.
Questioned about Greece's dispute with neighbouring Macedonia over the  former Yugoslav republic's name, Mouskouri said "I don't know anything about  it."
She said that if elected she would concentrate "mainly on artistic,  cultural and ecological affairs."
Mouskouri is a friend of New Democracy Party boss Miltiadis Evert, whom  she has known since she was 15. Placed third on the party's list, she is  assured of election to the Strasbourg-based legislature.
However, with 15 days to go to polling, Mouskouri's laid-back campaign  style has been savaged by some opponents, who have been less than impressed by  her claim that on political issues, "numerous and important representatives in  the European Parliament ... will be able to enlighten me."
