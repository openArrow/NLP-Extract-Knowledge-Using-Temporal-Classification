Danielle Mitterrand, head of the human rights group  France Libertes and wife of the French president, on Monday denounced  Indonesia's moves to force the Filipino government into forbidding her from  attending a banned conference on East Timor.
The Indonesian government had put "tyrannical pressure on us and on the  Filipino government to stop me from going to this meeting," Mitterrand told  journalists, stressing that this "blackmail" was "endangering civil peace" in  the Philippines.
"I gave in, I won't go," she said. "We are not provocative. By going there  I was throwing oil on the fire," Mitterrand said, adding that she did "not  want to aggravate the difficulties faced by the young Filipino democracy."
According to Mitterrand, Indonesia threatened to suspend trade deals with  the Philippines worth some 300 million dollars.
She said that on April 18 she accepted the invitation by the organisers  and had written a "very courteous letter" to Indonesia's President Suharto  asking to meet him.
This move had "enraged" the Indonesian authorities, she said.
Meanwhile, Maria Barroso Soares, wife of the Porutuguese head of state,  said she had been obliged to decline the invitation to attend the conference  due to a "heavy schedule."
But she denounced "the genocide" of the "martyred and tortured population"  of East Timor by Indonesia.
