US Secretary of State Warren Christopher began talks  here late Wednesday with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on relaunching the  different tracks of the Arab-Israeli peace talks, an official source said.
Christopher was due to brief Mubarak after ending his four-day shuttle  mission between Israel and Syria aimed at kickstarting the stalled peace talks.
Syrian presidential spokesman Gebran Kurieh said after Christopher left  Damascus Wednesday that the two countries were still far apart in the peace  moves, blaming the Israelis for their position.
Christopher was trying to narrow differences between the two over the  disputed Golan Heights seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and which  have remained the main stumbling block in the talks.
The Arab-Israeli talks have been stalled since a Jewish settler killed 30  Arabs in a Hebron mosque on February 25.
