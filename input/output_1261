AC Milan's Croatian forward Zvonomir Boban passed a  fitness test here Tuesday and should play in the European Cup final against  Barcelona on Wednesday.
However, Milan coach Fabio Capello refused to be explicit.
"He's getting better every day and should play," Capello said.
Danish forward Brian Laudrup is on standby to replace him on the right of  the midfield with Roberto Donadoni switching to the left flank.
Suspended central defenders Franco Baresi and Alessandro Costacurta took  part in the training session at the Olympic stadium.
Paolo Maldini moves from left back to replace Baresi as sweeper with  Filippo Galli coming in as stopper.
Maldini is a fast, accomplished left back but French fans remember Chris  Waddle running rings round him when Olympique Marseille knocked Milan out of  the European Cup in 1991.
Capello said he was confident about the outcome.
"Everybody says Barcelona are the favourites so for the first time Milan  does not play under the additional pressure of being expected to win," he said.
Capello said Milan would not designate anyone to mark Barcelona's twin  strikers Romario and Hristo Stoichkov.
"We play zonal defence," he added.
Milan (probable): Sebiastano Rossi, Mauro Tassotti (capt), Filippo Galli,  Paolo Maldini, Christian Panucci, Roberto Donadoni, Marcel Desailly, Demetrio  Albertini, Zvonomir Boban, Dejan Savicevic, Daniele Massaro
