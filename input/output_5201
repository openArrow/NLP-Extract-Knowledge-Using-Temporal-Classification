The so-called "Sarajevo List" will garner just four  percent in next month's elections to the European parliament, barely a third  of the figure cited in earlier soundings, an opinion poll indicated Sunday.
Launched on May 15 by philosopher and writer Bernard-Henri Levy, the  "Europe Starts at Sarajevo" group vowed to fight the June 12 poll calling for  the Moslem-dominated Bosnian government to be exempted from a UN arms embargo  against ex-Yugoslavia.
The poll, carried out by the Sofres organisation for the La Tribune  business newspaper and BFM radio station, was conducted before the group  officially entered the race Friday.
The Sarajevo list, made up of journalists, writers, artists, actors and  university teachers, had demonstrated support of between seven percent and 12  percent in the two most recent previous polls.
The Sofres poll revealed 32.5 percent support for the ruling right-wing  coalition of the Rally for the Republic and Union for French Democracy, with  the Socialists of former premier Michel Rocard a distant second with 17  percent.
Turnout is predicted at 47 percent, down from 50 percent a month ago.
The Sarajevo list is expected to take votes from the Socialists and left  of centre lists, including that of Socialist rebel and former defence minister  Jean-Pierre Chevenement and beleaguered millionaire businessman Bernard Tapie.
The entry of the intellectuals into the political fray has forced both the  conservative government and socialist President Francois Mitterrand to defend  their position on Bosnia, and has placed the war there at the heart of the  European electoral campaign in France.
