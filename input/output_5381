Omaha was the beach where the D-Day invasion almost  failed.
The US first infantry division, the "Big Red One," and the 29th infantry  division landed at 6:30 a.m. to a horrible surprise. The air bombardments had  not eliminated their targets, the extensive system of mines and tank traps the  Germans had laid and that were exposed at low tide.
Also, the Nazi 352nd infantry division was there by chance, a well-armed,  top-level force of 12,000 men.
And they had ideal conditions in which to respond to an attacking force.  The six-kilometre (four-mile) beach was at the foot of cliffs that gave good  vision to fields of fire that formed an effective killing box.
The morning was a massacre. Some 3,000 allied soldiers eventually died at  Omaha, many drowning as the tide came in on them.
But US General Omar Bradley persisted. Reinforcements and ammunition were  brought in, while the Germans, pinned down by air and naval fire, were unable  to re-supply.
Special Ranger forces managed to reach the German lines and destroyed  bunkers.
Finally, US soldiers stormed up a grassy bluff towards Vierville. Two  destroyers closed towards the shore to face-off against German heavy guns.
By evening the Americans had secured Omaha beach, facing the towns of  Vierville, Collevillle-sur-Mer and Saint-Laurent, northwest of Bayeux.
