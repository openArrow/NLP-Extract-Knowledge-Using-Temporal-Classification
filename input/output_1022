A bomb exploded in the administrative offices of  the Turkish postal service Monday, killing one person and injuring another,  both believed to be involved in planting the device, police said.
The afternoon blast took place in the toilets of the building.
Another bomb which exploded in a train at Istanbul station overnight  Sunday hurt two people, also believed to be responsible for the attack.
On Sunday a bomb attack in a cinema wounded 12 people, including six  soldiers, in Elazig, southeastern Turkey.
A Russian-made explosive device was thrown inside the cinema premises  where 140 people were watching a film. There was no immediate claim of  responsibility.
Police generally attribute blame for such attacks on the outlawed Kurdish  separatist guerilla movement, the Kurdistan Workers' Party.
