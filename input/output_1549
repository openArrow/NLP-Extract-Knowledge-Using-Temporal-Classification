The Japanese government submitted to parliament  Tuesday a 40-day extention of a stop-gap budget for the current fiscal year  which began April 1, officials said.
The government of former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa was forced to  draft the 50-day provisional budget, which will expire May 20, due to  political turmoil, which is continuing to stall the passage of the national  budget.
At a lower house budget committee, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said  Wednesday "I feel a big responsibility" for the delay in state budget  deliberations.
"I keenly feel it is giving adverse effects" to the economy, he said.
Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii also said at the lower house commitee that  the delay was "extremely abnormal."
The new 40-day extension worth 10.89 trillion yen (104.3 billion dollars)  was endorsed at an extraordinary cabinet meeting Wednesday for immediate  submission to parliament.
If parliament approves the extension, to June 29, the revised stop-gap  measures worth totaling 21.94 trillion yen are expected to be the longest  since 1955.
