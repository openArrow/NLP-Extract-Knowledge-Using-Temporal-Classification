A capsule containing highly radioactive cesium 137  was stolen from a factory in Ukraine, Interfax quoted security officials as  saying Thursday.
Police had no indication as to who stole the capsule in what they  described as a serious incident. A spokesman said the capsule may have been  opened.
Three employees at the factory in Nikolayev were taken to Kiev and Kharkov  for check-ups after displaying symptoms of radiation contamination, while ten  others were undergoing on-the-spot tests.
