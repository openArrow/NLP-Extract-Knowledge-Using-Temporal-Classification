The self-confessed killer of presidential  candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio will be prosecuted with second-degree murder,  the presiding judge said.
Authorities found no evidence to support charges of premeditation or  cruelty in the March 23 shooting in Tijuana of the ruling Institutional  Revolutionary Party (PRI) candidate, District Judge Carlos Hugo Luna said  Monday.
Prosecutors last month requested that the charges be modified to  first-degree murder.
Mario Aburto, 23, confessed to killing Colosio shortly after his arrest,  but it is still unclear whether he acted alone or with several others.
Ernesto Zedillo, Colosio's successor as PRI presidential candidate, said  Monday that he spoke for all his fellow party members in demanding that the  motive for the assassination be fully investigated.
Six of Aburto's relatives fled across the border to seek political asylum  in United States on Sunday, claiming they were being harassed in Mexico.
They were identified Monday by their lawyer Peter Schey as Aburto's  mother, brother, two sisters, a nephew and a sister-in-law. He said Aburto's  father and two other brothers lived in Torrence, California.
The US Customs Border Patrol said it was unable to positively identify the  asylum seekers, who claimed that all their documents were taken away after the  assassination by Mexican authorities.
Schey said that the group had also told him that there had been attempted  break-ins at their home in Mexico and that one of their parked cars had been  riddled with bullets.
