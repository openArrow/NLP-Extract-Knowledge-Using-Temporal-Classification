A British gay rights group called Outrage urged  Queen Elizabeth II Monday to issue a posthumous pardon for Oscar Wilde, who  was jailed for being homosexual.
The petition coincides with the 99th anniversary of the Irish writer's  sentencing to two years of hard labor on May 25, 1895.
"Wilde was the victim of unjust laws. His imprisonment is a stain on the  judicial system," Outrage spokesman Peter Tatchell said.
After being freed from prison, Wilde left Britain and settled in France,  where he died at the age of 44.
His works include "The Portrait of Dorian Gray" and "The Importance of  Being Earnest".
