The European court of justice dismissed a suit  by Air France on Thursday seeking to stop British Airways from buying out 49.9  percent of the French air company TAT.
The case dates back to November 1992 when the European Commission gave the  go-ahead for the purchase. Air France lodged an appeal three months later,  arguing that commission officials handling anti-trust and competition  regulations had refused to apply them to British Airways though they had  enforced them in other comparable circumstances.
