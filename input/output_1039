Wal-Mart, the biggest US discount  store chain, announced Monday first quarter earnings of 498 million dollars,  up from 450 million dollars a year ago.
The earnings figure amounts to 22 cents a share for the quarter ending  April 30, compared to 20 cents a share the same quarter last year.
Sales rose to a record 17 billion dollars, up 27 percent from the first  quarter of 1993.
A strong rise in food, electronic and seasonal goods contributed to the  sales figures, according to Wal-Mart.
The company opened new stores, raising the total to 1,960 in the United  States against 1,874 in last year's first quarter. It also bought 122 Woolco  stores in Canada, which will be converted to Wal-Mart stores by the end of the  year.
The conversion of Pace Club stores, a former rival chain bought by  Wal-Mart, into Sam's Club is nearly complete with the number of stores rising  to 427 from 227 last year.
