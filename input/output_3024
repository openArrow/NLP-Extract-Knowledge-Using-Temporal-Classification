The US company Westinghouse is planning to help  complete Soviet-designed nuclear reactors in the Czech Republic, The New York  Times reported Sunday.
The US government believes the US technical help could make the reactors  safer and could be the first step in a broader effort at other Soviet-designed  sites, the Times said.
It would be the first attempt to marry US and Soviet reactor technologies  and has the support of the US government, which recently approved 317 million  dollars in loan guarantees to pay for the project, the Times said.
But Senator Patrick Leahy opposed the move, saying it could end up as  nothing more than a US subsidy of a dangerous plant. "Any possibility that  American taxpayers could be liable for a nuclear accident in the Czech  Republic ... is unacceptable," he said.
But White House director of environmental policy Kathleen McGinty said the  project showed Washington would not "be a party to looking the other way while  another Chernobyl occurs."
However, the reactors in Temelin, Czech Republic, are the most advanced  designed by the Soviets and not the type that exploded at Chernobyl, Ukraine  in 1986.
