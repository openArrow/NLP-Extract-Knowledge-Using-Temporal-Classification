A UN envoy arrived in Kigali on Tuesday and held  talks with Rwandan army commanders to pave the way for a new UN peacekeeping  mission in blood-drenched Rwanda despite rebel objections, a spokesman said.
The envoy, Iqbal Riza, met rebel leaders in their northern stronghold of  Mulindi on Monday but was unable to reach agreement with them on the size of a  planned UN force, spokesman Abdul Kabia said.
The rebels object to the UN's plan to send 5,500 peacekeepers to Rwanda  and maintain that 2,500 soldiers will be enough to escort relief convoys.
The blue helmets have not been mandated to intervene in fighting between  the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front and government forces.
But they are supposed to stem the wholesale slaughter of civilians by  bloodthirsty militiamen. Up to half a million Rwandans have been butchered in  six weeks of ethnic carnage.
Diplomats and military analysts, however, said it was unclear how they  could do so, whether they numbered 5,500 or 2,500.
The rebels objected to Riza's plan to hold talks with the self-proclaimed  interim government on Wednesday, saying such a meeting would be tantamount to  recognising the government's legitimacy.
But Kabia said the planned meeting "does not constitute recognition of the  government."
"The special envoy will see the government as the de facto authority  because he was mandated to talk to all parties," Kabia told AFP by telephone  from Kigali.
Rebels and government soldiers held fire as Riza's plane arrived from the  Ugandan capital Kampala late Tuesday morning.
Riza cancelled his plan to drive to Kigali from rebel headquarters in  Mulindi, near the Ugandan border, on Monday, saying neither side could  guarantee his security.
