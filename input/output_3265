The chauffeur of slain anti-Mafia judge  Giovanni Falcone chained himself to the railings of a Palermo court Monday,  saying the injuries he suffered when the magistrate's car was blown up two  years ago had been forgotten.
Giuseppe Costanza, 38, was badly hurt when Falcone's armour-plated car was  dynamited in a Mafia attack on May 23, 1992, on a motorway leading to Palermo  airport.
Falcone and his wife were both killed in the blast, along with three  bodyguards travelling in an escort vehicle.
Today, Costanza is 54 percent disabled and can no longer drive. His  protest outside the court was designed to bring to public attention the fact  that the state had not found him another job or promoted him.
Costanza, who complained the authorities had "realised I was not a soldier  and concluded they owed me nothing," stood with a placard around his neck  bearing the words "victim of the Mafia and the state."
