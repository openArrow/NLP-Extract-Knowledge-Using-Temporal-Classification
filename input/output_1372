Investors in the troubled Lloyd's of London  insurance market were hit with massive losses of 2.048 billion pounds (3.072  billion dollars) for 1991 on Tuesday.
Last year the market had reported that in 1990 it had made record losses  of 2.3 billion pounds.
The 1991 losses, which will increase the financial pressure on the 26,539  wealthy investors or "names", brings the total deficit of the 306-year-old  insurance market during the past four years to seven billion pounds.
Letters were to be sent to hard-pressed names, asking them to pay up. Some  of the money is due by the end of July. Between 7,000 and 9,000 names are  currently believed to have liabilities exceeding their assets.
However the losses, announced three years in arrears to take account of  claims, were less than the figure of 2.5 billion pounds which had been feared  and chairman David Rowland held out the prospect of better times ahead.
"For most insurers worldwide, 1991 was a difficult year and Lloyd's  results, although better than 1990, still show a serious loss," he said.
"I am glad to say that conditions have improved substantially and I look  forward to reporting better results," he said.
"Trading in 1991 contained the beginnings of an improvement in rating  conditions and underwriting practices which, by 1993, had led the market to  trade at a substantial profit."
The 1990 losses, initially reported at 2.9 billion pounds, were revised  downwards by 0.6 billion pounds because some losses had been counted twice, a  Lloyd's spokesman said.
This was the first time that Lloyd's had deducted "double counting"  losses. In 1991, the market would have registered additional losses of 533  million pounds but for this proceedure.
Net premium income was 6.014 billion pounds in 1991 compared with 5.3  billion pounds in 1990.
The results were affected by "an unusually high incidence of 29  catastrophes" (a catastrophe is recorded if the insurance damage exceeds 100  million dollars) in the marine, non-marine and aviation sectors.
The two most serious were typhoon Mireille in Japan and the fires in  Oakland, California with insured losses of respectively around five billion  dollars and 1.2 billion dollars for Lloyd's and other insurers.
The 1991 results included a pure year loss of 615 million pounds compared  with losses of 937.4 million in 1990, a reduction of 34 percent. This  improvement was attributed mainly to an increase in insurance premiums in all  sectors.
Pure year results are the underwriting results for the year of account  specified without accounting for deterioration on any previous years closed  into it. The total results for the year include any such deterioration.
Of the 349 syndicates writing in 1991, 111 made a profit of 205 million  pounds after personal expenses.
The names, who guarantee the insurance contracts with unlimited liability  on their personal wealth, are already suffering difficulties repaying the five  billion pounds of losses registered by Lloyd's between 1988 and 1990.
Already 3,095 names are claiming 629 million pounds in damages for alleged  negligence and mismanagement by their 71 agents in one of the biggest lawsuits  in English history.
Agents do not underwrite personally but act as advisers to prospective  investors.
A total of eight names have allegedly committed suicide on account of  massive losses suffered under Lloyd's syndicates.
The 1991 deficit was thought likely to cause more names to leave the  market. More than 2,000 left in 1993 and since 1990 over 11,200 have departed.  Lloyd's has a total of 17,526 names trading this year.
Last week, Lloyd's announced that it would authorise names to "borrow" up  to three percent of their allocated premium income this year against their  1991 losses.
