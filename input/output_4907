The UN food agency said Saturday that some 1.6  million Rwandans displaced since the country plunged into civil war seven  weeks ago were in desperate need of food aid.
The World Food Programme (WFP) was, jointly with the Red Cross, feeding  240,000 displaced people in accessible areas of Kigali, northeastern and  southern Rwanda, but that was just a fraction of those in need, a WFP  statement released here said.
"There is growing acute need of relief assistance for the affected  population, particularly in Kigali and southern Rwanda where cases of  malnutrition are reported to be on the increase," WFP director Catherine  Bertini was quoted as saying.
An estimated 200,000 to half a million people have been killed in ethnic  massacres, pitting the majority Hutu tribe against the minority Tutsis, which  erupted following the death of President Juvenal Habyarimana in a suspicious  plane crash on April 6.
Half a million other people have fled to neighbouring countries.
