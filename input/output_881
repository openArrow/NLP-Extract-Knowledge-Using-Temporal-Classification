Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said Monday Japan may  help US forces take action against North Korea's refusal to allow full  international inspections of its nuclear facilities.
"Generally speaking, cooperation with US activities will be made within  the limits of the constitution under any circumstances," Hata told the House  of Councillors.
Hata was replying after an opposition lawmaker asked if Japan would assist  any US military action in the Korean nuclear crisis, in addition to helping  impose any UN sanctions against the hardline communist state.
Japan's pacifist post-World War II constitution bars the use of force in  settling international disputes, effectively preventing Japanese troops from  joining UN peace-keeping combat missions.
But members of Hata's three-week-old cabinet have suggested new  legislation to expand Japan's emergency activities, including logistical  support for US forces in actions such as a naval blockade.
