Amid rumors of a coup, renewed threats of street  protests, worker shutdowns and seemingly endless currency devaluations,  President Rafael Caldera's government is facing a crucial week, analysts said  Sunday.
Visits by Amnesty International and the International Monetary Fund are  putting an intense spotlight on the government as it attempts to defuse the  crisis.
Student demonstrations have shaken Caracas and ten cities around the  nation in recent days and Caldera has vowed to "not permit disturbances of the  public order provoked by subversive elements."
In a sharp departure from his usually low-key approach to social unrest,  Caldera has ordered the military and police "to act with total energy to  prevent or repress street demonstrations."
Students launched protests two weeks ago, alleging that the government did  not follow through on its promise to allow student-fare reductions on public  transport. They are also demanding the punishment of police who killed a  student at a rally.
Rioting students burned cars, attacked businesses and erected roadblocks.  Events took a darker twist Thursday when sub-machine gun fire from inside the  Central University of Venezuela heavily damaged two troop carriers.
The violence prompted the US State Department to notify its nationals  about the demonstrations and warn them to avoid the disturbances.
