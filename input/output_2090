NATO's offer to grant privileged relations to  Russia "echoes" an idea already put forth by Moscow on establishing  cooperation between the former communist state and the Atlantic alliance, a  Russian foreign ministry spokesman said.
The main point of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization proposal is that  the sort of dialogue being considered by NATO with Moscow "is to correspond to  the role of our country in maintaining security in Europe," spokesman Grigori  Karassin said.
On Wednesday, NATO agreed at a meeting of ambassadors from its 16 member  countries to establish a special relationship with Russia, without however  granting Moscow the special status it has been demanding to joint the  so-called Partnership for Peace program offered this year to all former  Eastern bloc countries.
The program was designed to broaden military cooperation between NATO and  former commmunist states without offering full membership in NATO.
But Russia has held off any formal acceptance of the Partnership offer,  pushing for special treatment in line with its status as a nuclear superpower.
