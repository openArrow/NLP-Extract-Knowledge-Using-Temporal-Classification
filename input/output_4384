PLO chief Yasser Arafat has been treated twice for  stress and exhaustion in the past week, spending the night in a hospital here  on Monday, colleagues said Thursday.
Tunisian and Palestinian doctors advised Arafat to rest after a medical  examination last Friday, but after suffering a relapse Monday he was admitted  to the military hospital in Tunis where he underwent more tests, they said.
He has since returned to work full-time at Palestine Liberation  Organisation headquarters in Tunis, the unnamed colleagues said.
Arafat is busy with meetings here to nominate members of the self-rule  authority running the Gaza Strip and Jericho, and to make preparations for his  return to the territories next month.
Some PLO officials say he may also be under stress as a result of reported  family conflicts.
But his wife Suha Tawil has dismissed rumors she was planning to file for  divorce, saying the couple could only be separated by death, the Al-Hayat  newspaper reported Thursday.
Speculation that the couple was heading for divorce swept PLO headquarters  in Tunis after Arafat ordered the detention last Friday of Tawil's uncle,  George Hawa, in an inquiry into a corruption scandal.
Tawil dismissed reports of his arrest as "unfounded rumours." But security  sources here said Hawa, a businessman based in London, was still in detention  on Thursday. Other sources said earlier he had been released on Wednesday.
Some Palestinian officials said Arafat was also under stress due to  controversy over his decision to have Morgan Stanley Asset Management, a  subsidiary of a powerful US financial firm, manage international aid for  rebuilding the territories.
Meanwhile, the PLO leadership was expected to make more appointments  overnight Thursday to the self-rule authority.
In Jerusalem, Israeli Police Minister Moshe Shahal said Arafat would  arrive in the territories on June 15, but the Israeli cabinet denied a date  had been set.
