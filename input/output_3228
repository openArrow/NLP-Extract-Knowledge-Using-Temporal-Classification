Ken Griffey Jnr, 24, equalled his  famous father's career home run total Sunday with his 20th homer of the season  in only his 42nd game of 1994.
Griffey's 20 home runs in 42 games was the biggest season-opening total  since Mickey Mantle blasted 20 in 41 games to start the 1956 season.
If Griffey maintains the same pace, he is on course to hit 77 home runs  this season.
"He is something special," said Lou Pinella, manager of Griffey's Seattle  Mariners. "I'll tell you what, he really is."
Griffey proved the undoing of the Texas Rangers during their four-day trip  to Seattle.
On Thursday Seattle rallied from an 0-4 deficit to win 5-4.
Griffey homered in each of the remaining three games, on Friday, Saturday  and Sunday, as Seattle swept the series.
