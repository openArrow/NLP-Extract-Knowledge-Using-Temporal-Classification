Tonga's King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV wants to swap  sugar for uranium from Central Asia to feed a proposed nuclear power facility,  pay for Russian jets and resettle farmers in Malaysia, the Tongan monthly news  magazine Lali reports in its latest issue.
The sugar would come from plantations yet to be planted, while the uranium  would be used for a power station the king wants to build near his capital,  Nuku'alofa.
He also wants to buy Russian jets and settle Tongan farmers in the  Malaysian state of Sarawak to provide hurricane prone Tonga with food.
Taufa'ahau has a long track record for unusual ideas, most of which do not  turn into anything concrete.
