Portuguese Interior Minister Dias Loureiro said  Monday he had sacked the director general of the country's SIS intelligence  services and the organisation's regional director in Madeira.
The decision to dismiss the two officials came two days after the press  published the conclusions of an official report which concluded the SIS had  overstepped its authority in the Portuguese archipelago.
The enquiry arose after allegations by Madeira's prosecutor general that  the SIS had pried into his private life and into the affairs of other  magistrates.
The allegation was not proved, but the investigation established the SIS  had looked into matters which did not legally concern it. These included  prostitution, the corruption of minors and the affairs of political parties.        One of the SIS's main targets was reputedly the Social Democratic Party of  Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva.
The affair came to light with the discovery late last month of a  microphone hidden under the prosecutor's floorboards.
No direct link to the SIS was made but political parties claimed the  organisation had been involved.
