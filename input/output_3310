A southern missile crashed into the Yemeni capital  on Monday, causing several casualties, the official news agency SABA said.
The agency, run by the north, said the missile landed in a residential  district of Sanaa.
The north has now accused the south of firing 23 missiles at the capital  and other northern cities since civil war broke out more than two weeks ago,  including an attack on May 11 which killed 25 civilians in Sanaa.
Four people were killed and nine wounded in a missile attack Sunday on the  southern port city of Aden, but the north denied it was responsible.
