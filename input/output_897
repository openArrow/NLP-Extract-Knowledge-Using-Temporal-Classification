An artist who snipped off his pubic hair in  public to protest press coverage of Singapore's gay community pleaded guilty  Monday to obscenity.
Josef Ng Sing Chor faces up to three months jail and a fine of 2,000  Singapore dollars (1,290 US) or both when he comes up for sentencing before a  judge Tuesday.
Ng, a 22-year-old navy sergeant, triggered calls for tighter government  supervision over the performance arts, by turning his back on shoppers in a  crowded mall, dropping his briefs and cutting his pubic hair.
The New Year's eve performance was promptly condemned by Singapore's  National Arts Council which called the act "vulgar and completely  distasteful."    The council and police also barred Ng and another performer  who forced himself to vomit before the same audience from performing in public  again.
"I was making a statement. I did it for the sake of my art," Ng said  before pleading guilty.
