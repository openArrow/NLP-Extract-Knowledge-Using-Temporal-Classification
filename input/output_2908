As the Cannes filmfest approaches its  climax Monday evening, the race for the coveted Golden Palm has apparently  narrowed down to two or three films in the running for the top award.
But with all 23 films in competition now viewed, observers stress that  jury decisions are notoriously unpredictable, and that a surprise winner  cannot be ruled out.
"There really is nothing absolutely outstanding, in the league of 'Piano'  or "Concubine' last year," said one critic, referring to last year's joint  Palm winners by New Zealander Jane Campion and China's Chen Kaige.
"There are a number of films which could easily be pulled from the  envelope on Monday night," he added.
The main contender, according to the critics, is Polish filmmaker  Krzysztof Kieslowski's "Three Colours Red," the final part of his tricolour  cinematic trilogy following "Blue" and "White."
In a running poll in 'Moving Pictures' magazine, published here daily and  putting together critical ratings from around the world, the film is the only  one to score an average of eight out of 10.
The top prize for Kieslowski would bring him an unprecedented triple win:  the previous parts of the trilogy have already picked up the top prizes at the  Venice and Berlin film festivals.
But "Red" is not on its own. Of the films still in the running, Chinese  filmmaker Zhang Yimou's "To Live," has been widely seen as the next strongest  contender, followed by Italian Nanni Moretti's "Dear Diary."
The two films score 7.5 and 7 respectively in 'Moving Pictures'' poll of  critics.
