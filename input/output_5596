Japanese Trade Minister Eijiro Hata on Tuesday  renewed his opposition to setting numerical targets in trade with the United  States, saying they would not provide "a practical resolution" to trade  framework talks.
Hata told reporters Japan could not accept any proposals to set numerical  targets, which Tokyo fears would lead to managed trade.
"That's something the private sector should take care of," he said ahead  of the scheduled resumption of trade talks which are aimed at cutting Japan's  huge 59 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States.
"Governments must not set the goals, which will not lead to practical  resolution of the talks," he said.
Working-level trade talks are scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday,  separately in Tokyo and Washington, to cover auto parts and insurance issues.
Following a three-month deadlock, the two countries reached an agreement  last week to resume the stalled talks in a bid to conclude negotiations in  time for a July summit of the Group of Seven (G7) summit in Naples, Italy.
