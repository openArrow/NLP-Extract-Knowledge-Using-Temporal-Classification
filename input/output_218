Striking sailing staff of the SNCM shipping  company decided to resume work on Friday after a court ordered suspension of  their strike earlier in the day, company management announced.
The announcement said the first ferries for Corsica would sail in the  evening.
Traffic will resume "as soon as loading and sailing preparations have been  completed, whatever the number of passengers may be", it said.
The conflict related to staffing and working conditions.
