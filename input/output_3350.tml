Leftback Luis Cristaldo, 24, may also <EVENT eid="e4" class="I_ACTION" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="may">catch</EVENT> the eye. Like Andreas Brehme  for Germany, he is a continual attacking threat and has a formidable  long-range shot.&#13;
Apart from a 6-0 <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">loss</EVENT> to Brazil in the return qualifier, Azkargorta's  defenders have <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">proven</EVENT> reliable. Marco Sandy, Gustavo Quinteros, and Miguel  Rimba form the nucleus of their rearguard.&#13;
For a country of less than eight million people with just 15,000  registered players qualification is a major achievement in itself.
