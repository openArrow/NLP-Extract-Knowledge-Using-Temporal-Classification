Australia announced Friday it had won a  multi-million dollar contract to train 60 Vietnamese pilots to aid that  country's air safety and tourism.
The two-year nine-million-Australian-dollar (6.5-million-US) contract was  sealed by national flag-carrier Qantas and the Australian Aviation College of  Adelaide, South Australia.
"This is a tremendous boost for Australia's aviation industry and for  South Australia," said Gordon Bilney, minister for development cooperation.
"This project will raise the Australian aviation industry's international  profile, especially in Southeast Asia, one of the world's most important  emerging markets."
Training would boost Vientamese air safety and tourism, Bilney said in a  statement.
Vietnam planned to upgrade its current fleet of aging Soviet aircraft and  leased modern aircraft from Western countries, Bilney said, and wanted to  train its own pilots to take over from those currently on contract from  overseas.
The aviation college had already trained 677 pilots of whom 570 were from  developing countries including China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea,  the Solomon Islands, South Korea and Oman.
The first Vietnamese trainee pilots were due to arrive in June.
