Applications by South Korean firms seeking to make  direct overseas investments from January to April doubled compared to the  first four months of 1993, the central Bank of Korea (BOK) said Tuesday.
South Korea approved 589 projects valued at 1.117 billion dollars to  domestic firms for the first four months to April, up 108.9 percent in volume  from the 282 projects worth 527 million dollars over the same period last  year.
A BOK official cited a relaxation of government regulations on overseas  investments, and the fact that small- and medium-sized firms were struggling  to escape three domestic highs -- high labor costs, high interest rates and  high land prices.
Manufacturing comprised 75.2 percent or 726 million dollars of the total  investments, taking the lion's share, followed by the trading sector with 10  percent worth 244 million dollars.
By region, Asia topped the list with 84.3 percent of the total volume  while North America and Europe placed second and third.
China emerged as the favorite because of low labor costs and short-term  market prospects, showing a 98.8 percent increase to 220 million dollars  during the four month period from the last year, bank officials said.
