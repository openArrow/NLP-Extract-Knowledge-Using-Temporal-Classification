Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi scraped through a  Senate confidence motion by a single vote Wednesday, effectively giving his  right-wing cabinet the green light as Italy's 53rd post-war government.
The cliffhanger vote on his team, which includes five neo-fascists, set  the stage for Berlusconi to get down to work because the coalition he led to  victory at the polls six weeks ago has a comfortable majority in the Chamber  of Deputies.
A confidence vote scheduled there Friday is seen as a formality.
Senate speaker Carlo Scognamiglio said that of 314 senators casting votes  in the 326-seat chamber, 159 cast ballots in favor, 153 were against and two  abstained. An absolute majority of those voting was 158.
Berlusconi squeezed through after four centrist senators left the chamber  rather than vote. Under Senate voting rules, he needed a majority of those  present, not a majority of the total 326.
The centrists' party, the disgraced former Christian Democrats who now  call themselves the Italian Popular Party, immediately suspended those  senators pending a decision by party superiors.
Controversy leading up to the vote had centered on the presence of the  neo-fascists in Berlusconi's 25-member cabinet, with centrists calling on him  to dump them in exchange for their support. He refused.
Berlusconi, 57, is a billionaire media baron turned political novice. He  leads a right-wing coalition that dominated late March elections which also  confirmed the demise of corruption-tainted traditional parties like the  Christian Democrats and Socialists.
The coalition allies of his Forza Italia party are the neo-fascist  National Alliance and the federalist Northern League.
If Berlusconi had failed to muster the needed votes in the Senate, his  government would have collapsed, forcing President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to ask  him either to form another one or call new elections that could plunge the  country into another crisis.
