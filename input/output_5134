Controversial French entrepreneur and politician  Bernard Tapie will fight a demand to pay off a debt of 1.2 billion francs (220  million dollars) to state-owned Credit Lyonnais, his lawyer says.
The lawyer, Francis Bousquet, said he had served papers for a hearing with  a Paris court Monday in an attempt to block the bank's move.
The move was designed to show the validity of an agreement signed on March  13 in which the bank agreed to accept repayment of Tapie's debts over a  five-year period, he said.
Credit Lyonnais, which has backed the flamboyant entrepreneur for more  than 15 years, has demanded he pay off 450 million francs by Thursday or face  court action.
The bank on Saturday issued a summons to claw back 100 million francs  (17.25 million dollars) of money owed to it by a company belonging to Tapie  and on May 17 instigated a series of legal moves aimed at recouping its money.
The bank then served two writs aimed at forcing Tapie to hand over at  least 350 million francs or face the sequestration of assets including  furniture and works of art.
Sources close to Tapie said he would be seeking damages over the distress  caused to him, his family and his firms for the "considerable prejudice" they  said the bank had shown in initiating procedures against him and releasing  them to the media.
Tapie additionally faces two new demands to strip him of his parliamentary  immunity to facilitate investigations against him.
Tapie already faces litigation which could see him lose his home,  furniture and works of art as well as a mansion he owns in Paris and a luxury  yacht as fraud and embezzlement investigations are stepped up.
Undeterred, he is going ahead with a campaign to become a European deputy  at next month's elections to the European Parliament and heads a list for a  centre-left splinter party.
