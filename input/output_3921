When the world's number-one player meets the world's  top junior -- he has to work overtime.
That's what top-seed Pete Sampras found when he faced qualifier Marcelo  Rios of Chile on the Roland Garros centre-court for a place in the third round  of the men's singles Wednesday.
Sampras eventually clinched a 7-6, (7/5), 7-6 (7/4), 6-4 victory in two  and a half hours.
But the 5ft 9in (1m75) Rios, 18 and from Santiago, gave an excellent  account of himself and Sampras needed to step up a gear to reach a third round  match against either Lars Jonsson of Sweden or Paul Haarhuis of the  Netherlands.
Sampras is chasing an elusive mid-season Grand Slam following his  victories at last year's Wimbledon and the United States Open and this year's  Australian Open.
