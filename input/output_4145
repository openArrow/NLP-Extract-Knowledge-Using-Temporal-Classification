Seven valuable icons from the 16th and 17th  centuries worth an estimated four million dollars were stolen from a museum in  the village of Ustyuzhna, north of Moscow, the Russian newspaper Izvestia  reported Thursday.
The icons were taken from a museum located in the Our Lady of the Nativity  cathedral which could not afford to pay for security guards, the report said  without specifying when the theft occurred.
Icon theft has been on the rise in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet  Union and some experts claim as much as 80 percent of the country's icons have  been smuggled out of the country.
