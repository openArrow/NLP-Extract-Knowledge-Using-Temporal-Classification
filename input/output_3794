Israeli soldiers have been ordered to  be on maximum alert against being taken hostage in reprisal for the abduction  of a Moslem guerrilla chief, pro-Israeli radio reported Wednesday.
The commander of Israel's northern region, General Yitzhak Mordechai, said  Israel had "information that terrorists will try to kidnap soldiers" in  retaliation for the capture of Mustafa Dirani, said the Voice of the South,  run by the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia.
Israeli commandos snatched Dirani, leader of the pro-Iranian Resistance of  the Faithful group, from his home in Lebanon on Saturday in an attempt to  trace missing airman Ron Arad, whose plane was shot down over south Lebanon in  1986.
Mordechai did not elaborate but he said during a tour of Israel's  "security zone" in south Lebanon on Tuesday that Israeli soldiers were ordered  to be on maximum alert.
Israel has ordered its embassies abroad to tighten security and military  officials have said the army was ready for revenge attacks following threates  of retaliation from guerrilla organisations, including Hezbollah.
