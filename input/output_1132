US Senate Republican leader Bob Dole called  Monday for the immediate renewal of China's most favored nation trade status  and urged that the trade benefits no longer be linked to human rights issues.
"I do not support destroying our trade relationship only to discover that  we have alienated China, that China's behavior has not changed and that other  countries and other companies have taken our place in China," he said during a  address on the Senate floor.
President Bill Clinton, who is to decide by June 3 whether to renew  China's MFN, has said that Beijing must make significant progress on its human  rights record before he will consider the extension.
The Republican leader acknowledged that China's rights abuses were  "appalling" but said Clinton "should candidly say what most of us have known  for a long time: tying trade to human rights doesn't work."
He added that there were other US priorites vis a vis China, particularly  in the area of nuclear proliferation and argued that revoking the trade  benefits, which give China the lowest tariffs on its exports, would cost US  jobs and US business opportunities.
As an alternative to trade sanctions, Dole recommended forming a human  rights commission to monitor China's abuses and a review of US support for  lending by international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the  International Monetary Fund.
