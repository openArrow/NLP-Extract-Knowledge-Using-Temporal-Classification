Rwandan rebels took control Monday of part of the  road leading from the capital Kigali to Gitarama, a town to the southwest  where the interim government has taken refuge, rebel radio said.
The seizure of the stretch of highway, where a mercy mission convoy with a  French former government minister aboard came under rebel fire on Sunday, was  confirmed to AFP by the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR), contacted  from Nairobi.
Radio Muhabura, mouthpiece of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), confirmed  rebels fired on the convoy because government soldiers were riding on the  lorries. Former humanitarian affairs minister Bernard Kouchner and his party  were forced to seek cover in a ditch.
A general staff officer in the Rwandan armed forces denied, however, that  rebels have taken part of the highway. "The road is open," he told AFP on  Monday.
UNAMIR spokesman Abdul Kabia said Rwanda's interim government was in  Gitarama. The cabinet was formed when the central African highland nation  plunged into mass bloodshed after president Juvenal Habyarimana died in a  suspect rocket attack on his plane on April 6.
Relief agencies and the US government estimate some 200,000 Rwandans have  been died in wholesale slaughter in the latest round of massacres among  minority Tutsis, who dominate the RPF, and the majority Hutus. Most of the  victims are said to be Tutsis and Hutus opposed to the interim government.
Habyarimana last year cut a peace deal with the RPF which is now in  tatters, and angered Hutu hardliners with a plan to bring the rebels into a  broad-based government.
