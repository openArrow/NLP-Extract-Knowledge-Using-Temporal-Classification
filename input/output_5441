Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of presidential  elections annulled in Nigeria last June, has again vowed to form a government  in the near future, defying the military regime.
In an interview with the magazine News published Monday, Abiola called on  the junta of General Sani Abacha to stand down and said "I am fully ready to  claim the mandate. I am ready for the worst."
"Nobody can stop me," the millionaire businessman from the Yoruba  southwest said in a separate interview with Concord magazine. "We are dealing  with people who are looters. They are not leaders. They are dealers and they  must go."
A newly formed nationwide group of anti-government movements, the National  Democratic Coalition (NADECO), has told the government to hand over to Abiola  by Tuesday, May 31, but the regime dismissed this as a "joke".
The military warned that it would tolerate no hindrance of its own plans  for restoring civilian rule, beginning with a constitutional conference it  plans for June 27. It has not detailed its programme for change any more than  Abiola said how he planned to organise his "government of national unity."
NADECO and other pro-democracy movements called for a boycott of  elections of delegates to this conference and few voters turned out in the  last round on May 23, but observers said turnout was higher in Saturday's  second round. No official indication of the outcome of the poll has been  released.
In his interviews, Abiola personally critised Abacha, who seized power in  November last year.
"Who is Abacha? The man didn't even pass the staff college," Abiola said.  "Professionally, he shouldn't even have been a lieutenant-colonel. You do not  become a lieutenant-colonel unless you have passed the staff college."
"You heard him read the budget (in January)," the presidential hopeful  added. "It was obvious he didn't understand what he was reading. How can a  nation of brilliant people like Nigeria be led by a man like that?"
Abiola was said on unofficial results comfortably to have won the June 12  poll, hailed as free and fair by international observers, until then junta  leader General Ibrahim Babangida annulled it, alleging irregularities.
Babangida stepped down in August, handing over to an unelected civilian  caretaker administration. It was this government that Abacha overthrew, going  on to scrap all Nigeria's democratically elected institutions.
