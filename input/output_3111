British Airways, Britain's biggest airline, on  Monday announced a 63 percent hike in annual pre-tax profits to 301 million  pounds (451.5 million dollars) compared with 185 million pounds for the  previous year.
The results, for the year to March, were in line with analysts'  expectations of between 295 and 307 million pounds.
Sales rose 13 percent to 6.3 billion pounds from 5.6 billion pounds the  previous year, while the number of passengers grew by 8.9 percent to a total  of 30.6 million.
In the two main London airports, Heathrow and Gatwick, BA's share in the  market grew by three percent to 46 percent.
Earnings per share rose to 31.3 pence from 23.1 pence, while the dividend  increased to 11.1 pence from 10.16 pence.
Chairman Sir Colin Marshall said the rise in pre-tax earnings reflected  the company's initiatives to reduce costs and increase revenues, particularly  in the premium sector where the airline's 100 million pound programme of  improvement to Club World, First Class and Concord helped increase premium  traffic by six percent.
