Somali bandits shot dead five Nepalese  peacekeepers near Mogadishu's United Nations-controlled airport Monday, a UN  spokesman said.
Two Somalis were also wounded in the shootout, which brought the number of  UN soldiers killed in Somalia to more than 80 since the world body took over  the military intervention in the Horn of Africa country from the United States  in May 1993, spokesman Huntley Anderson said here.
Mogadishu has slid deeper into chaos since the last American soldiers  pulled out last month, leaving the UN with an essentially Third World force,  mainly Pakistanis and Indians.
A squabble over territory led to pitched battles around the airport last  month between warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid's Habr Gedir clan and the Hawadle  clan that controlled the airport before the first Americans landed in December  1992.
General Aidid's clan disloged their rivals from houses around the airport,  prompting bloody retaliation by the Hawadle who killed up to 20 Habr Gedir  clansmen in central Somalia, according to Somali and UN sources.
UN officials in Mogadishu said they had suffered a wave of attacks and  ambushes since the Americans left.
"Security here is going from bad to worse," said one official who  requested anonymity.
The United Nations is meanwhile trying to bring Somalia's 16 warring  clan-based factions to the negotiating table in the Kenyan capital Nairobi.
The talks have been postponed several times but are now scheduled to open  around May 30, UN spokesman George Bennett said.
