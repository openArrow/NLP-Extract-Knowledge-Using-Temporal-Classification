The United States and Japan will announce the  results of their trade talks here on Tuesday, a senior Japanese official said.
"We will have an announcement tomorrow," said Japan's Deputy Foreign  Minister for Economic Affairs, Sakayuki Hayashi, as he emerged after almost  three hours of talks that extended past midnight Monday at the US Trade  Representative's office here.
But a senior Japanese official said that an agreement was "not finalized."
One of President Bill Clinton's economic advisers, Bowmen Cutter, said  "there will be a statement tomorrow," but refused to confirm if the two sides  had reached an agreement.
"There will be comments tomorrow," he said.
US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor did not take part in the talks late  Monday, but he said earlier that "it is conceivable" that the two sides could  bridge their differences.
The two sides are trying to agree on ground rules for resuming trade  negotiations which collapsed in February in disagreement over how to measure  progress in opening Japan's markets and reducing its 60 billion dollar trade  surplus with the United States.
The current talks were originally scheduled to last only a day, but as  they were repeatedly prolonged it became clear that the two sides were holding  substantive discussions.
The talks here have been punctuated by long breaks, apparently for the  Japanese side to consult with Tokyo.
Japanese news agencies reported late Monday that the United States and  Japan had reached "a broad accord" to resume the negotiations in the near  future.
The agreement would not include reference to numerical targets, the  Japanese reports said.
The talks collapsed in February because of US insistence on numerical  targets to measure progress in opening Japan's markets, something Tokyo  rejected as managed trade and leading to quotas.
