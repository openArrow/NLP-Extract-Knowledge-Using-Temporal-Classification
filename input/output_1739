Two conscripts have been arrested on suspicion of  causing a devastating blast at an arms depot in the Russian Far East which  destroyed 1,600 tonnes of weapons, the Russian prosecutor's office said  Wednesday.
The prosecution spokesman, quoted by the news agency Interfax, said that  one of the two was suspected of having dismantled a missile and withdrawing a  part, causing a short-circuit which set off a fire.
When they failed to contain the blaze, the two, who were doing their  military service on the base near the port of Vladivostok, allegedly fled.
Russian intelligence sources earlier Wednesday told ITAR-TASS agency that  a soldier had taken apart an electrical detonator stuffed with powder and  hurled it into dry grass near a stock of shells after it caught fire.
The blast on Saturday 100 kilometres (60 miles) from Vladivostok spread  over a 10-kilometres (six miles) radius where villages had to be evacuated.
No casualties were reported.
