Human Rights Watch/Asia sharply criticized Clinton's decision and  challenged his assessment of Beijing's progress.
"Far from improving, the overall human rights sitution has significantly  worsened in the year since the executive order was issued," said a statement  from the US-based rights group.
"President Clinton has effectively removed all pressure on China to  improve its human rights practices," said the group's director, Sidney Jones,  adding that the ban on gun exports was meaningless.
"Is a ban on guns going to persuade China to release jailed dissidents?  The only big winner from this decision is the Chinese government," he said.
