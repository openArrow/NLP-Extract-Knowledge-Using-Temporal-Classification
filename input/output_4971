All but three of the world's top-15 players have  agreed to represent their countries at this year's Federation Cup finals in  Frankfurt from July 18.
Steffi Graf and Anke Huber will once again spearhead the host's challenge  against defending champions Spain, who will have loyal regulars Arantxa  Sanchez and Conchita Martinez on duty.
Many other top stars have also answered their countries' calls to compete  in the event which, for the last time in its 32-year history, will be grouped  at one venue and over one week.
From 1995 a new, controversial 'home-and-away' Davis Cup-style format is  to be introduced.
Gabriela Sabatini has agreed to return for Argentina and will join forces  with fast-progressing Ines Gorrochategui, while Mary Pierce and Nathalie  Tauziat turn out for France, alongside Julie Halard and Sandrine Testud.
A strong Japanese team will be headed by Kimiko Date and Naoko Sawamatsu,  while Australia, always a side to be reckoned with, field an unchanged line-up  from their unseeded team which caused so many upsets to reach last year's  final.
The United States, who have named Mary Joe Fernandez, Lindsay Davenport,  Zina Garrison-Jackson and doubles specialist Gigi Fernandez will effectively  have only one reserve in their team -- Patti Fendick. The other reserve, named  before her recent arrest on drugs charges to keep open her Olympic option, was  Jennifer Capriati.
