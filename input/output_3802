The British chemicals group Courtaulds on Wednesday  announced a 34.7 percent drop in annual pre-tax profits at 121.6 million  pounds (182.4 million dollars) compared with 186.2 million pounds the previous  year.
The results, for the year to March, were in line with analysts'  expectations.
Sales were virtually unchanged at 1.952 billion pounds from 1.951 billion  pounds the previous year.
The dividend lifted slightly to 14.8 pence from 14 pence, while earnings  per share were down at 20.3 pence from 35.7 pence the previous year.
Chief executive Sipko Huismans said Courtaulds was starting the year from  a lower cost base in all business areas, with productivity "markedly higher"  than a year ago.
"We have started seeing the beginnings of recovery in a number of our  major markets, particularly in Europe, which experienced difficult trading  conditions for most of 1993," he said.
He said that in years to come there would be material benefits from the  April merger of Hoechst's viscose and acrylic businesses with those of  Courtaulds.
Courtaulds said it took an exceptional charge against operating profit of  49.7 million pounds, which was partly offet by exceptional gains on disposals  of 25.1 million pounds.
The exceptional restructuring charge was due to the rationalisation of  coatings and sealants facilities principally in Europe and North America.
Shares rose five pence to 532 on the London Stock Exchange.
