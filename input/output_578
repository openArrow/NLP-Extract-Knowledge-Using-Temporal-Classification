The highest US military decoration  will be awarded to two soldiers killed in Somalia last year, President Bill  Clinton said Saturday.
Sergeants Gary Gordon and Randall Shughart will be posthumously decorated  with the Medal of Honor during a White House ceremony May 23 -- the first time  the medal will have been awarded since the Vietnam War.
The soldiers were killed while attempting to reach other Army Rangers who  were critically wounded when their helicopter was downed in Mogadishu in  October, according to a White House statement.
The two came under heavy fire from forces loyal to Somali warlord Mohammed  Aidid as they fought their way through a dense maze of shacks in Mogadishu,  armed only with rifles.
They ran out of ammuntion and were fatally wounded but managed to deliver  a rifle to the helicopter pilot who then reached safety.
"By their extraordinary heroism, Sergeants Gordon and Shughart managed to  save the pilot's life," said the statement issued in Indiana, where Clinton  attended a Democratic governors' convention.
The Medal of Honor is awarded for "conspicuous gallantry and intrepidy at  the risk of live above and beyond the call of duty in action with the enemy."
