South Africa's new 90-member Senate met for the  first time here Friday and elected as its president the National Party's  former justice and defense minister, Kobie Coetsee, 63.
Coetsee ran unopposed. After they were sworn in, the senators -- 10 from  each of the country's nine new provinces -- elected African National Congress  (ANC) stalwart Govan Mbeki as deputy president of the upper house.
Mbeki, 84, father of President Nelson Mandela's first deputy head of state  Thabo Mbeki, was one of the defendents at the Rivonia Trial that saw Mandela  and seven other ANC leaders sentenced to life terms in 1964 on charges of  sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government.
The only parliamentary body still to be officially formed after the  country's first democratic election last month remains the Constituent  Assembly -- a body comprising the Senate and the 400-member National Assembly  that will give the country's new constitution its final shape over the next  five years.
The joint body will hold its first meeting on Tuesday, parliamentary  sources said, and elect a chairman, widely expected to be Pravin Gordhan, 44,  a chief ANC negotiator at the multiparty negociations that drew up South  Africa's interim constitution.
The Senate, whose members were chosen by the provincial assemblies,  comprises 60 ANC members, 17 from the National Party, five each from the Zulu  nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party and the white right-wing Freedom Front and  three from the liberal Democratic Party.
The Constituent Assembly meeting will be held before Mandela opens the  lower house's working session with a state of the nation address on Tuesday  afternoon, to be followed by a four-day debate.
The assembly will then recess until June 20, when it will reconvene to  pass the national budget by July 10, then recess again to reopen in August,  parliamentary sources said.
