Lung cancer will overtake breast cancer as the  leading cause of cancer death among Canadian women this year, a government  agency reported Monday.
Lung cancer will remain the leading cause of cancer death among men,  Statistics Canada said, although the rate of lung cancer among men is holding  steady while more women are dying from it.
The government agency said that in 1994 an estimated 121,300 new cases of  cancer will be diagnosed in Canada and there will be an estimated 61,000  deaths due to cancer.
This represents a 36 percent increase in both figures since 1984.
More men will be hit by cancer accounting for 53 percent of all new cancer  cases diagnosed this year and 55 percent of all cancer deaths.
Among women, lung cancer will account for 5,600 deaths, compared to 5,400  deaths due to breast cancer;
Among men, lung cancer will be the cause of 11,000 deaths -- or roughly  one-third of all male cancer fatalities this year.
The second highest cause of cancer death among men, prostate cancer, will  account for 4,100 mortalities this year, said Statistics Canada.
