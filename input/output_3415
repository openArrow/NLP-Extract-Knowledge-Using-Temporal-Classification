The Chinese media did not announce Tuesday the two  prizes won by Zhang Yimou's film "To Live" at the Cannes film festival.
The movie took the Grand Jury's award along with Nikita Milkhalkov's  "Burnt by the Sun." The best actor award went to "To Live" star Ge You.
But the official Xinhua agency, radio and television all kept quiet about  the prizes Tuesday morning.
The Chinese authorities were angered because "To Live" was shown without  being approved by the official censor. Zhang, 43, was prevented from going to  the festival opening.
"To Live," co-produced with Taiwan money, tells the story of a Chinese  family from 1940s through the Cultural Revolution and does not present the  glorious image of communist China the authorities prefer.
Zhang has had several movies censored by the authorities in the past. But  last year he was awarded China's two highest awards for his movie "The Story  of Qiu Jiu."
