Kawasaki Steel Corp., the only big Japanese  steelmaker not to curtail capital spending this year, announced Friday plans  to streamline its steel activities while cutting its number of board members  by six.
The company said it would realign its four steel divisions into a  production and development division and a sales and planning division from  July.
The board will be reduced from 34 to 28 by eliminating the posts of vice  chairman, cutting the number of vice presidents and senior managing directors  from three to two and lowering the number of other directors from 15 to 12.
Kawasaki Steel, which along with other Japanese steelmakers has been  crippled by the strong yen, has forecast a pre-tax loss of 32 billion yen (310  million dollars) for the year to last March.
While its rivals announced plans last month to slash capital investment  this year, Kawasaki said spending would rise from 135 billion yen to 170  billion yen because of existing commitments under a five-year plan to  modernise a mill.
