Indirect trade between Taiwan and China in the  first quarter of 1994 edged up 7.42 percent from a year ago to hit 2.01  billion US dollars, the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said Monday.
However, the pace of two-way trade growth slowed compared with 1992's  first quarter increase of 37.93 percent and a 24.87-percent jump registered in  the corresponding period of 1993, the government agency said.
Chuang Cheng-yuan, in charge of the statistics section of the BOFT,  attributed the slowdown to the Chinese authorities' levying a value-added tax  on import commodities that started January 1.
The booming trade across the Taiwan Strait was mainly triggered by  increased China-bound investment by the island's manufacturers.
Up to 10,000 Taiwan enterprises have injected some 13 billion US dollars  in the mainland for various projects with or without government approval.
Exports to the mainland in the January-March period climbed 7.2 percent to  1.75 billion dollars, while imports jumped 8.89 percent to 266 million  dollars, the BOFT said.
The quarterly indirect trade, mainly conducted through Hong Kong,  accounted for some five percent of Taiwan's overall trade in the period, with  the export-oriented island enjoying a 1.48-billion-dollar surplus, it added.
Following a 20.2 percent decline posted in February, the March indirect  trade amounted to 796 million dollars, a 12.43 percent advance over the same  period of 1993, it added.
Synthetic yarns and cloth shared 29.59 percent of Taiwan's exports to  China, followed by mechanical equipment, the BOFT said, adding that herbs led  the import lists.
The ruling Kuomintang, driven off the mainland by the communists in 1949,  has banned direct contacts across the Taiwan Strait.
