A German tourist was shot and killed  Monday while walking in the southern California mountains during an apparent  robbery which also left her husband wounded.
The woman was found dead near where the couple had pulled off the road in  the San Jacinto mountains for a brief stroll. Her husband, who had managed to  return to the car and drive a short way for help, was flown to a hospital for  surgery.
"We believe the motive was robbery," said sheriff's deputy Mark Lohman.
The alarming rise in attacks against tourists in the United States has  prompted warnings against US travel.
A recent study showed a drastic decline in the number of Japanese visitors  to California, where foreigners fear earthquakes, riots and fires as well as  crime.
