Izetbegovic said on television late Monday he "did not know" whether he  would attend this week's talks in Geneva on a suspension of hostilities in  Bosnia because of the continued non-respect by Serb forces of an ultimatum  last month that ordered them out of the Gorazde region.
"I don't know because the Serbs have still not withdrawn their troops from  the Gorazde exclusion zone, which was our condition for the resumption of the  talks on a cessation of hostilities," he said.
The UN Protection Force in Bosnia has noted the continued presence of  around 150 armed Serbs within the three-kilometre (two-mile) exclusion zone,  despite the threat of airstrikes by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation if  they were not withdrawn.
Izetbegovic said that "maybe someone else will go (to Geneva), but it is  still too soon to talk about it."
