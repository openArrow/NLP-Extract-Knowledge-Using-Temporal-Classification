Chinese dissident Chen Ziming, one of the  leading figures during the 1989 pro-democracy movement, was released from  prison Friday to receive medical treatment, the official Xinhua news agency  reported.
Chen, a 40-year-old economist and publisher of the reformist Economic  Weekly, was sentenced to 13 years in jail in February 1991 for "conspiring to  subvert the government and "counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement."
Chen's release follows that of five Christians from re-education camps, as  well as the release of two other dissidents on Thursday, in what appears to be  moves to persuade US President Bill Clinton to extend China's  most-favored-nation trade status.
Chen "has been released on bail for medical treatment today with the  permission of the Chinese judicial authorities," Xinhua said, monitored here.
The sentence handed down on Chen was one of the heaviest for any leader of  the 1989 movement which culminated in the Tiananmen Square massacre of June 4.
Chen, who came from the eastern province of Zhejiang, was director of the  private Beijing Social-Economic Research Institute as well as a contributor to  the Economic Weekly.
During his period of detention in Qincheng prison, Chen had secretly  written a book on the history of China since the launching of reforms by  paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in 1978. The manuscript was smuggled out of the  prison and published in Hong Kong.
Chen was eighth on the "most-wanted criminals" list issued by the public  security ministry in 1989. The six poeple who headed the list either managed  to flee China or were allowed to leave by the authorities, such as  astrophysicist Fang Lizhi and his wife Li Shuxian.
