North Korea is continuing to discharge used  fuel rods from a reactor in Yongbyon, worsening the controversy over  Pyongyang's nuclear program, diplomatic sources said Friday.
The latest talks in Pyongyang with an official of the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) on the discharge of the reactor apparently ended in  failure, the sources said.
IAEA director general Hans Blix is likely to provide a report on the  problem to the UN Security Council later Friday or early Saturday at the  latest.
