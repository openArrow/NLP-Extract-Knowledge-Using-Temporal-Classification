Syrian President Hafez al-Assad persuaded Lebanese  Prime Minister Rafic Hariri to resume his duties after a week-long boycott of  government meetings in a row over a planned cabinet reshuffle, a source close  to the premier said Saturday.
Hariri froze his duties last Sunday, angry that plans to increase the  number of Christians in his cabinet had been blocked by President Elias Hraoui.
But after a three hour meeting with Assad in Damascus, Hariri was  persuaded to return to his duties, the source added.
A cabinet meeting is due to be held Monday to confirm Hariri's decision.
The issue of a cabinet reshuffle will be discussed with Syrian leaders  after a visit by US Secretary of State Warren Christopher due to begin Sunday,  the source added.
