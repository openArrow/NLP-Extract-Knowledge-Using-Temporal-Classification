Canada's Paul Tracy crashed here  Friday during practice for Indianapolis 500 pole qualifying, dimming chances  of a front-row sweep by the Mercedes-powered Penske team.
Tracy spent Friday night at Methodist Hospital following neurological  tests and X-rays after he lost control of his car at 240 mph (384 km/h) in the  third turn. Tracy was listed in good condition with a concussion and bruised  left foot but is questionable for qualifying.
Record speeds and a crowd of more than 200,000 people are expected  Saturday at the 2.5-mile (4km) oval for time trials despite forecasts of  late-day rain.
Rookies Hideshi Matsuda of Japan and Canada's Jacques Villeneuve won the  first spot in the qualifying line in a blind draw. Reigning Indy champion  Emerson Fittipaldi of Brazil was next-to-last in the order, just ahead of 1993  Indy pole winner Arie Luyendyk of the Netherlands.
Tracy's primary car suffered extensive damage, but his backup car was  tested late Friday and could be ready if Tracy was declared fit to drive.
"Paul should be driving tomorrow," said Fittipaldi, Tracy's teammate. "We  still aren't sure what happened. But the backup car is ready. I tested it at  225 mph (360 km/h)."
Tracy, Fittipaldi and 1992 Indy winner Al Unser Jnr were favored to sweep  the front berths in the 33-car field for the May 29 race. All three Roger  Penske team drivers use the new Mercedes motor, which has extra boost over  conventional Indy-car engines thanks to a loophole in rules for this race  alone.
"I'm not a betting man, but I know who is going to get the pole," said  reigning series champion Nigel Mansell. "Penske is going to run away with it."
