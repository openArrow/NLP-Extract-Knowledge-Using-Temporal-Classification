Switzerland's Tony Rominger created history here on  Sunday by clinching a hat-trick of Tour of Spain triumphs.
The 1992 and 1993 winner also gave world number one Miguel Indurain the  perfect reminder that this year's Tour de France will be a major confrontation  between the two.
But Indurain, just one week before the Tour of Italy, refused to give  Rominger a psychological edge by immediately responding in kind, winning the  Tour de l'Oise at Senlis in France.
Frenchman Laurent Jalabert won the 165km 21st and final stage between  Palazuelos and Madrid to record his seventh stage victory, one more than  Rominger, who led the event from the first day.
Spaniards Mikel Zarrabeitia and Pedro Delgado shared the podium with the  33-year-old rider, with the Swiss rider's margin of victory -- 7min 28secs --  the biggest in the event since 1960.
Rominger admitted: "It was one of the easiest victories of my career."
Indurain wrapped up the four-stage Tour de l'Oise by winning a final 12km  time trial, averaging 47.937km to edge out Frenchman Eddy Seigneur by 5secs  and Britain's Chris Boardman, the former world one hour record holder, by 12.
