Former England captain Graham Gooch is back as  world number two batsman, without even playing.
Gooch, 40, was removed from the world ratings last winter after making  himself unavailable for England's West Indies tour.
But now is fully available again, he has been reinstated by the ratings'  sponsors.
However the Essex giant, who returned to the England team at number four  in the one day international against New Zealand on Thursday, is 100 points  behind West Indian Brian Lara in first place.
Darren Gough, England's new-found fast bowler, has a mystery side injury  and is almost certain to miss Saturday's second one day international against  the Kiwis.
Gough, 23, took the wickets of star batsman Martin Crowe and top scorer  Bryan Young with some impressive pace, dotted with Waqar Younis-style yorkers,  in England's 42 run win at Birmingham.
England chairman of selectors Ray Illingworth said on Friday: "At the  moment there's a lot of doubt about him playing because these sort of side  injuries are not usually shaken off in a couple of days."
