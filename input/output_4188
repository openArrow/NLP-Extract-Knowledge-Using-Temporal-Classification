ATP tour officials have slapped a 1,500 dollar fine  on Andre Agassi for his four letter outbursts during his second round loss to  Thomas Muster on Tuesday.
The American, who was beaten in five sets but played some of his most  inspirational tennis since his 1992 Wimbledon win, was warned for verbally  abusing umpire Bruno Rebeuh and then docked a penalty point for an audible  obscenity in the fifth set.
