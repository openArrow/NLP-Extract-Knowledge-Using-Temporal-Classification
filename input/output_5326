South Korea's accumulated current account deficit  widened to 2.8 billion dollars in the first four months of the year, the  central Bank of Korea (BOK) said Monday.
The four-month figure was 3.4 times the 822 million dollar shortfall  recorded during the same period of last year.
In April alone, South Korea chalked up a 257.9 million dollar current  account deficit, improved sharply from the 672.3 million dollars deficit in  March but far worse than last year's 41.8 million dollar deficit.
The April provisional current account figure broke down to a 178.5 million  dollar trade deficit, a 103.8 invisible trade deficit and a 24.4 million  dollars surplus in transfers.
The expanded current account deficit was attributed to the aggravated  trade balance, which registered a 3.01 billion dollar deficit during the  January-April period, as exports rose by 10.7 percent while imports climbed up  to 14.1 percent, a BOK official said.
By category, imports of capital goods such as machinery, precision  equipment and electronics soared 21 percent, boosted by the nations's  increased facility investments, and imports of consumer goods leapt by 16.2  percent during the period.
BOK officials said concern over the fluctuation of international prices of  raw materials accelerated the buying trend of Korean importers.
