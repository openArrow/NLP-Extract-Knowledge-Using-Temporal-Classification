UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Jose Ayala  Lasso made an impassioned plea Friday for the world to end the "unimaginable  human tragedy" in Rwanda.
"The world must do something to halt this violence," said Ayala Lasso, who  arrived in Europe Thursday from five days in Kigali, where he met with the  chiefs of the Hutu-led government army and the mostly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic  Front.
He obtained assurances from the government army that several thousand  civilians held captive in the capital would be freed soon.
He said he had asked the warring parties to guarantee the safe delivery of  humanitarian aid, but added: "the international community must really commit  itself to putting pressure on this country."
Ayala Lasso said the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis had both welcomed  his proposal to set up a commission to determine the causes of the massacres  which have left some 200,000 dead in the tiny highland central African state,  and responsibility for them.
The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees meanwhile said that  with US planes now operating an airbridge taking aid to some 250,000 Rwandan  refugees in Tanzania had intensified, and was flying in plastic sheeting for  shelters.
Some 2,000 refugees are continuing to cross the border each day, said  spokesman Ron Redmond.
In Paris, foreign ministry spokesman Richard Duque said France had asked  the United Nations to ensure that UN troops in Rwanda protect refugees  sheltering in the Milles Collines Hotel in Kigali, saying they had been  threatened.
France supported a proposal by UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for beefing up the UN troop strength in Rwanda, he said, and it appeared the  warring parties had agreed to this.
Theogene Rudasingwa, the secretary general of the Patriotic Front,  meanwhile told a press conference in Johannesburg that he was "shocked" that  France should refuse to support "the real democratic forces of the Rwandan  opposition" rather than the government, which was behind the "massacre of the  Tutsis."
