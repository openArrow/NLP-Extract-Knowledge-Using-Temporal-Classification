Russian special forces units late Thursday gave  arms and drugs to four men holding 13 mostly female hostages aboard a bus at  Mineralnye Vody, southern Russia, interior ministry sources said.
The commando units took the weapons and materials the hostage-takers  demanded in return for releasing most of the 50 hostages they had seized  earlier in the day, the source said.
The security forces delivered four sub-machineguns, a grenade launcher,  four bullet-proof vests, night-sights and a portable television set, the  source said.
Police had previously also provided the hostage-takers with phials of  morphine, security forces said.
The arms had been "prepared" by the interior ministry but the bullet-proof  vests were real, the source said. Television news broadcasts were being  "filtered."
The gunmen hijacked the bus near the town of Mineralnoye Vody Thursday  afternoon as it travelled from the North Ossetian city of Vladikavkaz en route  to the southern Russian city of Stavropol.
The authorities allowed it to approach the town's airport, where officials  earlier said some 800 troops were deployed.
The hostage-takers released the 15 children they were holding along with  23 men, in a operation staggered over several hours, Stavropol police chief  General Ivan Tetereviatnikov told AFP by telephone.
No decision had been taken concerning the kidnappers' demand for a  helicopter to enable them to flee, he added.
Meanwhile the Moscow Echo commericial radio station, in a report monitored  by the Interfax news agency, said an "operation to release the hostages and  disarm the criminals is planned to begin after dark."
The station gave no details of the operation.
