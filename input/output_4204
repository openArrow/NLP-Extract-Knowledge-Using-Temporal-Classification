The announcement made good on an earlier Sino-US memorandum on market  access, as talks continue on China's bid to rejoin GATT in time to be a  founding member of its successor body, the World Trade Organization.
The fact that the restrictions have been lifted "ahead of schedule" shows  that China has the sincerity and the ability to fulfill its commitments to  GATT, Long said.
China, which was a founding member of GATT but left after the communist  party came to power in 1949, has repeatedly said it attaches great political  significance to being a founding member of the WTO.
Long's announcement came just two days before he heads a Chinese  delegation to Brussels and Washington for a fresh round of negotiations on  China's GATT membership with the European Union and the United States.
The timing of the latest import and quota cuts is clearly aimed at putting  pressure on the United States, which China views as the major obstacle to  early readmission.
In Hong Kong, GATT director general Peter Sutherland -- who had no direct  comment on the cuts -- told business leaders there was only a very slim chance  that China could accede to GATT by year's end.
"I'm not saying it's impossible... but it is a very demanding schedule,"  he said of the ongoing negotiations on China's membership bid.
Sutherland, who visited Beijing two weeks ago, also said Clinton's MFN  decision would have "an indirect bearing" on the talks, particular if the  trade status is revoked altogether.
