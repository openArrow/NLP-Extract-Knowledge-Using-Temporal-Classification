Mary Pierce took another impressive step towards a  possible semi-final showdown with Steffi Graf at the French Open here on  Wednesday when she produced another devastating performance to dismiss Italy's  Maria Francesca Bentivoglio.
Nick Bollietieri's latest star pupil, who is seeded twelfth, raced to a  6-0, 6-1 victory in just 56 minutes in her second round match.
In the next round Pierce will play either 24th-ranked Lori McNeil of the  United States or 64th-ranked Kristie Boogert of the Netherlands.
The 19-year-old Canadian-born Pierce, who lost only one game beating  experienced Nicole Provis of Australia in the first round, had a light  work-out with Bollietieri and her hitting partners in the early morning  drizzle which delayed the start of Championship play by just over an hour.
She has rarely looked more relaxed and will be hoping to improve on her  fourth-round loss last year in what is her fifth campaign at the Roland Garros  Stadium.
Against the 17-year-old Bentivoglio, at 233 the lowest-ranked player in  the women's draw, the 6ft (1m80) Pierce was overwhelming.
