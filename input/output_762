Hundreds of black-shirted Italian skinheads  chanting racist slogans and displaying swastika symbols held a rally Sunday in  the northern city of Vicenza, state television reported.
The rally, which authorities had allowed to go ahead, went off without  incident under the eye of police and paramilitary carabinieri units.
As well as shouting anti-foreigner and anti-republican slogans, the  neo-fascist youths, many tattoed with Nazi symbols carried banners portraying  journalists as "terrorists."
"Our ideas will never die, because they have a style -- the fascist  style," one skinhead told state broadcaster RAI.
Saturday's march came as Italy's neighbours were coming to terms with the  inclusion of five members of the neo-fascist National Alliance in the new  Italian government headed by media magnate Silvio Berlusconi.
Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini has qualified his movement as post-fascist  and described former Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini the "greatest  statesman of the century."
But he has repeatedly condemned the activities of the skinheads - whom  many Italians have nicknamed "Naziskins."
