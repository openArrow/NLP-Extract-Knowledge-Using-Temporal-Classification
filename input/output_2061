Disciplined Kiwi bowling pegged  England back after they had looked set to take control in the first one-day  cricket international here on Thursday.
Chris Pringle, finishing with five for 45, helped restrict England to 224  for eight wickets at the end of their 55 overs.
Probably the tourists' only real worry at the end of the England innings  was the loss of key strike bowler Danny Morrison, who had retired with a  hamstring strain after conceding 20 runs from his first three overs.
England captain Michael Atherton celebrated his return to one-day  international action in England after a three-year absence by hitting 81,  after his Kiwi counterpart Ken Rutherford had won the toss and put the hosts  into bat.
Atherton received strong early support from his deputy and fellow opener  Alec Stewart, who hit 24 from 30 balls, and after five overs England were 28  without loss.
But the Lancastrian apart, England's batting was disappointing and it took  a quickfire 19 from just 10 balls by Chris Lewis to give their total  respectability.
Atherton, who faced 137 balls and hit eight fours, played the anchor role  to perfection, despite being bogged down in mid-morning against left-arm  spinner Matthew Hart.
But a succession of partners came and went without asserting themselves.
Robin Smith took 14 overs making 15, while the recalled Graham Gooch,  coming in at number four, had 15 singles in his 23.
New wicketkeeper Steve Rhodes did hit Gavin Larsen for a straight six, but  then he and Dermot Reeve fell to Pringle in the space of three balls, both  skying attempted big hits.
New Zealand suffered an early setback with the loss of key opener Martin  Crowe for a duck with only two runs on the board.
From a ball by debutant Darren Gough, Crowe gave an outside edge to Alec  Stewart at slip.
After eleven overs the Kiwis had progressed to 36-1, with Bryan Young on  24 and young wicketkeeper Adam Parore on 12.
