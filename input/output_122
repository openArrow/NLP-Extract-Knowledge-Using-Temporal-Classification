An Iranian Jumbo jet with 60 tons of explosives  and raw materials for weapons landed in Zagreb May 4 in violation of a UN arms  embargo, The Washington Post reported Friday.
Two thirds of the shipment went to the Bosnian Moslems and the rest to  Croatia, the daily said quoting Western diplomats and Bosnian Moslem sources  in Sarajevo.
The delivery underscores the fragility of the September 1991 arms embargo  imposed by the UN Security Council on former Yugoslavia, and Iran's commitment  to Bosnia's outgunned Moslems.
News of the shipment came hours ahead of a meeting Friday in Geneva of  European, Russian and American foreign ministers on Bosnia, and the US  Senate's approval Thursday of a measure that would require Washington to  unilaterally lift the arms embargo against Bosnia.
President Bill Clinton, who could veto the measure should it be passed by  the House of Representatives, has called for a multilateral lifting of the  embargo to avoid undermining UN actions around the world.
The Iranian Boeing 747 unloaded 40 containers, marked "Humanitarian Aid,"  of explosives, fusing equipment and other raw materials for the production of  mortars and different types of ammunition, the Post said.
The material intended for the Bosnian Moslems was loaded on a convoy of  government trucks, the sources said.
"This is the first weapons-related convoy from the highest level since the  war began. It is a groundbreaker. We're hoping for more," a Bosnian military  source told the daily.
Western officials said the shipment adds to other foreign weaponry  smuggled into Bosnia, such as Brazilian assault rifles and a Chilean-made  anti-tank gun, from unknown sources.
The stream of weapons has improved the fighting capability of the Bosnian  Moslem forces, some of their officers said. "Tanks are not a problem for us  anymore," one high-ranking officer told the daily.
