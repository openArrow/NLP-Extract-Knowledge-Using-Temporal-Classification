European Union foreign ministers gave their  formal and unanimous endorsement here Monday to a new US-Russian-EU effort to  end the two-year war in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The decision followed an agreement in Geneva on Saturday between the  United States, Russia and five EU countries -- France, Britain, Germany,  Belgium and Greece -- to push for a four-month ceasefire and new negotiations.
"We all believe it will be a reasonable basis for ending the war," British  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said.
Meanwhile, EU mediator Lord Owen and his UN counterpart, Thorvald  Stoltenberg, left Geneva for Belgrade for discussions with Serb leaders.
And diplomats said the contact group for Bosnia -- comprising Americans,   Russians, Germans, French and Britons -- would meet in Washington for two days  this week to prepare for negotiations to implement the Geneva initiative.
Both Moslem and Serb leaders in Bosnia gave a chilly initial reception to  the initiative, which would give a proposed Moslem-Croat federation 51 percent  of Bosnia, and the Serbs 49 percent, down from the 70 percent they currently  hold.
The Moslems and Croats are claiming this is not enough. They want 58  percent, on the grounds that together the two groups make up 61 percent of the  population. However, the Serbs want to be left with more than 49 percent.
But French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said that the Geneva initiative  was the only realistic solution to the Bosnian conflict and that the EU had a  duty to keep pressing the combatants towards a negotiated settlement.
"If there is an accord, and if the Bosnian Serbs make the necessary  territorial concessions, the EU is disposed to phasing out economic sanctions  against Serbia," the French minister said.
Hurd added: "If there is an agreement, there will have to be a substantial  Serb withdrawal" from areas it has captured in Bosnia.
Special Russian envoy on ex-Yugoslavia Vitaly Churkhin said in Belgrade  that Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was ready for a ceasefire.
The Geneva initiative offers little that is new in comparison with an  accord between the warring parties negotiated in November 1993, which  subsequently fell apart.
But diplomats here reported intense relief among EU leaders that the United  States and Russia had this time accepted the principle of a 51-49 percent  division of Bosnia.
The EU foreign ministers also agreed on 32 million Ecu (37 million dollar)  in aid this year to finance the temporary administration of the southern  Bosnian city of Mostar.
Fighting between Croats and Moslems there has eased off over the past two  months as the two sides negotiated a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia,  brokered by the United States.
The EU-appointed administrator of Mostar, former Bremen mayor Hans  Koschnik, said he hoped to leave for the town next month with a team of up to  40 people.
Their mission, Koschnik said, was to help Mostar residents organise  themselves to overcome the effects of the Bosnian civil war.
Asked about their chances of success, he told journalists: "It is still a  better answer than letting people kill each other."
But Koschnik warned that a "cold war" situation of mistrust still existed  between the Croats and Moslems of Mostar.
