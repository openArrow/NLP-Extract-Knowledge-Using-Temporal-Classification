Jaguar Cars Limited have filed a  lawsuit against the National Football League claiming the new Jacksonville  Jaguars team logo is too similar to the automobile maker's pouncing cat.
The suit, filed in US District Court in New York, charges the NFL violated  trademark laws when they developed the logo.
"Quite frankly, I'm surprised they came up with the logo," said Jaguar  Cars spokesman John Crawford. "There is likely confusion among consumers  because of the similarity of the logo.
"We have nothing against the use of the name Jacksonville Jaguars," he  said, but added, "We vigorously pursue trademark infringement in Australia,  England, anywhere in the world."
The new team's logo has already been emblazoned on thousands of T-shirts,  bumper stickers and other merchandise.
A team spokesman said the club do not believe the symbol infringes on  Jaguar Cars' trademark. The NFL have yet to comment on the suit.
