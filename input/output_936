The UN Commission on Human Rights will meet next  week to discuss action regarding the bloodbath in Rwanda, where massacres have  claimed some 200,000 lives in five weeks, the United Nations announced Monday.
The special session of the commission, to be held on May 24 and 25, was  called by Canada on the recommendation of UN Commissioner for Human Rights  Jose Ayala Lasso, who visited the Rwandan capital Kigali last week.
The commissioner persuaded the Rwandan government army to allow safe  passage out of Kigali for tens of thousands of people effectively held captive  in their own capital by the strife, but was warned that this pledge would need  to be backed up by pro-government Hutu militias.
"The (Rwandan) leaders as well as those perpetrating these atrocities must  understand that their responsibility is inescapable and that they will have to  answer personally for their actions," Ayala Lasso said at the end of his visit.
The latest round of bloodshed in the central African highland nation,  prone to strife between the Tutsi minority and the Hutu majority, broke out  after Rwandan president Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in a suspected rocket  attack on his plane on April 6.
Thirty of the 53 countries on the UN commission have already expressed  backing for the Canadian request.
On Monday, the United Nations protested to rebels of the Tutsi-dominated  Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which is battling for control of Kigali, over  an attack on a mercy mission convoy Sunday.
The UN Security Council in New York is preparing to approve a call from UN  Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for the boosting of the strength of  the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) from 400 to 5,500.
UNAMIR, originally deployed to oversee implementation of a now-defunct  peace pact signed last year between the RPF and the government, was  drastically cut back when the latest slaughter began.
