A former member of the British elite SAS regiment  died from the effects of a bullet wound he received nearly 19 years before, a  coroner's inquest found Thursday.
Sergeant-major Tony Fleming was wounded in 1975 while his unit was aiding  the government of Oman against rebel forces. The bullet pierced his lung and  lodged in his spinal column, leaving him paralysed from the chest down.
Doctors gave him 10 years to live at most but he survived for almost twice  that, studying Arabic at university and returning to Oman to become a captain  of the sultanate's special forces.
He finally died of pneumonia in March after his condition suddenly  deteriorated. The inquest was held to establish that he had died of wounds  received on active service.
