A day after lawmakers extended Canada's  territorial maritime authority, Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin said foreign  fishing boats would be removed from the Grank Banks if they refuse to leave  within 30 days.
Tobin said Canadian authorities would enforce the new 200-mile limit to  protect the waters off Newfoundland, which have been threatened by decades of  overfishing.
"We're going to very clearly tell the vessels that we sight or target that  they either move or be moved," Tobin said. "We're saying to them, 'Move your  asset or lose your asset."
The House of Commons approved the 200-mile territorial limit Wednesday,  largely to protect the once-rich cod resources in the Grand Banks.
Tobin said coast guard, fisheries ministry and Royal Canadian Mounted  Police vessels would enforce the restrictions, particularly in the extreme  western sections of the Grand Banks, where foreign vessels cross.
