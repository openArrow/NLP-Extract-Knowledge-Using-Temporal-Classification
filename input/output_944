A three-member inspection team from the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived for a stopover in Beijing  Monday en route for a key visit to a suspected nuclear bomb factory in North  Korea, diplomats said.
The delegation, which will spend a day in China before leaving for  Pyongyang, is headed by Olli Heinonen of Finland, with Vladimir Rukhlo, a  Russian, and Jamaluddin Omar, a Tanzanian, they said.
The three will leave Beijing Tuesday afternoon aboard a North Korean  airliner.
North Korea announced on Saturday that it was beginning to replace fuel  rods at the Yongbyon nuclear site, 90 kilometers (54 miles) north of  Pyongyang, without the presence of IAEA monitors.
The IAEA, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, has insisted on viewing  the operation, saying it is vital for checking suspicions about North Korea's  nuclear programme. According to the United States, the procedure could free up  enough plutonium for at least four nuclear bombs.
The inspectors, who took part in a previous IAEA mission to North Korea in  March, are scheduled to return to China on May 24.
But the agency's spokesman, David Kyd, said Sunday that "if the reports  (of the refuelling) turn out to be correct, the inspectors will be immediately  recalled to Vienna."
