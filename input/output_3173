Sandoz had sales of 10.3 billion dollars in 1993 and had a net profit of  about 1.2 billion dollars which was 14 percent more than in 1923. Its  nutrition division had sales of 1.2 billion dollars of which 14 percent was  generated in the US market.
Last month the board of Sandoz had said that it expected 1994 to be  another good year. It announced an increase of one percent in sales in the  first quarter compared with the figure for the same period last year.
Sandoz president Marc Moret said that he was very satisfied with the deal.  "The transaction furthers our long-term strategy to meet the nutritional needs  of the consumers of today and tomorrow.
"Gerber is a unique company of the highest quality which will fit  perfectly as a cornerstone for this business in North America and complement  our strong nutrition business in Europe.
"We have been searching for and acquiring high value-added nutritional  products with market leadership positions to add to our portofollio.
"Gerber's excellent image and exceptional market strength in North America  give us a strong base in child nutrition on which we will expand  internationally."
Sandoz chief executive officer Rold Schweizer said: "Gerber's position in  North America strengthens our existing base of nutrition products there. This  geographic balance will provide a platform for dynamic growth.
"Gerber provides synergy for Sandoz with advanced technologies in  processing and packaging which we can apply in Europe and the Far East."
