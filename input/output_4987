Michael Chang's French Open jinx struck again on  Saturday when the 8th seed was dumped out of the competition by Peru's Jaime  Yzaga.
Chang, who because the youngest ever winner here in 1989 but has failed to  get past the quarter finals since, rallied brilliantly after being wiped off  court in the first two sets of the third round clash.
But he was unable to sustain it through the fifth and the Peruvian finally  clinched a 6-2, 6-3, 5-7, 1-6, 7-5 victory after 4h 21min on court.
With Yzaga striking his shots sweetly and finding the lines with  incredible regularity for the first hour and a half, it had looked as if they  would be on court for less than half that time.
But Chang pulled himself back into the match in a dramatic third set that  swung back and forth with nine breaks of serve.
He raced through the fourth and in the early part of the fifth seemed to  have the edge. But a netted forehand in the seventh game gave Yzaga a crucial  break.
The Peruvian went on to serve for the match at 5-4 only to be stymied by  yet another break by Chang.
But at 5-5 and 30-30 Chang fell heavily as he raced in vain to a Yzaga  drop shot. The American missed a straightforward backhand on the next point to  give Yzaga his second chance to serve for the match.
The Peruvian made no mistake this time, wrapping things up with a backhand  approach down the line that a weary Chang could only lunge desperately at.
Yzaga now plays another giant-killer, Magnus Larssson of Sweden, who beat  ninth seed Todd Martin, also in five sets.
