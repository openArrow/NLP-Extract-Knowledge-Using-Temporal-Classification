Southern leaders put forward a seven-point  plan Friday to end nine days of civil war in Yemen between rival north and  south forces, an official source said here.
The plan proposed by the southern Yemen Socialist Party, which is headed  by ousted vice president Ali Salem al-Baid, calls for an "immediate end to the  war" and the creation of a government of national unity.
