At 6:30 a.m. on D-Day a first wave of US soldiers  was to take the beach in Varreville and drive towards paratroopers who had  arrived inland overnight.
The problem: they landed two kilometres (1.2 miles) to the south at the  wrong beach.
The good break: it was a poorly defended site the men of the 4th infantry  division of the US 7th Corps under General J. Lawton Collins were able to take  quickly. On that June 6, 23,250 men landed at this beach, codenamed Utah,  bringing in 1,700 vehicles and 1,800 tons of material.
Nearby 225 Ranger commandos did the incredible. They scaled a cliff with  fire brigade ladders to secure the height called la pointe du Hoc. It was  defended by German troops and believed to house heavy artillery capable of  bombing allied ships. The battery, in concrete bunkers, was targeted by more  than 700 tons of bombs from allied planes and ships.
The Germans had however moved the guns back one kilometre (half-mile).
The Rangers took the point in 20 minutes, advanced to destroy the  artillery but then were alone for almost two days against a vicious Germany  counter-attack
Relief arrived on June 8. At that point there were 135 Rangers left alive  out of the original 225, and only 90 of them were still able to fight.
