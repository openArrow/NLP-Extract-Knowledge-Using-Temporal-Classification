A photographer filed a one million dollar lawsuit  against Michael Jackson Friday as a photographer claimed the pop star did  nothing to stop his bodyguards from beating him and taking his film.
Free-lance photographer Alex Oliveira alleges two Jackson bodyguards  attacked him in New York's Central Park March 31 as he tried to photograph the  pop superstar.
Oliveira filed the lawsuit in federal court, naming the bodyguards as  "John Does I and II."
According to Oliveira, one of the bodyguards told him to "give me the ...  film or I will break your neck." Then, said Oliviera, the bodyguards pushed,  choked and shoved him as they took his film and camera.
Oliviera alleged that Jackson failed to discipline, train or control his  bodyguards.
Oliviera contends he suffered severe and permanent injuries including  back, shoulder and neck pain, sleeplessness, anguish, and pychological and  emotional distress.
