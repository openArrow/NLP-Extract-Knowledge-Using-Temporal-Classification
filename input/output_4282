South Africa's annualised inflation rate,  measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), fell to 7.1 percent in April, the  lowest for more than 21 years, the official central statistical services (CSS)  said Thursday.
April's rate was 1.9 percent lower than March's 9 percent, CSS said.
The last time inflation in the country was at the seven-percent level was  in December 1972 when it hit a low of 6.9 percent.
CSS said that while there had been a rise in the price of food, this had  been offset by a drop in housing and transport costs.
Through restrictive monetary policies, the Reserve (central) Bank has  managed to reduce the CPI from a high of 15.3 percent in 1991.
In February last year the CPI hit a single-digit level, the first since  1978.
