Eleven French aid workers detained for over a  month by Bosnian Serbs on accusations of arms trafficking were released and  flown out of Sarajevo.
In Paris, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told parliament: "We have  been told by Sarajevo that our 11 Premiere Urgence hostages were freed,"  referring to the relief association which employed the group.
The 11 -- 10 men and one woman -- were driven from Serb-controlled  Lukavica where they had been held to Sarajevo airport and put on a helicopter  to be flown to a French vessel in the Adriatic Sea, military sources here said.
The group which had been held since April 8 accused of gun-running to the  Bosnian army left the Bosnian capital at 4:00 p.m. (1400 GMT).
They were expected back in France late Wednesday.
A spokesman for the UN Protection Force said they were "unconditionally"  handed over to the French ambassador in Bosnia-Hercegovina, Henri Jacolin, in  Lukavica.
Jacolin was accompanied by the French defense ministry aide  Jean-Christophe Ruffin, a doctor, and the foreign ministry's Louis-Michel  Fabre, also a doctor.
