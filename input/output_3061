The Haitian government issued a warning  Sunday against collaborating with "the enemy" while armed soldiers were out in  force in the capital.
Sources said that the Haitian army has been on a maximum state of alert  since Friday.
A statement from the Information Ministry warned that anyone with links to  "the enemy" aimed at helping them enter the country or infiltrate military  facilities would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
Any threats or attempts to bribe security forces would carry a mandatory  six-month sentence -- three years if the threats are directed at a legislator.
The warning comes after new, tighter trade sanctions were imposed on Haiti  in the latest effort to pressure Haiti's military to step aside and reinstate  ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
The statement did not define the enemy, but it comes amid stepped up  threats from the United States for a military intervention in crisis which  erupted when Aristide was deposed in 1991.
