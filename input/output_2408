Sarajevo marked its 100th day of a ceasefire to  the sound of steady gunfire Friday.
UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Rob Annink noted that between 100  and 200 violations of the truce were recorded daily.
The 100-day anniversary of the ceasefire agreement signed February 10 by  Bosnia-Hercegovina's warring parties was greeted overnight Thursday with "the  ususal ceasefire violations" in the capital consisting this time of heavy  machine-gun fire, the United Nations said.
The shooting lasted for more than an hour in the capital's Serb-held  downtown neighborhood of Grbavica.
Major Annink added, however, that the violations did not amount to a  breach of the 20-kilometre (12-mile) heavy weapons exclusion zone imposed by  the United Nations around Sarajevo.
He said the ceasefire violations were perpetrated with "rocket launchers,  hand grenades, mines, machine-guns and small arms," which, he added, "do not  pose a direct threat to the city."
But although the city itself may not be threatened by the continuous  violations, several of its residents seek treatement for bullet wounds at  local hospitals each day.
Soldiers from both camps -- the mainly Moslem Bosnian army and Bosnian  Serbs -- are also killed daily by sniper fire.
Although the UNPROFOR says that the exclusion zone forbidding heavy  weapons within a 20-kilometre (12-mile) radius around Sarajevo is generally  being respected, it admits to various violations in that area.
Annink said the Serbs had deployed six heavy guns inside the zone along  with several tanks which were not placed under UN control at various  collection centers.
The Serbs managed to sneak one of the tanks into Grbavica earlier this  month as it was being transported from Bosnian Serb headquarters at Pale.
Annink said the UNPROFOR did not believe the heavy weapons were a threat  to the city and preferred "negotiation to force" in resolving the matter.
In other developments Friday, Annink said the Bosnian army was continuing  its offensive along several fronts in central Bosnia.
He said UN peacekeepers counted 140 explosions Thursday in the region of  Kladanj, located midway between Sarajevo and the northern town of Tuzla.
The situation was also tense in the regions of Travnik and Turbe where  Annink said the Bosnian army burned a Roman Catholic church.
He did not have any further details on the incident, but Roman Catholicism  is the religion of Bosnia's Croats, who engaged in bitter fighting aginst  Moslem troops earlier in the war but recently reached an agreement to set up a  Moslem-Croat federation in the former Yugoslav republic.
The latest fighting came as several western countries threatened this week  to pull their troops out of ex-Yugoslavia unless there was a breakthrough in  the peace process.
France, Spain and Britain, together supply around 35 percent of the 33,253  UNPROFOR troops stationed in the former Yugoslavia.
