The British industrial gases and healthcare giant  BOC on Tuesday reported a sharp fall in interim pre-tax profits to 79.7  million pounds (119.55 million dollars) from 182.4 million pounds for the same  period a year earlier owing to restructuring costs.
BOC said it took a charge of 85 million pounds for fundamental  restructuring including 60 million pounds for its healthcare businesses and  the remainder for some of its larger gases companies.
The three-year programme, which began this year, is expected to produce  savings of 60 million pounds a year when complete, the company said.
Sales rose to 1.718 billion pounds from 1.594 billion pounds in the same  period a year earlier.
The dividend was unchanged at 11.6 pence, while earnings per share  plummeted to 3.65 pence from 23.55 pence.
The company said it had established a new industrial gases company in  Fushun, Liaoning Province in north-east China, bringing to seven the number of  BOC joint ventures in the country.
BOC said the new company, Fushun BOC Industrial Gases, had started  business on April 1 and was the result of a joint venture between Fushun Iron  and Steel Corp. and BOC.
Fushun had put its industrial gas business, one of the biggest in China,  into the joint venture, BOC said.
The managing director and chief executive of BOC Gases, C.K. Chow, said  the company was establishing a "very significant presence in China and one we  plan to extend further in the future."
