Three Australian drag queens caused a  sensation here late Saturday in the premiere of a film which brought immediate  comparisons to the surprise 1992 sensation "Strictly Ballroom."
The five-minute standing ovation accorded to the late-night screening of  "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" far exceeded that of any  other movie so far screened at the 47th Cannes International Film Festival.
"It's just like "Ballroom," said one Cannes regular, referring to the  Australian movie, also premiered here in a midnight screening, also in the Un  Certain Regard section of the festival, two years ago.
"Priscilla" -- a musical, like "Ballroom," which went on to be a massive  international hit -- tells the story of three drag queens travelling by bus  from Sydney to Alice Springs.
Along the way they bring the music of the likes of Gloria Gaynor, Village  People, and especially Abba, to various sets of aborigines and small town  hicks -- with varying reactions.
At the end of Saturday night's premiere the Theatre Claude Debussy in the  famous Festival Palace was still rocking to the strains of Abba's "Mamma Mia."
The premiere of the film, starring Terence Stamp, Hugo Weaving and Guy  Pearce, was attended by director Stephan Elliott and various other members of  the crew.
Elliott, whose first film "Fraud" appeared in competition here last year,  was not immediately available for comment, as he was swallowed up in the  late-night Croisette crowd.
