North Korea said Saturday it had begun refuelling a  controversial nuclear reactor before the arrival of inspectors from the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
"The replacement of fuel rods has begun at our five-megawatt experimental  nuclear power station according to its operational plan," a North Korean  foreign ministry spokesman told the official Korean Central News Agency.
The spokesman said the IAEA had refused to send inspectors to observe the  refuelling operation at the Yongbyong plant unless the fuel rods could be  sampled. Such tests would reveal the extent of North Korea's nuclear bomb  capability.
"Under such conditions, we had no choice but to remove the seals and start  taking out fuel rods for safety reasons," the spokesman was quoted as saying  by the news agency, monitored in Tokyo.
IAEA inspectors were due to leave Vienna on Sunday and arrive in North  Korea on Tuesday.
Agency spokesman David Kyd said in Vienna earlier that North Korea had  begun "preparations" for changing fuel rods at Yongbyong. He warned that the  inspectors would cut short the visit if the operation had reached a "critical  stage."
The North Korean official said "refuelling is taking place under the watch  of the cameras installed by the agency. So, there are no grounds for concern  about the diversion of the replaced fuel rods for another purpose."
