Southeast Asia's economically booming nations  will consider a common approach to fight efforts by the West to link trade and  workers' rights, a senior Malaysian official said Saturday.
ASEAN labour ministers will discuss "the adoption of a common approach to  thwart international pressure to comply with rigid labour standards," at a  two-day meeting beginning Monday in Singapore, Human Resources Minister Lim Ah  Lek said here.
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations comprises Brunei, Indonesia,  Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
"Malaysia would emphasise the need for developing countries to oppose the  rigid manner in which labour standards were likely to be imposed on them on  the basis of equality," Lim said in a statement to the Bernama news agency.
At a GATT ministerial conference in Marrakesh, Morocco last month,  developing countries voiced fears that a bid to include labour rights in the  new World Trade Organisation (WTO) could be used by industrial nations as a  pretext for new forms of protectionism.
This was in response to pressure, mainly from the United States and  France, for the linking of trade and workers' rights be put on the WTO agenda.
The WTO will replace the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT), which has operated on an interim basis since 1947, and will have  greater enforcement power in international trading relations.
