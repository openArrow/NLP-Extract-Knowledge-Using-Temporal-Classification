An Iraqi oil delegation is to visit Italy and the  Ukraine later this month to discuss cooperation, the Cyprus-based Middle East  Economic Survey (MEES) said Monday.
The delegation headed by oil ministry undersecretary Taha Humud is to hold  talks in Rome with Agip on "possible production-sharing agreements for the  southern Iraqi oilfields of Nassiriya, Halfaya and Dujaila."
The visit is "part of ongoing contacts betwen Agip and the Iraqi oil  authorities that have been underway for several months," MEES added.
The delegation's trip to Kiev would focus on the possible import of  supplies and equipment for the Iraqi oil industry as well as Iraqi crude  exports to Ukraine, after UN sanctions are lifted.
In February, Humud led a delegation to Paris where he discussed possible  upstream agreements with the Total and Elf Aquitaine companies. An Iraqi  delegation also travelled last month to Moscow.
Iraq is still under a UN oil and trade embargo imposed after its August  1990 invasion of Kuwait.
