One mistake cost Emerson Fittipaldi  everyhing he had worked for in the past month.
Fittipaldi crashed 16 laps from the finish while leading Sunday's 78th  Indianapolis 500, having dominated the race most of the day. His departure  allowed Al Unser Jnr to win for the second time in three years.
"I'm very disappointed," Fittipaldi said. "I was so close. I had  everything in control. I was a lap ahead with 50 laps to go and I never had so  fine a car."
The former Formula One and Indy-car series champion was trying to lap  second-place Unser when he went too low into the fourth turn and struck the  grooved concrete apron on the inner edge of the circuit.
"I went a little lower than Al was and when I hit the rumble strips, I  lost the back end," Fittipaldi said. "It just started sliding. I tried to  catch it. I nearly did it."
The rear of Fittipaldi's car slammed  into the outer concrete wall. The  rear wing shredded off and the car skidded to a stop on the main straightaway,  just short of the start-finish line.
Fittipaldi shook his raised hands in frustration as he sat helpless in the  cockpit. After leading 145 laps, his bid to become the first back-to-back Indy  500 winner in 23 years was over.
"I saw him hit the fence and I felt bad, for about half a second," Unser  said. "Emerson got caught in my turbulence. He got too fast out there and when  you get caught, it's like a vacuum cleaner pulling you out there."
