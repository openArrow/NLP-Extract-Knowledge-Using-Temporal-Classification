Labour's opposition shadow housing minister John Battle said: "Homeless  people in poverty are not street scroungers. It is totally depressing that the  social evils of homelessness and poverty are thriving in modern Britain.
"It is a favourite tactic to scapegoat the homeless as unwelcome beggars,"  he said.
Charles Kennedy, president of the Liberal Democrats, said Major's "attack  on homeless people is an absolute outrage. We can now conclude that it takes  one political down-and-out to spot another."
Tory MP Peter Bottomley, husband of Major's Health Secretary Virginia  Bottomley, said that while walking in central London Friday he offered to buy  a meal for someone begging for food.
"I bought him a hamburger, a coke and chips. But he had more money on him  than I did.
"Some people beg because they can make a fair amount of money, some people  do it because they are confused and need help," said Bottomley. "Some people  beg who are temporarily without a roof and with nothing to do.
