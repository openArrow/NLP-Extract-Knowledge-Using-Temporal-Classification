Doctors have begun an indefinite strike in Ghana's  state hospitals to press demands for payment of their overtime hours, press  reports said Wednesday.
Health Minister Steve Obimpeh on Wednesday called on nurses and other  hospital staff to take charge of the patients and to send the most serious  cases to military hospitals or clinics run by charities.
The pay of the doctors, who went on strike Tuesday, is aligned on the  salaries of other government workers.
