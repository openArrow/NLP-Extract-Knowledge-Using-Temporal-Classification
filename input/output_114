Japan will object to proposals to create a whale  sanctuary in the Antarctic because of its lack of scientific basis,  a  spokesman of the Fisheries Agency said Friday.
Kazuo Shima, head of Japan's delegation to the International Whaling  Commission (IWC) conference in Mexico May 23, said Tokyo would do its "utmost  to block the proposal."
And he warned, "If the proposal for the Antarctic sanctuary is adopted, we  will have to have a basic rethink about our relationship with the IWC."
Shima, who is also deputy director of the Japanese Fisheries Agency, said  other countries were likely to oppose the move, among them Norway, one of the  world's top whaling nations.
A ban on commercial whaling was adopted by the IWC in 1982 but not  enforced until 1986.  Norway and Japan want the ban lifted.
"The IWC's claim makes no sense," said the spokesman. "Statistics released  by the IWC's scientific division showed that some 760,000 Minke whales exist  in the Antarctic Ocean," he said.
The proposal for a whale sanctuary was originally submitted by France.
