Rival Kurdish factions battling in  northern Iraq on Tuesday denied seeking mediation from neighbouring Iran to  halt the month-long bloodshed.
"Iran asked us if we want them to mediate. We told them we are not against  that, but that they first have to declare whether they have participated in  the fighting," said a spokesman for the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).
The Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) said it had not asked for Iranian  mediation. "We are thankful for every peaceful initiative, but first we have  to settle this problem by ourselves," a KDP official said.
The Tehran press said last week that Iraqi Kurdish leaders had asked for  Iran's mediation in the fighting, must of which has taken place near the  Iranian border.
KDP and PUK officials met in Silopi, southeast Turkey, on Monday without  agreeing on an end to their clashes which have claimed more than 100 lives  since early May.
