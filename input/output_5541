Scot Colin McRae was controversially  thrown out of the Acropolis rally here on Monday after a bust-up with race  officials.
McRae, in second place behind Subaru teammate Carlos Sainz at the end of  the second day, was originally threatened with a crippling time penalty of  14min 30sec after blocking a special stage start on purpose after his  windscreen was smashed.
When he appealed, a race jury decided to go even further and bar him from  the rest of the race.
The controversy blew up when race scrutineers examined his engine before  the 16th special stage. The bonnet then blew open, smashing his windscreen  just before the start.
McRae, blaming the officials for failing to close the bonnet's securing  pins properly, blocked the road for 29 minutes in protest while the windscreen  was repaired, so that the stage could not begin without him.
He had ended the day just seven seconds off Sainz's lead, the Subaru pair  followed by German Armin Schwarz in his Mitsubishi Lancer, 4:25 behind, before  race officials went into a marathon meeting before deciding on the ban.
McRae said before the decision: "To be penalised, when it was not my  fault, would be a shame. I hope the officials will decide in my favour."
Britain's Malcolm Wilson (Ford Escort) had ended the day in fourth before  the expulsion, another 30 seconds back and world champion Juha Kankkunen of  Finland 6:13 off the pace in his Toyota Celica.
Kankkunen's teammate Dider Auriol of France, the 1992 winner, was the  other big loser of the day, forced to retire with engine trouble while in  second place.
