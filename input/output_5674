The Channel tunnel is expected to lure more than 25  percent of passengers away from airlines flying the Paris to London route, the  head of the Paris airports' authority said Tuesday.
In an interview with the Tribune Desfosses newspaper, Jean Fleury said he  expected airlines to lose 1.1 million of their current 3.6 million passengers  now flying between London and Paris.
"Of the 2.5 million remaining on the Paris to London route, we are  expecting 1.5 million to use Roissy (airport - north of Paris) and a small  million for Orly (airport - south of Paris)," he said.
French authorities Monday announced the opening as of June 13 of Orly to  British Airways flights from London.
The airport authority is planning to regroup all London flights at one of  the two Orly terminals, representing an investment of 150 million francs (25.9  million dollars), Fleury said.
