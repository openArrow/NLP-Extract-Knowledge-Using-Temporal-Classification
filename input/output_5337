Indonesian forestry authorities plan to cut down  20 percent of the nation's forests in the next 25 years for use as farm land  and housing for people who will be moved from crowded areas, an official said  Monday.
"What we will maintain during the PJPT II (the second 25-year development  plan) will no longer be 141 million hectares (320 million acres) but 113  hectares (256 million acres)," Forestry Minister Jamaludin Suryohadikusumo  said after meeting President Suharto.
Indonesia said last year that it had 141 million hectares of forest,  Jamaludin said, but about 250,000 hectares (567,500 acres) were converted into  agricultural land every year for producing rubber, palm oil, coconuts and  other crops.
Another 150,000 hectares (340,500 acres) have been opened every year for  mixed use -- settlement and farm land, he said.
Under the government's transmigration program, millions of people are  being moved from densely populated Java and Bali to the outer islands.
Java and Bali are currently home to more than 110 million of Indonesia's  186 million people.
Jamaludin said that satellite surveys have shown that Indonesian forests  had a total of 2.4 billion cubic metres (3.120 million cubic yards) of wood.  The government harvests 37 million cubic metres (48.100 million cubic yards)  of wood per year.
He added that PT Indah Kiat pulp and paper plant in the Sumatran province  of Riau, which has expanded its production capacity beyond its log supply,  will now also be supplied with trees from palm oil estates and wood waste from  logging in the Riau provinces.
The government fined the firm 1.2 billion rupiah (568,990 dollars) in  September after it was found to be using more raw materials than its  concessions could supply, implying that it was logging illegally.
The authorities were still searching for the source of the illegal supply.
