The director of Madrid's Prado museum, Francisco  Calvo Serraller, announced Saturday he was resigning over a dispute with  Culture Minister Carmen Alborch on the commercial use of a gallery.
Calvo Serraller, 46, made the announcement in a letter published by the  daily El Pais. He had been museum director since October 22 last year.
He clashed with Alborch for allowing the gallery containing Velasquez'  masterpiece "Las Meninas" to be photographed for a fee of 80,000 pesetas (600  dollars).
The photographs were for a furniture magazine on which Calvo Serraller's  wife is an editorial adviser.
Calvo Serraller maintained that the museum rules permit the commercial use  of galleries, but the minister said earlier this week that she did not agree.
