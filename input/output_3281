A bomb exploded Monday in an unoccupied office of  the Belfast City Hall, injuring at least two persons, one of them seriously,  police said.
The injured were workmen restoring the building.
Police said the office in which the bomb exploded was one regularly used  by Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), raising  suspicions it had been planted by Protestant extremists. There was no  immediate claim of responsibility.
The blast came about 30 minutes after a Belfast shopping mall security  guard was shot in the head and by two gunmen in an attack claimed by the IRA.  The guard later died in hospital.
In another attack Monday claimed by the IRA, a soldier was injured by a  bomb blast in Londonderry, in the northwest of Northern Ireland.
