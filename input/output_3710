US warships fired warning shots at two vessels  off the coast of Haiti as part of the enforcement of the international embargo  on the Haitian regime, but one of them still broke the blockade, officials  said Tuesday.
The latest incident involved a Panamanian-flagged ship that was stopped by  the US Coast Guard late Monday and boarded Tuesday, said White House  spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers. Results of the inspection were not immediately  available.
On Saturday, a Bahamian-registered vessel, "Sea Search," ignored warnings  fired fired across its bow from the US Navy sip Aubrey Fitch and slipped past  the blockade into port, said Defense Department spokesman Dennis Boxx.
Myers said the Bahamian vessel was too close to shore to take action.
"It is still in port and we're ascertaining what to do about it there,"  she said.
The embargo is being enforced by eight US warships as well as two frigates  from Argentina and Canada.
Boxx said since last October, 1,005 vessels had been stopped for  inspection and 81 turned back,
Since a near-total embargo was imposed over the weekend, 14 vessels have  beeen stopped and turned back, with 10 allowed to pass.
The embargo is based on UN Security Council resolution 917, which gave the  leadership of the Haitian military 15 days to step down or face an embargo on  everything but food, medicine, books, information materials and commercial  airline flights.
