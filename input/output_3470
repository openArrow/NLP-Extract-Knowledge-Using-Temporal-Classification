Reporters and technical employees at the BBC were  holding a 24-hour strike Tuesday to protest plans that would link salary to  performance.
Radio programs were at a minimum and the BBC television station was runnig  movies Tuesday morning instead of its usual programming.
The strike was called by the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) which is  opposed to plans linking salary to employee performance in order to save the  company 50 million pounds (75 million dollars) this year.
The union says that the proposal means employees would be overworked.
The BBC management, meanwhile, has told employees that they would not be  paid for the strike day and denied that it has threatened to fire those who  walked off the job Tuesday or block their promotions.
The strike was the first at the BBC since 1989.
