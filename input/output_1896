China is to open 13 blocks covering 40,000  kilometres (24,800 miles) in the South China Sea to exploration by foreign oil  companies, Xinhua news agency reported.
The fields are situated in the Pearl River Delta near Hong Kong and in the  Yinggehai and Qiong Dongdan basins to the southeast and south of Hainan island  respectively, the agency quoted the China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC)  as saying.
CNOOC chief geologist Gong Zaisheng said this was the first time China had  invited foreign bids for offshore exploration through acreage promotion,  meaning the authorities will hold seminars and private meetings to supply  information to all interested companies.
But one foreign oilman here said that while he expected there to be more  bilateral negotations this time, the differences from the previous four rounds  of offshore bidding would in fact be small.
The closing date for bids is expected to be in late October, he said.
Gong, who is to head a delegation to Houston, Texas, for a promotion from  June 20 to 24, said 80 foreign firms had been informed of the opening up of  the blocks.
The official said the Yinggehai and Qiong Dongnan basins had originally  been reserved for domestically financed exploration but were now being offered  to foreigners due to lack of funding and inadequate technology.
He said the blocks in this region had good prospects for natural gas in  particular, adding that those in the Pearl River Delta also included a batch  of hopeful exploration targets.
While foreign firms continue to show great interest in bidding for  exploration of China's offshore fields, oilmen acknowledge that finds to date  have been relatively small.
Last year, offshore oil accounted for less than four percent of China's  output of some 140 million tonnes of crude oil.
CNOOC has signed 94 contracts with 55 oil companies from 15 countries in  the past decade, the Xinhua report said.
