The Khmer Rouge Tuesday assailed Vietnam's  continuing influence in Cambodia in a radio commentary seen as setting the  stage for forthcoming peace talks in Pyongyang.
In a broadcast monitored in Bangkok, Khmer Rouge radio made no direct  reference to the negotiations among the various Cambodian factions set to  start in the North Korean capital on May 27.
But it carried a commentary that dwelled at length on one of the guerrilla  faction's principal preoccupations: the presence of Vietnamese settlers in  Cambodia and Hanoi's continuing influence in the country.
Observers said this was a clear indication that the Marxist Khmer Rouge  intended to raise the issue in Pyongyang.
"The Vietnamese and Vietnamese settlers are everywhere on Khmer territory,  but no one ever addresses the problem. (The government) thinks only of seeking  foreign military assistance to attack the Khmer resistance fighters who  struggled against the Vietnamese aggressors," the radio said.
The commentary was referring to the Khmer Rouge's leading role in the  resistance struggle in the decade after Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia at the  end of 1978.
The guerrillas' former allies in that struggle are now joined in a  coalition government in Phnom Penh alongside former members of the government  installed by Hanoi.
The commentary recalled the 1991 Paris peace accords which, it said,  "required all Vietnamese aggressor forces and Vietnamese of all categories to  withdraw from Cambodia and never to return."
