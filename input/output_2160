One of the shorter press conferences of the  Cannes film festival was given Thursday by US megastar Bruce Willis, here to  promote his new blood-and-sex blockbuster, "Color of Night."
Willis was the star of the show at a meet-the-media event in a private  suite of the Martinez hotel, just along from the Festival Palace on the Cannes  seafront.
Champagne and canapes flowed. Journalists were fed press packs. Properly  softened up, the assembled hoards were treated to a selection of clips from  the new movie.
Then came question time, starting with the obligatory questions on  were-the-sex-scenes-real, weren't you embarrassed with your leading lady  afterwards, and so on. Willis loosened up.
Just as things were looking good, the unexpected, but perhaps not so  unreasonable, happened. "Mr. Willis, don't you ever worry about people paying  out good money for such sxxx?," enquired the hackette.
Smile barely tightening, Willis was the consummate star. "Am I mistaken,  or did you stay up all night thinking of that one?" he said. "No, it just came  to me," came the reply, to unmistakeable applause.
Exit Willis, stage left.
