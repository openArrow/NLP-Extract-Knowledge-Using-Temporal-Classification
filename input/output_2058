Three-time Olympic gold medallist Johann Olav Koss of  Norway has retired from international speed skating to concentrate on his  medical studies.
Koss said it was impossible to combine skating with studies and he was  also having difficulty motivating himself after such a successful season.
The 25-year-old broke world records every time he won a gold medal in  Lillehammer in February.
