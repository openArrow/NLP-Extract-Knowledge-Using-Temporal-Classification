Berzin said: "Argentin told me that if he was in trouble I could go for  it. When I saw him struggling, I realised it was up to me.
"I don't know what my ambitions are in this race -- I'll have to wait at  least until the next time trial at Follonica on Sunday. Indurain is still the  tops in that discipline."
Indurain said: "I had a little trouble when Berzin attacked but otherwise  I felt comfortable. I wasn't really worried but I will have to watch Berzin.  He could be the surprise of the Giro."
Chiappucci, meanwhile, said: "I don't understand what happened. I couldn't  keep up and I would like to know why. When I've worked it out, I'll attack --  that's the only way I'll get something out of the race."
