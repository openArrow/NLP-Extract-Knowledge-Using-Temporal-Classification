Armenian and Azeri defence ministers agreed to a  ceasefire in Nagorno-Karabakh Monday, signing a preliminary accord here for  the deployment of peacekeepers in the disputed enclave, the Interfax agency  said.
The warring parties, meeting under Russian mediation together with the  enclave's separatist Armenian authorities, agreed to a total ceasefire to come  into effect at 0000 hours Tuesday (2000 GMT Monday), the agency said.
The parties also signed a preliminary accord for the creation within the  conflict zone, as of May 24, of 49 observer posts to be manned by Russian,  Armenian, Azeri and other Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) troops and  commanded by Russians.
The accord, which the agency said would be formalised Tuesday in a  definitive document, also provided for the subsequent deployment in the  enclave of a 1,800-strong peace force of CIS soldiers.
Accord signatories were Armenian Defence Minister Sergei Sarkissyan, and  his Azeri, Nagorno-Karabakh and Russian counterparts Mamedrafi Mamedov, Samvel  Babayan and Pavel Grachev.
Earlier in the day Russian President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy  Vladimir Kazimirov said Monday's meeting was convened prior to formal talks to  reach a final truce agreement, the withdrawal of troops and the stationing of  the CIS force and international observers.
Russia and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe have been  trying since February to get Armenia and Azerbaijan to accept the package.
