The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on Tuesday  announced that it was preparing two more camps for Rwandans who have fled to  Tanzania, not far from the Benaco site, which is overcrowded with 272,000  people.
Foa said the camps, based at Lumace and Katose, should be ready within a  week. The UNHCR and UN Children's Fund was concerned to ensure that they both  had adequate drinking water supplies, she added.
The UNHCR has enough lorries to transport sick and wounded refugees from  the Rwandan border to Benaco, 45 kilometres (28 miles) inside Tanzania, she  said.
Between 700 and 4,000 Rwandans arrive each day in Tanzania, which is  already host to 320,000 registered refugees, Foa said. She added that it could  be a "good sign" that thousands of them had gone back to Rwanda to fetch sacks  of maize.
