French premier Edouard Balladur  arrived in the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe late Wednesday and hailed  the release of 11 French aid workers held prisoner by Bosnian Serbs.
"I am pleased things turned out as they did and they got released," he  said, learning of the release on his arrival here.
He said his government had from the outset been worried about the fate of  the "French hostages" in Bosnia, and hoped that they would "soon get back to  good health and return to their everyday lives and jobs."
"In such circumstances, it is the government's duty to do everything  possible to ensure the safety of our nationals wherever they may be and in  whatever situation they find themselves.
"We stuck to our task, and I am happy that this evening things were sorted  out."
He refused to say what had changed the minds of the Bosnian Serbs, who had  held the aid workers from the organisation Premiere Urgence in Sarajevo for 41  days on what their colleagues said were trumped-up charges of gun-running for  the Bosnian Moslems.
Balladur and French Overseas Departments and Territories Minister  Dominique Perben are due to go on to Martinique and Guyana.
