A UN spokesman said Sunday he had received  unconfirmed reports that Rwanda's interim government had fled the town of  Gitarama, southwest of Kigali.
UN officials were trying to verify the reports, spokesman Abdul Kabia said.
The self-declared interim government fled Kigali on April 12, and  established their base at Gitarama, 50 kilometres, (35 miles) southwest of the  capital, after Rwanda Patriotic Front rebels launched an offensive on the  capital.
The rebels have been tightening their grip on Kigali over the past couple  of weeks and advancing towards Gitarama.
