Dundee United cup hero Craig Brewster  had the memories of final defeats as a fan to spur him on at Hampden Park.
Brewster, who followed the Tannadice club as a boy, had suffered the  heartbreak of watching them fail from the terraces in previous finals.
But it all came right as his 47th minute goal shot down Rangers' bid for a  second consecutive treble on Saturday, and he said: "I thought we were  absolutely superb in the first half.
"All credit to the lads because they kept fighting away. We hung on well  for the last 20 minutes and when Christian Dailly sent his shot across goal I  was praying it would hit the post so I could score."
Manager Ivan Golac was full of praise for his youngsters and warned: "Look  out, Europe, here we come."
He said: "We're going to be a good team and I am trying to impress upon  them not to respect any other team too much either, in Scotland or in the  European Cup Winners' Cup next season."
Golac revealed: "The boys were even more determined after being denied a  penalty in the first half, and I told them at half-time they were more than  capable of winning."
"I'm pleased for our fans, too, because they have been absolutely terrific  throughout the Cup run."
Disappointed Rangers' boss Walter Smith admitted: "I told the players if  they made no errors after half-time they could go on to win but those words  have a habit of coming back to haunt you and we lost to a terrible goal.
