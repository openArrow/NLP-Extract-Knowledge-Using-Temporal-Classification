Dozens of pilgrims were killed in a  stampede Monday at the Moslem holy site here, witnesses said, as authorities  confirmed the incident but gave no death toll.
The witnesses, who would not be identified, said they did not know how the  tragedy on Monday afternoon occurred.
They said pilgrims had been trampled to death and bodies littered the  site, while religious ceremonies were taking place. Saudi security forces were  at the scene but ambulances were initially barred from access.
The incident occurred as the Saudi authorities were proclaiming the  successful completion of this year's pilgrimage, in which more than two  million Moslems took part.
But a Saudi health ministry statement broadcast by state television said  later, "a total of 829 people died during the pilgrimage season this year, as  a result of this afternoon's stampede and for other reasons such as heart  attacks and old age."
It also said that 6,400 received hospital treatment as a result of sun  stroke and fainting.
Before news of the stampede, King Fahd had sent a message to Pilgrimage  Minister Mahmud Ben Mohamed Safar praising the "success" of the annual event.
The pilgrimage to Mecca, a religious duty at least once on a lifetime for  all Moslems who can afford it, officially began on May 20 this year but  pilgrims began arriving several weeks beforehand.
In July 1990 more than 1,400 people were killed in a panic-stricken  stampede in a tunnel near here. Most were Indonesian or Turkish.
