Venezuela has taken the first steps toward  requesting membership in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the  head of the Foreign Trade Institute said Sunday.
Alberto Poletto said officals had called in the US ambassador to Caracas  to discuss joining the trade pact grouping Canada, Mexico and the United  States.
Poletto said the goal of Latin American economic integration was not only  to gain access to neighboring markets, but to break into new markets worldwide.
"Opening the economy is a vote for greater reciprocity, more labor and  management cooperation and revitalizing the economy," said Poletto, who also  warned any integration process would have to address the countries' social  problems.
NAFTA, which took effect January 1, created a mega-market of some 360  million consumers stretching from the Yukon to the Yucatan peninsula.
