Men whose prostate glands are removed, a  common cancer surgery, have a much greater than expected risk of losing  control of urinary functions and the ability to have sex, a study said.
The incidence of those side effects was much greater in the study,  conducted at Harvard University-affiliated hospitals, than in earlier studies  conducted by surgeons.
In a follow-up of 282 patients a year after their prostates were taken  out, 41 percent still had to wear diapers or pads because they leaked urine  and 88 percent could not get an erection.
Before the surgery, three percent needed pads and 31 percent could not  perform sexual intercourse.
"Patients need to know what they are in for," said James Talcott, the  doctor who presented his findings at a meeting of the American Society of  Clinical Oncology in Dallas Tuesday.
Talcott, of Dana-Farber Cancer Center in Boston, based his study on  detailed questionnaires before and after the surgery.
The surgeons' studies were based on interviews, which Talcott pointed out  could be influenced by patients' desire to please their doctors by downplaying  negative side effects.
Those studies found that about six percent had poor bladder control and 25  percent were impotent.
Prostate cancer can be detected at a very early stage and urologists, who  are surgical specialists, often recommend that the diseased gland be removed.  But because prostate tumors grow slowly, the potential benefit of the surgery  may be years in the future.
An estimated 80,000 to 90,000 prostate removal surgeries will be performed  in the United States this year.
