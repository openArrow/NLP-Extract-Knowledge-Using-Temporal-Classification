A high-ranking Iranian diplomat has been ordered  out of Britain, following reports that Iranian intelligence has been in  contact with the banned Irish Republican Army (IRA), the Guardian said  Saturday.
But London was trying to keep the move secret in the hope Tehran would not  retaliate in the latest in a series of rows between the two countries, the  paper added.
Iran's charge d'affaires, Gholamreza Ansari, was told of the decision on  Thursday when he was summoned to see foreign office Minister of State Douglas  Hogg, according to The Guardian.
Although the foreign office refused to comment on the expulsion, officials  confirmed the meeting had taken place.
The expulsion follows recent British charges that the Iranian intelligence  services had been in contact with the IRA, which is waging a bloody campaign  to divorce Northern Ireland from Britain and unite it with Ireland. Tehran  denied the allegations and claimed Britain had bugged its London embassy.
Relations between Britain and Iran have been strained since the Islamic  revolution in 1979.
Ties between the two countries were severed in 1989 after Iranian  religious leaders issued a "fatwa" calling for the killing of British writer  Salman Rushdie, who they said had blasphemed Islam in his novel "The Satanic  Verses."
