Twenty Tuareg rebels have been killed and six  injured in two separate clashes with government patrols after a two-month lull  in rebel attacks, officials say.
Interior Minister Ousmane Oumarou told AFP Thursday that 15 of them were  killed and five detained after a shootout with troops Monday between Assode  and Timia, in the Iferouane region.
Troops seized a four-wheel drive vehicle, weapons, ammunition and various  documents of the Front for the Liberation of the Air and Azawagh (FLAA), one  of four Tuarag rebel movements in Niger, the minister said.
Late Thursday, state television said five rebels and been killed and one  captured in the Tillaberi region 100 kilometres (60 miles) northwest of here  near the border with Mali.
Government spookesman Moctar Diallo also formally denied reports that  around 20 Niger troops were killed in the clash at Iferouane.
The clashes came after the government and the rebels last week said they  would seek a negotiated end to the conflict which has claimed 126 lives since  it erupted in November 1991 -- 50 of them rebels, 47 civilians and 29 members  of the security forces.
Officials from mediating countries -- Algeria, Burkina Faso and France --  met with delegates from the two sides last week and said the government and  the rebels agreed in principle to a meeting soon.
Both sides last met in Ouagadougou in February, but failed to meet in  Paris at the end of March as initially planned.
The Tuaregs' Coordination of the Armed Resistance (CRA) grouping wants a  high degree of autonomy for the 750,000-strong Tuareg community in the north  and centre of the country.
