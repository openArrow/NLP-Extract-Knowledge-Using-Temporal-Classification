A leader of the Krahns, one of two warring  factions within Liberia's United Liberation Movement (ULIMO), Monday accused  rival Mandingos of wanting to set up an "Islamic state" in the war-ravaged  state.
Acting ULIMO vice president Harry Nayou told reporters in Monrovia he  escaped from Tubmanburg, some 60 kilometres (38 miles) north of the capital,  where he said he had been held "hostage" for almost two months by Mandingos  under the movement's leader Alhaji Kromah.
Nayou explained he had taken five days to reach the city on foot, arriving  there Sunday.
"Innocent people were killed and their hearts and livers eaten before me  by mercenaries Kromah imported from Mali and Guinea," he alleged. He said  Kromah had a force of "several hundred mercenaries" from the two countries  with whose help he planned to "overrun Monrovia and change Liberia into an  Islamic state."
"Kromah was determined to kill me, but God was on my side," Nayou said,  adding he had twice narrowly escaped death.
He said the mother of ULIMO's military commander, General Roosevelt  Johnson, was also a hostage in Tubmanburg. "She is alive but under  intermittent death threats," he asserted.
Kromah later denied in a press statement that he had any intention of  setting up an Islamic state. He implied Nayou had been allowed to leave.
"I am really suprised that Nayou uttered these lies after all the good  treatment my boys gave him in Tubmanburg," Kromah said. "If my boys wanted to  kill him, they could have done so a long time ago." He described his rival as  a "tribalist and trouble-maker."
