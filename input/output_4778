A 17-year-old boy pleaded not guilty here  Friday to murdering his parents and two sisters after having what he called "a  bad day."
Immediately after the Thursday shooting, police said Clay Shrout went to  school where he threatened his classmates with the gun he used to kill his  family.
He surrendered to the school's deputy head after a 10-minute talk, police  said.
"The student handed him the gun and said 'I've had a bad day,'" said  headmaster Randy Cooper.
A neighbour and classmate of Shrout said the boy had recently been ditched  by his girlfriend, had boasted of taking drugs and complained about problems  with his parents.
A special suicide watch has been put on Shrout who was remanded in custody.
