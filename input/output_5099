Some 400,000 Rwandans are fleeing south from the  Rwandan capital Kigali, following the advance of the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan  Patriotic Front, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said here  Sunday.
"They have nothing to eat and nothing to drink. It is a very grave  situation," said ICRC spokesman Tony Burgener.
The exodus into a region already overburdened by previous waves of  refugees from the fighting is causing huge problems for the ICRC's aid  operations.
The ICRC said that following the latest wave of evacuations, Kigali was  now practically empty of civilians.
The RPF says it controls more than half the country and seemed Saturday on  the point of taking Kigali. RPF forces have also moved on Gitarama where the  Hutu-dominated interim government is based.
Denounced by the rebels as a "gang of killers," the interim government put  in place after the April 6 death of president Juvenal Habyarimana has been  widely accused of being responsible for most of the 200,000-500,000 deaths in  fighting since then.
"We cannot help 400,000 people in transit. To set-up a camp is very  difficult in the area because of its mountainous topography," Burgener said.
"The situation is also difficult because of the security conditions," he  said.
The ICRC needs 5,000 tonnes of food a month to feed 400,000 people, or 166  tonnes a day. "But a plane, when one can get in, transports only 12 to 13  tonnes each trip," he said.
Food stocks are being built up in the neighbouring countries of Burundi  and Tanzania but there the problems are already serious with 300,000 people  living as refugees in Tanzania alone.
