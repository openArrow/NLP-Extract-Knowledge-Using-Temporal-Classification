Krajisnik, the Bosnian Serb speaker, arrived in Geneva later Tuesday,  according to sources close to the contact group.
The Geneva sources said Silajdzic and Zubak had already arrived in the  Swiss city.
Diplomatic sources in Geneva said preliminary talks would be held later  Tuesday in Talloires in preparation for the meeting Wednesday.
Before leaving Belgrade, Krajisnik was quoted by the Belgrade news agency  BETA as saying that the resumption of negotiations on Bosnia were "hitting up  against some big problems."
He did not specify what these were, however.
Krajisnik was accompanied by his his self-proclaimed Serb republic's  "foreign minister" Aleksandar Buha.
The BETA agency, quoting an official communique, had said Krajisnik would  outline the Bosnian Serb position to international mediators David Owen for  the European Union and Thorvald Stoltenberg for the United Nations.
It said the Serb side would ask for a "final" stop to fighting throughout  Bosnia-Hercegovina and demand to be "treated the same" as other parties.
This was taken to mean that the Bosnian Serb negotiators would link their  participation in negotiations to lifting international sanctions decreed  against the rump Yugoslavia in May 1992.
