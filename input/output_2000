A seventh youth has been charged in  connection with an attack by skinheads on a group of Africans in this eastern  German town, the state prosecutor said Wednesday.
Investigators also have the names of 30 other suspects in the attack by 50  or 60 drunken skinheads who chased five Africans through the streets on May  12, which was a public holiday.
Six of the seven so far charged have been arrested, and one is on the run.  A warrant for an eighth was rejected by the Magdeburg court.
The case sparked accusations of laxity by the police and prosecuting  authorities for allowing the chase to take place and then initially releasing  some 50 suspects they had arrested.
A silent protest march through Magdeburg has been called for later  Thursday by church and anti-racist associations.
The Africans, who say that the police stood by looking on as the skinheads  chased them, took shelter in a cafe frequented by Turks, who confronted the  attackers with knives, according to witnesses.
Of the several people hurt, all were Germans. One 24-year-old is still in  a coma in "very serious" condition, the prosecutor in the case, Rudolf  Jaspers, said.
Jaspers said the investigation was now taking on a "new aspect" and that  he was seeking to find out to what extent foreigners were involved in the  bloody Ascension Day violence.
Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger admitted in parliament  Wednesday that the police had made "mistakes," and said they could have  contained the violence had they intervened more rapidly.
But she believed existing legislation was sufficient to cope with such  events and called for those laws to be applied strictly.
Konrad Weiss of the opposition Alliance 90-Greens coalition said that  passers-by who tried to intervene to stop the neo-fascists appeared to have  been hampered by police.
Juergen Schmude of the main opposition Social Democrat Party said attacks  on foreigners must stop.
