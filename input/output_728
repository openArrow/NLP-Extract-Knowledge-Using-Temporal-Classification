Steffi Graf retained her German Open title -- her  eighth in nine years -- with a 7-6 (8/6) 6-4 victory over Brenda Schultz here  on Sunday.
It was Graf's 20th consecutive final since March 1993, and her 16th  victory -- and ample warning to her rivals a week before the French Open.
For Schultz it was the biggest final of her career, and her serve, the  fastest in women's tennis, forced several errors from Graf.
But the world number one seed was quicker around court and made less  unforced errors.
She failed to break, however, during the first set, with Schultz having  the best chance at 3-3 when she took Graf to deuce.
A backhand in the net and a wide return let Graf off the hook that time  before Schultz survived a similar scare at 6-5 with an ace to take early  control in the following tiebreak.
The Dutch girl's 3-0 lead was pegged back to 4-4 before Schultz missed a  set point at 6-5 by netting a backhand.
That gave Graf the chance to produce a perfect backhand return down the  line to take the set and she broke for a 2-1 lead in the second, a lead she  never lost.
Graf received a cheque for 150,000 dollars, and 11th seeded Schultz  receiving 60,000 dollars.
