Rwandan rebel and army commanders opened  UN-mediated truce talks in Kigali on Monday, amid heavy fighting which  prevented UN troops from evacuating civilians, UN officials said.
Gunfire erupted outside the UN headquarters at the Amahoro hotel minutes  before army brigadier general Marcel Gatsuinzi arrived in a white UN armoured  personnel carrier.
"It's a very tense situation here," said UN military spokesman Major  Jean-Guy Plante. "There's been heavy shelling and a lot of fighting."
