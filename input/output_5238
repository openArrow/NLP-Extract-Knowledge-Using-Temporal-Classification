Mario Andretti's farewell  Indianapolis 500 continued the hard-luck efforts that have plagued him since  his only win here in 1969.
Andretti lasted only 23 laps before fuel system problems forced him out.  It was the eighth time in 29 Indy races he placed in the bottom four. He  finished last in 1968.
But the memory Andretti carries from his final race will be of a standing  ovation and cheers given by a crowd estimated at 500,000.
"It's so extremely rewarding to hear that and feel it," Andretti said.  "The emotion I felt from the crowd has made all these years worthwhile in  every way. It has almost made the struggles here over the years so much easier  to take."
