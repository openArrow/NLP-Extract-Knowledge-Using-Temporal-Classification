Southern warplanes were bombing newly-won northern positions, defying  anti-aircraft fire.
Jifri implicitly recognised that the base, garrisoned by 20,000 men, had  fallen, saying that its weaponry had been removed.
"The northerners knew all the military and artillery positions inside the  base, so it was only natural that we took out the heavy artillery to hide it  elsewhere," he said.
The base appeared deserted Monday evening, but heavy fighting was going on  in the surrounding hills.
The AFP photographer at the base said the gun turrets on the northerners'  tanks were turned towards the south.
Asked if they had come from Aden or Sanaa, the soldiers replied joyously:  "Sanaa."
Some five kilometres separated the northern troops and the southern army,  which was bringing up heavy artillery and pounding northerners' positions.
Truckloads of civilians were fleeing in panic either towards Aden or to  the mountains in the north.
The northern army has been concentrating its efforts on the strategic  route for the past few days.
Heavy fighting was also reported on the eastern front some 40 kilometres  (24 miles) from Aden, and journalists trying to get there were sent back by  southern troops.
Warplanes were continuously landing and taking off from Aden throughout  Monday evening, but the local population remained calm.
The two sides lurched into civil war on May 5 after months of arguing over  how to run the country, formed from the unification in May 1990 of  conservative North Yemen and poorer, Marxist South Yemen.
