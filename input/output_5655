North Korean troops on Monday removed their  equipment from the Military Armistice Commission (MAC) hall in the border  truce village of Panmunjom, South Korean Defence Ministry officials said  Tuesday.
The border guards stripped microphones and speakers from their side of the  hall, which has been used to supervise the truce between the two Koreas since  the MAC was signed after the devastating 1950-53 Korean War, they said.
North Korea unilaterally pulled its MAC representatives out of Panmunjom  in late April saying the MAC should be replaced by a peace treaty.
Then on May 2 US officials said North Korea had informed the US-led allied  command of its intention to pull out of the MAC altogether.
"We believe the North Koreans pulled out the equipment as a sign of  opposition to the MAC, and to it being led by a South Korean general," a  defence ministry official told AFP.
The official said South Korea's equipment remained in place as a signal  that they were prepared to continue meetings, and he indicated that the North  Koreans were still talking with US officers at Panmunjom.
US 8th army officials, who on May 2 said a dialogue was underway among all  concerned parties to resolve the issue, were not immediately available for  comment on the move.
In the absence of a peace treaty, the United States and North Korea are  still technically at war.
In March of 1991 Major General Hwang Won-Tak became the first South Korean  to head the Southern side of the commission, which had been headed by an  American general since the war.
Since his appointment North Korea has virtually boycotted full MAC  meetings, contending they would only talk with the US side because North Korea  signed the armistice agreement with the American Army.
Low-level meetings, however, have been held.
