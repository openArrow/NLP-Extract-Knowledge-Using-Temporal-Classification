Settlers defied a Palestinian police  ban Friday taking guns into the synagogue in the self-rule enclave of Jericho,  an AFP correspondent reported.
Four settlers armed with automatic rifles or machine guns prayed in the  ancient synagogue which is under the protection of the new Palestinian police.
According to one policeman, 18 armed settlers arrived at the end of the  morning and four stayed.
Jericho police spokesman Mohammed Shaker said their presence "was a  flagrant violation of the Cairo accord between Israel and the PLO."
"We are going to try to end this through negotiation," Shaker told AFP.
Palestinian police chief General Nasr Yussef warned Thursday that Israeli  settlers could no longer carry weapons into the Jericho synagogue.
"We will no longer allow settlers to enter the synagogue with guns because  Palestinians are responsible for security in the sector," Yussef said.
Meanwhile Shaker also criticised Israeli military jeeps protecting convoys  of cars crossing the main route through Jericho for not being accompanied by  jeeps driven by Palestinian police.
"It would seem there are soldiers and settlers who want to sabotage the  autonomy accords," he said.
About 20 settlers again took guns into the synagogue during prayers on  Thursday, under the watchful eyes of six Palestinian policemen.
