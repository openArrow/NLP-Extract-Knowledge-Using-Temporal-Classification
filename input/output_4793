Iraq on Friday condemned the expulsion of its top  diplomat in Washington, describing it as "unjustified" and based on "political  and psychological" motives.
An Iraqi foreign ministry spokesman quoted by the official agency INA,  monitored in Cyprus, said Iraq had been "extremely surprised" by the move.
Contrary to US explainations for expelling Adnan Malik, the diplomat had  not "taken part in any activity against the most elementary principles of  diplomatic work," he added.
The United States said Thursday it had expelled Malik for taking part in  political activities incompatible with the restrictions placed on Iraqi  diplomatic activities in the United States.
State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said the diplomat, based in  Washington, had engaged in political activity and other actions violating a  1991 agreement with Baghdad.
But the Iraqi spokesman said there "is no real justification" for the  expulsion and it was "due to political and pyschological motives which had  nothing to do with the Iraqi interest section in the United States."
McCurry said the activities included sending out news releases on the  Iraqi parliament's invitation to Kuwaiti parliamentarians to come to Bagdad  for talks on the World Trade Center bombing and making unauthorized contacts.
The Iraqi spokesman added Malik had returned to Baghdad and Iraq was going  to reinforce its section in Washington "in line with the (diplomatic) accord"  between the two countries, suggesting the diplomat would soon be replaced.
The interest section based in the Algerian embassy handles the limited  diplomatic contacts since Washington and Baghdad broke off relations in 1991.  The United States has an interest section in the Polish embassy of Baghdad.
Malik was sent to Washington in 1991 to set up the section after  previously working at the United Nations in New York.
The Washington Post said his family had been allowed to stay until the end  of the school year.
