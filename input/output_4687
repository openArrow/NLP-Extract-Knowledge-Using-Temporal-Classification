President Boris Yeltsin said Friday that security  on Russia's borders needed to be enforced through diplomatic and political  means in an address to border guard troops, ITAR-TASS reported.
"We must not resort to force in defending our frontiers," Yeltsin said in  a speech on the new conception of Russian border defence.
"Diplomatic and political means must be the basis of our policy on state  border defence," he said.
"This entails peaceful, non-violent settlement of border disputes and only  in extreme cases should we resort to military force and means," he added.
Yeltsin called for stepping up security controls on Russia's southern  border with the Caucasus and Central Asia, two regions of potential  instability.
He also said that there should be closer cooperation with China in  enforcing the border with Mongolia.
The address given at the headquarters of Russian border guard forces came  one day after Yeltsin gave a speech to members of the counterintelligence  agency in which he outlined new priorities for the reformed KGB.
