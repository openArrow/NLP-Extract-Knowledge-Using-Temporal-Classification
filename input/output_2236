Brazil's mint is operating day and  night in an effort to complete printing of the one billion bank notes of the  new currency, the real, in time for its July 1 launch date.
The new currency is one facet of an economic stabilization program devised  by former finance minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who is running for  president in a bid to succeed Itamar Franco.
The real, Brazil's ninth currency in the last 50 years, will be worth  1,000 times the existing cruzeiro real, and is the government's response to  prolonged hyperinflation -- more than 2,500 percent in 1993.
The rampant inflation has dramtically increased the number of bank notes  needed, said Raul Pereira, technical director of the Brazilian mint, located  some 90 kilometers (50 miles) west of Rio de Janeiro.
The printing presses are producing some 24 million bills daily, and some  480 million have been made.
"It's a sad record due to inflation," said Pereira. "In 1970 we made only  300,000 notes per day."
