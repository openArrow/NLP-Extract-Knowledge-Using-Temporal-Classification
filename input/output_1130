"Medea" and its star Diana Rigg picked up  nominations for the best-of-Broadway Tony Awards on Monday.
"Medea," a Euripides tragedy brought to New York by London's Almeida  Theatre, was nominated for best revival of a play along with "Abe Lincoln in  Illinois," "An Inspector Calls" and "Timothy of Athens."
Rigg, who stars as the play's avenging mother, was nominated for best  stage actress.
Also nominated were Nancy Marchand in "Black Comedy," Anna Deavere Smith  in "Twighlight: Los Angeles, 1992," and Joan Rivers in "Sally Marr ... and her  escorts."
"Passion," a harsh Stephen Sondheim musical about unrequited love was set  to score big when the winners are announced June 12, picking up 10 nominations.
Just behind, with nine nominations, were "Beauty and the Beast" musical  and "She Loves me," a revival about romance.
"Passion," "Beauty and the Beast," "A Grand Night for Singing" and the  Dutch production of "Cyrano" received best musical nominations.
"Angels in America: Perestroika," the second half of Tony Kushner's AIDS  epic received a best-play nomination. The work's first half, "Millenium  Approaches," won best-play last year.
Arthur Miller's "Broken Glass" was among several other plays also  competing for the top play prize.
Stephen Spinella, who won the featured-actor Tony for his role in  "Millennium Approaches," was nominated this year in the top acting category as  best actor for "Perestroika."
His chief competitors will be Brian Bedford in "Timon of Athens,"  Christopher Plummer in "No Man's Land," and Sam Waterson playing the title  role in "Abe Lincoln in Illinois."
George Wolfe who won the Tony for best director of a play last year for  "Millennium Approaches" was named again for his direction of "Perestroika"  this year.
His closest rivals are likely to be Stephen Daldry for "An Inspector  Calls," Gerald Gutierrez for "Abe Lincoln in Illinois" and Michael Langham for  "Timon of Athens."
