Spain in coming months may consider reducing the  number of troops it has in Bosnia-Hercegovina, Defense Minister Julian Garcia  Vargas said Thursday, adding that he understood similar plans announced  earlier this week by France.
"It is probable that in coming months, we may consider reducing our troops  in Bosnia," Garcia said at Madrid airport on his return from an official trip  to Turkey. "The UN peacekeepers cannot stay on a mission forever."
Spain has 1,487 troops stationed in ex-Yugoslavia.
Garcia added that he understood the announcement made earlier this week by  France, which said it planned to withdraw 2,500 of its troops from Bosnia by  the end of the year if no moves were made quickly to resolve the war.
"France has made a supreme effort (in Bosnia) compared to other countries  and it seems logical to me that it has no intention of leaving its troops in  Bosnia forever," Garcia said.
