A newly-formed African Jewish organisation called  on the Organisation of African Unity and its member states Monday to normalise  relations with Israel.
The call was made in a statement after the inaugural meeting of the  African Jewish Congress in Harare, attended by 150 representatives from Jewish  communities in Kenya, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Mozambique, Botswana, Namibia and  South Africa.
The congress aimed to become "the umbrella voice of all Jewish communities  in sub-Saharan Africa and to coordinate cultural, religious and social  activities between these small and dispersed communities."
South Africa has the biggest community of Jews in the region with fewer  than 100,000, while Zimbabwe has under a thousand and the other countries have  tiny Jewish populations.
Zimbabwe and some other African states have normalised relations with  Israel since its pact with the Palestine Liberation Organisation, but others  have not changed hostile policies put in place in the wake of the 1973 Middle  East war.
The congress said it welcomed the developments in the Middle East peace  process as an important contribution towards ensuring the "stability, security  and coordinated development of the region as well as the welfare of its  people."
