Will Carling's England rugby  union side won their first match on South African soil here Wednesday, beating  Western Transvaal 26-24 in their third tour match.
England flyhalf Stuart Barnes contributed 16 points with four penalties  and two conversions, while left wing Tony Underwood scored both their tries.
Western Transvaal replied with a goal, a try and four penalties, with left  wing Dewald Basson notching up 19 points with a try, four penalties and a  conversion.
The win would have provided a desperately-needed fillip for England ahead  of their major encounter with Transvaal at Ellis Park in Johannesburg on  Saturday.
England overwhelming control at the lineouts, winning 100 percent of their  throw-ins, the loose and the scrums but, as has been the case in the previous  games, were baffled by the referee's decisions.
"It was a hard game," Carling said. "Unfortunately we were not allowed to  play any rugby. At the moment we don't quite understand what we are being  penalised for."
After England had led 19-6 at halftime, Western Transvaal dominated the  second half as the heat and the hard ground took its toll.
"We just couldn't get going," Carling said. "We are winning the lineouts  but keep getting pulled down so it's very hard to play a game."
Asked about Saturday's match against Transvaal, Carling said: "Yes, it's a  very big one but first we've got to understand what's going on."
