Predominantly-Moslem Malaysia slammed Britain  on Friday for calling on the Bosnian Moslems to admit military defeat, saying  it was tantamount to giving its blessings to Serb atrocities.
"Malaysia cannot accept the British stand," Foreign Minister Abdullah  Ahmad Badawi was quoted by the Bernama news agency as saying.
Abdullah said Malaysia regretted the call made by British Foreign Office  Minister of State Douglas Hogg in London on Wednesday night "as it would  satisfy the Serbs' goal in Bosnia-Hercegovina."
"It is like blessing the Serbs' ethnic cleansing campaign," Abdullah was  quoted saying.
A British Foreign Office spokesman said Hogg told a private group in  London that the Bosnian Moslems "have to recognise military defeat and give up  the notion of recovering lost territory by force."
"Time is running out," Hogg was quoted saying after Britain raised the  possibility of a UN pullout from Bosnia unless the warring factions there  could settle their differences in eight weeks.
Britain has about 3,000 troops under the UN Protection Force in the former  Yugoslavia, double that of Malaysia's contribution to the peacekeeping force.
Abdullah called on the UN Security Council to approve immediately the  request by the Organisation of Islamic Conference to send peacekeeping troops  from its member countries to Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Major powers have announced plans for a make-or-break meeting on Bosnia on  June 13 as France, which has a 6,000-strong force there, gave a blunt warning  Thursday that it would start pulling out its peacekeepers unless there was  decisive progress towards peace.
