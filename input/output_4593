NATO wants to give a quick answer to the  proposals put forward by Russia before it will sign the Partnership for Peace  (PFP) programme, NATO deputy secretary general Sergio Balanzino said Friday.
"It's work in progress, it's a dialogue (with Russia) which becomes  serious and intense and on NATO's side, we'll make our position known  hopefully pretty soon," Balanzino said.
Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said Thursday Moscow wants the  North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to respond to its proposals, notably on  creating a mechanism for consultation on security issues worldwide, and on  increased military and political cooperation.
Balanzino said: "We've taken good note of the Russians' intention to sign  PFP as it is without any change or modification."
However, he was cautious on whether or not the signing would take place  during a NATO foreign affairs ministers' meeting in Istanbul on June 8.
"These are things that need time and reflection. We will certainly be  active and not wait too long before coming to a conclusion and define our  position," Balanzino said.
"But I don't know if we will be able to reach a signature (in Istanbul).
"To dialogue with Russia is not a walk in the park. We've to be serious  and take time," he said.
