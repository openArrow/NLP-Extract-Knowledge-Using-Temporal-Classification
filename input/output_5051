About 100 Cubans eluded guards Saturday and slipped  into the Belgian ambassador's residence to seek asylum, Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina said.
"That is not the route that should be taken by those who would like to  leave the country, so it is up to Belgian authorities familiar with our  positions on the matter to take the appropriate steps," Robaina said as he  prepared to leave for Cairo for a meeting of non-aligned countries.
Cuba routinely denies the right to exit the country to Cuban nationals who  try to leave by seeking asylum in diplomatic facilities.
Witnesses said the group of people, young and old alike, gathered in a  square alongside the residence in Havana's posh Miramar district, and then  slipped into the compound when guards were not looking.
Early witness reports said a few dozen people had entered the residence.  But the group hung a banner outside the house saying 124 asylum-seekers were  inside.
The figure however was not confirmed, and some of the would-be refugees  told reporters outside the building their group comprised 114 people.
"Cuba's position continues to be the same as on previous occasions,"  Robaina said. "They must leave that place; the way to leave the country is ...  not by using pressure and force."
Cuban authorities were patrolling the area outside the residence Saturday  afternoon. The Belgian ambassador, Paul Vermeirsch, could not immediately be  reached for comment.
It was not the first time asylum-seekers cast an eye on the Belgian  diplomatic residence.
On January 26, eight Cubans entered the residence and requested political  asylum in Belgium. In late February they finally accepted a deal in which they  agreed to leave the building after Belgium secured formal assurances from  Cuban authorities that the eight would face no charges.
