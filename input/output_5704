The British printing group De La Rue, which  specialises in bank notes, on Tuesday announced a 24 percent increase in  annual pre-tax profits at 129.8 million pounds (194.7 million dollars)  compared with 104.7 million pounds the previous year.
The results, for the year to March, were in line with analysts'  expectations.
Sales were six percent higher at 592.7 million pounds compared with 559.5  million pounds to March 1993.
Earnings per share were up at 47.5 pence compared with 37.8 pence, while  the dividend was up at 20 pence from 17 pence.
Chairman Lord Limerick said the company had made a "sound start to the new  financial year with strong order books and encouraging trading." He said he  was "confident" for the year ahead.
Limerick said the year to March for De La Rue, which also prints lottery  tickets and credit cards, was one of "strong growth in all business segments."
He said the company's "strategy for profitable growth both from our  existing businesses and through related acquisitions remains appropriate and  the one which we will continue to pursue."
Last week, De La Rue was one of four companies chosen to run Britain's new  national lottery as part of a consortium.
The company also announced last week that takeover talks with banknote  paper producer Portals Group had been called off, adding that it was not  considering a hostile takeover bid.
Shares rose 13 pence to 856 shortly after Tuesday's results, as analysts  said the figures "looked good all round."
