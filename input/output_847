Australia will make a rush trip to Japan to replace  Argentina in next week's Kirin Cup football tournament, the Australian Soccer  Federation (ASF) announced on Monday.
ASF chief executive Ian Holmes said an approach had been received from the  Japan Football Association, offering to pay all the team's expenses.
Australia's late invitation materialised after the Japanese government  refused to allow Argentine star Diego Maradona to enter the country because of  drugs convictions.
Argentina, a World Cup finalist in the United States next month, pulled  out of the tournament in protest.
"We indicated to the Japan Football Association today that we didn't want  to see them in trouble and were prepared to fill the vacancy," said Holmes.
"Coach Eddie Thomson is putting together players who are available and  will be quickly looking for others prepared to participate.
"We have to work quickly to get entry visas and also to give the squad  some days together because the opening match is against Japan on Sunday  followed by France on May 26."
Thomson will have the benefit of reasonably fit players from national  league champions Adelaide City who beat England's Sheffield United 3-0 in  Adelaide on Sunday.
"We want to work very closely with Japan because we see them as the  emerging force in Asian football," said Holmes.
The ASF has been trying to establish close ties with the Asian football  region because of the possibility that world body FIFA would integrate  Australia into the area for future World Cup qualifying rounds.
