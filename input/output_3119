Israel threatened Monday to break off  negotiations unless PLO leader Yasser Arafat retracts comments about the  autonomy agreement.
Environment Minister Yossi Sarid said "Israel will not continue the  autonomy negotiations unless Arafat retracts his comments."
Israel radio on Sunday broadcast extracts from a speech made by Arafat in  South Africa in which he said the autonomy agreement was purely a tactical  move and could be broken.
