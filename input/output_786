The main hotel in the northern  Bosnian town of Tuzla was hit late Sunday by a large-caliber artillery shell  fired from Serb positions, but there were no casualties.
The shell hit the Hotel Tuzla at 10:15 p.m. (2015 GMT), heavily damaging a  room on the building's fourth floor and part of the third floor. Two other  shells landed near the hotel.
An expert from the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), inspecting the damage,  told AFP the 122mm howitzer shell had been fired from Serb positions in the  south-east.
The area around Tuzla, a mainly Moslem enclave in northeastern Bosnia, has  been the scene of heavy fighting in recent days.
The hotel, which is housing foreign journalists covering the fighting,  lies right next to the headquarters of the Moslem-dominated Bosnian government  army's Second Corps in charge of operations in the sector.
The hotel was also occupied by visiting men's and women's basketball  teams, in town to dispute the Bosnia Cup despite the fighting.
The army headquarters had been the scene Sunday afternoon of a special  ceremony in which the corp's commander-in-chief, Hazim Cadic, distributed  diplomas to local "patriotic personalities" to commemorate the May 15 start of  hostilities in Tuzla two years ago.
Firing began right after local television broadcast the ceremony, and one  shell landed near the television offices.
Bosnian Serbs and Moslems have been accusing each other of preparing  large-scale offensives with massive reinforcements in this strategic area.
On Wednesday, shelling killed two people and seriously wounded four in the  old sector of the town, not far from the hotel.
The UN Protection Force spokesman for the northeast sector of the Bosnian  conflict, Captain Jens Kirk, told AFP here earlier Sunday that 196 shells hit  the nearby Vares sector, controlled by the Moslem-dominated Bosnian government  army, on Saturday and a further eight shells were fired on the town early  Sunday.
Vares lies aboud 45 kilometres (27 miles) south of Tuzla and straddles a  maze of routes linking northeast Bosnia to Sarajevo and the Dalmatian coast.
A further 100 shells rained down Saturday on the "Sapna finger" east of  Tuzla, and a UN armoured patrol of Nordic troops came under automatic arms  fire on both Saturday and Sunday, Kirk said.
Bosnian government forces managed over the weekend to take control of Serb  positions at Vijenac hill, near Lukavac, southwest of Tuzla.
Bosnian Colonel Ekrem Advic, head of the press service of the Bosnian  army's Second Corps, told AFP "some of the shells hitting our villages and  Tuzla had been fired" from those positions.
The capture by the Bosnian army of "some 10 square kilometres" (four  square miles) of land in the sector was confirmed by sources close to  UNPROFOR, who linked the Bosnian offensive and the shelling of Tuzla Wednesday.
