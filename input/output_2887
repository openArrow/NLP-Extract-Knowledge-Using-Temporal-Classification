The new trans-Vietnamese high-tension powerline has  been switched on for the first time ahead of its official opening next month,  officials said Sunday.
The 500,000 volt line, Vietnam's largest development project which will  supply desperately needed energy to the country's southern provinces, was  activated for trials Friday at the Hoa Binh power plant south of Hanoi.
The Hoa Binh complex has an annual electric generating capacity of 1.920  megawatts.
If the test is successful, the trials will be extended to the first two  sections of the line between Hanoi and Ha Tinh province and between Ha Tinh  and Quang Nam-Da Nang province in the centre of the country.
Vietnam's Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet personally championed the project,  which began in 1992 and which is expected to cost at least 500 million dollars  -- twice the original estimate.
The construction of the line has been plagued by acts of vandalism and the  theft of building materials.
