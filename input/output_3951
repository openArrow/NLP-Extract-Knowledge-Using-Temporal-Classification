A jolted lover was sentenced here Wednesday to  10 years imprisonment and psychiatric observation for injecting his former  girlfriend with AIDS-infected blood.
Iwan Elias, a 39-year-old Dutch national born in Surinam, was found guilty  of willfully stabbing his former lover, a mother of two, with a seringue  containing blood he had obtained shortly before from a simple-minded friend  suffering from the deadly Acquired Immune-deficiency Syndrome.
"You will get AIDS and will never again have sex," he reportedly told the  woman after stabbing her.
The woman has been diagnosed as HIV-positive.
