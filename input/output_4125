Exports from Vietnam's potential economic powerhouse  in Ho Chi Minh City have fallen short of the government's economic target,  while imports by the southern city are soaring along with the country's trade  deficit, a report said Thursday.
The city exported only 155 million dollars worth of goods in the first  four months, 26.8 percent of the target set for the whole year, according to  figures from the city's Directorate of Commerce quoted in the Tuoi Tre daily.
Ho Chi Minh City accounts for around a fifth of Vietnam's gross domestic  product, but only a sixth of the country's total exports, the newspaper said,  blaming "inadequate overseas promotional drives" by the city's businesses.
The former Saigon's reliance on the exports of agricultural products from  neighbouring provinces was slowing export growth as rice sales overseas slump  due to problems with transport, processing and credit systems.
Le Minh Chau, head of the commerce directorate, blamed the poor  performance on problems with rice exports and sales of coffee, which have  fallen due to local price fluctuations and the refusal of some provinces to  allow exports until prices rise.
Imports in the first four months totalled 229.5 million dollars, leaving  the city with a deficit of 74.5 million dollars. Large amounts of smuggled  goods come into the city by sea or from Cambodia, raising the real trade  deficit substantially.
