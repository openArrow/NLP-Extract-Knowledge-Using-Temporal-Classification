China's top official for Hong Kong affairs  signalled Tuesday that drawn-out Sino-British talks on financing the  territory's new airport would soon bear fruit.
Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, told a Hong  Kong delegation in Beijing that many issues remained to be discussed regarding  the Chek Lap Kok airport, local radio and television reported.
But he added he hoped that Governor Chris Patten -- criticized by Beijing  for his democratic reforms -- would be able to fly out of Chek Lap Kok when  Hong Kong reverts to China in July 1997.
That remark strongly suggested that Beijing is closer than ever to  agreeing on terms for financing the 20.3 billion US dollar airport and related  infrastructure, after years of bickering over how much debt should be incurred.
Talks on how much debt should be issued to pay for Chek Lap Kok ended  without agreement Friday, but with both sides insisting that progress was  being made.
In Hong Kong, a government spokesman said: "We welcome this indication  that our discussions with the Chinese side on financing for the airport ...  will be brought to an early and successful conclusion."
Patten is in London this week for consultations with Prime Minister John  Major and other British officials.
Though site preparation at Chek Lap Kok is well underway, government  sources have said the ability to meet the mid-1997 deadline for opening the  airport is endangered by the lack of a financing agreement.
The British side favors raising debt on international capital markets,  taking advantage of keen interest among major banking groups as well as the  lowest US dollar interest rates in years.
But China is fearful of the amount of debt that would have to be paid back  after 1997, and is insisting that as much of the project be paid for out of  Hong Kong's bulging reserves as possible.
