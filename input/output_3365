A missile hit the Yemeni capital Monday, killing at  least four people and injuring 27, correspondents on the spot reported.
The attack on Sanaa was the first missile strike against the northern  bastion of President Ali Abdallah Saleh since the south proclaimed itself  independent early on Saturday.
A German television photographer counted four dead including three  children and 27 injured in the first hour after the attack. The missile which  struck at 8:30 p.m. destroyed at least six houses.
The photographer said the missile fell about 200 meters (yards) from the  presidential palace and behind the city's Jumhuriya Hospital where many  windows were blown out.
Casualties were rushed to the Jumhuriya hospital which was undamaged apart  from shattered windows and rescue workers were combing through the rubble in  search of more injured.
A military spokesman said a missile fired by secessionist southern forces  had hit the city but could not confirm that it was a Scud missile.
Another reporter at the scene said the missile flattened several houses  and others were badly damaged.
