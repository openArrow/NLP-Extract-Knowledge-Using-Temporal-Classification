The dollar remained stable against most European  currencies early on Friday except against the French franc which rose on  Thursday's cut in French interest rates which was seen as being good for the  French economy.

"But the trade negotiations between the US and Japan appear to be  progressing well. We are receiving optimistic noises from Washington," she  added.
The French franc continued to rise on the Bank of France's decision to cut  its two key interest rates on Thursday, slicing the tender rate by 0.1 point  to 5.4 percent and its five to 10-day repurchase rate by 35 points to 5.40  percent.
The French currency was being traded at 5.6563 francs to the dollar  compared with 5.6663 at the close on Thursday and at 3.4182 francs to the mark  from 3.4204.
"The market believes the French recovery will be stronger than expected,"  Bell said.
The lira was firmer at 957 lire to the mark from 957.1 at the previous  close, and 958.1 on Wednesday, as the market welcomed the Italian senate's  vote of confidence in Silvio Berlusconi on Wednesday night.
But the Greek currency tumbled to 149.91 drachma to the mark from 148.98  at the Thursday close.
"The drachma is under strong pressure this morning, and we believe it will  fall further," Bell said, indicating the Bank of Scotland saw the drachma  dropping to 160 drachma to the mark by the end of the year and to 170 in 1995.
In Athensthe chief dealer at Citibank in Greece, Yorgo Kondoyannis said:  "The pressure is very strong and the Bank of Greece now holds the key to the  situation."
Reports on Greek radio said that managers of the central bank were meeting  repeatedly and that Friday was a "crucial day" for the drachma.
