A missile fired by north Yemeni forces early  Wednesday slammed into Aden, the principal city in southern Yemen, triggering  a huge fire near the airport, correspondents reported.
South Yemeni anti-aircraft units had earlier opened fire in an attempt to  intercept the missile.
Ambulances and fire engines rushed to the scene but there were no  immediate reports of casualities.
Yemen erupted into open civil war between northern and southern forces on  May 5 as their political leaders had failed to agree on governing the country.
Troops loyal to Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Saleh, a northerner,  have  opened up two fronts to the north and northwest of Aden, which southern leader  Ali Salem al-Baid proclaimed the capital of an independent state on May 21.
Salah told officers in the Yemeni capital Sanaa that their troops had  launched "the last decisive battle against the band of rebels and separatists."
Yemen's deputy foreign minister, Abdel Kader Ba-Jammal, later Tuesday  declared that northern forces were in control of the Lahij region, close to  Aden, a statement denied by southern authorities.
Ba-Jammal said northern units had "cleaned out all pockets of resistance"  in the district, notably Taour al-Baha, 45 kilometers (28 miles) northwest of  Aden.
"All the major objectives in the Aden district are now within range of  legal forces," he told reporters in Sanaa.
But here in Aden a military source insisted that southern troops had  turned back the northern operation against Taour al-Baha.
"Our armed forces inflicted fatal blows on the invaders," he said in  comments carried by Aden Radio and monitored by the BBC.
