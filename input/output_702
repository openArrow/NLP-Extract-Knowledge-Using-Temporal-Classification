Taiwan's China Airlines (CAL) Sunday announced it  would give record compensation of 4.1 million Taiwan dollars (154,716 US) to  the families of Taiwan victims killed in a plane crash in central Japan.
"We have decided to compensate 4.1 million dollars to each of the families  of the victims killed in the crash, and the amount will be applied to the  relatives of both Japanese and Filippino victims," CAL spokesman Michael Lo  told reporters here.
Reports have said the relatives of Japanese victims are planning to file a  lawsuit in Japan seeking more than 47 million Taiwan dollars in compensation  each.
The crash at Nagoya Airport killed 264 of the 271 people onboard the CAL  Airbus 300-600R April 26.  Preliminary investigations have indicated that the  crash was due to a combination of pilot and mechanical error.
Of the victims, 101 were from Taiwan, 136 from Japan and the rest from the  Philippines.
