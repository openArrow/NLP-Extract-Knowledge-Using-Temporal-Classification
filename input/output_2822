Israel will keep the Gaza Strip completed sealed  until Palestinian security forces have set up their own checkpoints to ensure  against further attacks on Israelis, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said  Saturday.
"We will close the Gaza Strip until Palestinian police have set up their  own roadblocks 200 metres (yards) from Israeli crossing points," Rabin told  journalists here.
"The Palestinian police must ensure that no armed Palestinians can reach  the crossing points."
The Israeli army cordoned off the whole Strip Friday after two of its  soldiers were killed in an attack by Islamic militants at Erez, the main  border crossing from Gaza into Israel.
Israeli authorities earlier said the area would remain sealed until May 29.
The soldiers were gunned when three men in a car raked a roadblock with  automatic weapons fire in a Friday dawn attack claimed by Islamic Jihad, which  is opposed to the peace process.
They were the first Jewish troops killed since Israel and the PLO signed  an accord on May 4 to launch self-rule in Gaza and Jericho.
A Palestinian roadblock was also set up near Erez Friday, an AFP  photographer reported.
Rabin also warned Palestinian authorities that further attacks against  Israelis could stall the ongoing autonomy process in the occupied territories.
But he added that the violence had been a consequence of Israeli  occupation  and "were a signal of the Palestinians' refusal to live under the  yoke of another people".
Earlier Saturday in Gaza City, the head of the Palestinian police force  Nasr Yussef said joint Israeli and Palestinian patrols had begun operating in  the Strip.
Nine began to patrol in the Strip and two were operating in the self-rule  enclave of Jericho on the West Bank, a Palestinian police source said.
