Mary Pierce stormed to another incredible victory at  the French Open here on Sunday and publicly admitted for the first time that  she had "no regrets" over the major decisions she has had to make concerning  her family.
The seemingly unstoppable 19-year-old dropped only two games to  18th-ranked South African Amanda Coetzer to move just one match away from a  probable semi-final against defending champion Steffi Graf, and said: "I have  never been happier."
The 12th-seeded Pierce, who has not dropped a set and who has conceded  only four games in as many matches since the Championships began last Monday,  added: "I have never felt like this. And I don't think I can play any better."
The once anxious and tight-lipped Canadian-born teenager has been  transformed into a relaxed, smiling and confident professional since coming  under the wing of American coach Nick Bollettieri late last year.
"We have a really good complicity," she said, adding: "I owe him an awful  lot."
Just twelve months ago Pierce was beaten in the annual clay-court event by  American Jennifer Capriati.
It was a tournament marred by off court drama and incidents -- her  American father Jim being escorted out of the stadium for rowdy behaviour and  subsequently banned from attending all women's events.
Pierce, who now travels with her French mother, bother and Bollettieri and  his assistants, said: "I haven't seen my father since December but I have  phoned him on occasions.
"But all that is in the past. Everything has turned out for the best."
Her 63-minute victory over 22-year-old Coetzer, recent winner at Prague  and responsable for putting sixth-seed Kimiko Date out of the tournament in  the first-round, put Pierce into a quarter-final clash against Austrian Petra  Ritter.
Ritter, who celebrated her 22nd birthday on Tuesday, ended the hopes of  Romanian Ruxandra Dragomir, who defeated Bulgaria's 13th seed Magdalena  Maleeva in the first-round 7-6 (7/2), 4-6, 6-0.
