Justice Minister Dullah Omar said Friday that he  was preparing legislation to abolish South Africa's death penalty in line with  the policy of the ruling African National Congress.
There are currently about 400 prisoners on death row in South Africa's  jails, although there have been no executions since November 1989, when the  previous white-minority government imposed a moratorium.
"For the time being the moratorium will remain in place," Omar told  parliament. "Keeping a single person on death row and in suspense gives me  sleepless nights."
The demise of hangings would mean convicted killers like Clive Derby-Lewis  and Janusz Walus, the assassains of communist leader Chris Hani, would escape  the noose.
Derby-Lewis and Walus could also walk free under the terms of amnesty  legislation also being prepared by Omar.
The justice minister told parliament a bill providing for amnesty for  political crimes committed before December 6, 1993, would soon be submitted.
Omar said in order to receive indemnity from prosecution, a person would  have to fully disclose their crimes.
"The stories of David Webster, Matthew Goniwe and Steve Biko must be  heard," Omar said, referring to the killings of three prominent anti-apartheid  activists, allegedly at the hands of the state.
