A nine-year-old girl who did not like her teacher  bribed classmates to blackmail him with false accusations of sexual abuse,  Chicago police said.
The disgruntled schoolgirl paid her classmates a mere dollar to lie about  their teacher, 43-year-old Albert Thompson, police said.
Thompson told police that his class at an elementary school in Chicago's  rough South Side neighborhood got unruly on May 9, when he was brought in as a  substitute teacher.
When he threatened to report the raucous bunch for misbehavior, the girl  offered 10 of her friends a dollar each if they told the school they had been  fondled by Thompson, police said.
But police cleared Thompson when the children gave inconsistent statements  and two of them, including the ringleader, admitted they had made the story up.
"What's so scary and so sad is that you've got nine-year-old kids  sophisticated enough to know they can get a teacher by saying they fondled  him," said Jackie Gallagher, the Teachers Union spokeswoman said.
The school is now deciding how to best punish the lying youngsters.
