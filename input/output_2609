Aden authorities announced early Saturday the  creation of an independent state in South Yemen.
Announcing the secession from the north, the south's leader Ali Salem  al-Baid said in a televised address: "I proclaim the creation of the Yemeni  Democratic Republic as an independent state with its capital in Aden."
The proclamation was announced four years after the reunification of North  and South Yemen.
The two sides have been at war since May 5.
Al-Baid said the new state would be governed by the same constitution as  that in force in the north.
He also announced the formation of an interim council of national  salvation, adding that elections would be held within a year.
Late Friday the unified Yemen government, based in the northern city of  Sanaa, had called a three-day ceasefire in the civil war, to come into effect  from Saturday 00:00 a.m. (Friday 2100 GMT), the SABA news agency said.
Northern leaders presented the truce as "a last chance to the (southern)  separatists ... to end their rebellion, adhere to the constitution and place  their troops under the command of the head of state" in Sanaa.
