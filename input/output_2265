A proposed southern hemisphere international  tournament "has a long way to go to become reality," acting New Zealand Rugby  Football Union (NZRFU) chairman Rob Fisher said here Friday.
The competition has been proposed by South Africa and Argentina, but has  grudging support only from Australia.
Fisher said that if Australia did not want the competition it would not  start. NZRFU council Thursday agreed in principle to the concept, but the  approval was subject to a feasibility study and evaluation on marketing and  financial aspects.
The likely tournament shape was discussed at a recent meeting in Buenos  Aires. The likely timing for such a tournament would be over two weeks in the  middle of May in non-World Cup years.
A Super 10 provincial southern hemisphere tournament has been run for the  past two years, featuring top provincial sides from South Africa, Australia  and New Zealand.
