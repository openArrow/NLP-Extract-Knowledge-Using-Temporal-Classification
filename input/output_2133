The dollar fell again Thursday on European markets  against the German mark, with dealers saying they were surprised by the  greenback's poor performance despite rises this week in US interest rates.
The dollar finished the session here at 1.6553 German marks against 1.6580  Wednesday.
It rose however against the yen, to 104.15 from 103.45, due largely to a  major buy order, London traders said.
Volume was light and should remain so Friday because of the long Pentecost  weekend, with most European markets closed Monday. A bigger-than-expected drop  in the US trade deficit for March had no effect on trading, dealers said.
Among other currencies, the French franc got a boost when the Bank of  France dropped two key interest rates, rising to 3.4204 francs to the mark  from 3.4237.
The Portuguese escudo was essentially unchanged, closing at 103.2 to the  mark, compared to 103.1 on Wednesday.
The Italian lira rose to 957.1 to the mark from 958.1 as dealers welcomed  the Italian senate's vote of confidence Wednesday evening in Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi's government.
The Greek drachma remained under pressure, slipping to 148.98 to the mark  from 148.64.
