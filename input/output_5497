Rival Iraqi Kurdish factions met in Silopi,  southeast Turkey, on Monday but failed to agree on an end to their month-long  clashes in northern Iraq, Kurdish sources said.
Officials from the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and Patriotic Union of  Kurdistan (PUK) emerged from the meeting near the Iraqi border, organised by  Turkey, without making any comment to journalists.
But Kurdish sources said the officials failed to make any progress in  efforts to halt the fighting which has claimed more than 100 lives since the  start of May and split northern Iraq into PUK and KDP-controlled zones.
Tehran Radio said Monday that thousands of Kurds had fled their homes amid  renewed fighting in Qala Diza, Suleymaniyeh, the Haj-Omran region of Halabja,  near the Iranian border, and in Arbil.
Northern Iraq has been under Kurdish control since it was established with  the help of the US-led coalition which drove Iraqi occupying forces out of  Kuwait in February 1991.
