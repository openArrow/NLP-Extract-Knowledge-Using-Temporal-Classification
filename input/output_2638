The Greek parliament voted Friday night to set up a  commission to probe corruption allegations against former conservative prime  minister Constantine Mitsotakis over the sale of cement works Aget-Heraklis to  the Ferruzi group of Italy.
Of the 300 deputies, 174 voted to set up a committee of enquiry to  clarify the circumstances of the sale of Aget-Heraklis to the group's  Calcestruzzi subsidiary.
Calcestruzzi chairman Lorenzo Pansavolta has already been cited in  connection with corrupt practices under investigation in Italy.
The Greek move follows a report to parliament from a judge investigating  the sale of the cement company, in which he accused Petros Papageorgiou, a  Mitsotakis aide, of "lack of probity" and former Aget number two Nikos  Georgiadis of "breaching the law on middlemen."
Georgiadis has admitting receiving a 12 million dollar commission from the  Italian buyer of Aget, but his lawyer said he had gone back on earlier  statements implicating a businessman close to Mitsotakis.
If the committee decides against Mitsotakis, he and two of his former  ministers also being probed will face trial by a special court of supreme  court judges and parliamentary deputies.
Mitsotakis, meanwhile, said the sale had been "impeccable" and that he had  "no confidence" in the Socialist majority in parliament.
