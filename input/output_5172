A Nepalese peacekeeper abducted two weeks ago in  an ambush that left five colleagues dead was freed Sunday, the United Nations  said.
The peacekeeper was wounded during the clash but appears to be in  satisfactory health, said a spokesman for the UN mission here, George Bennet.
Bennet said he had no details on the soldier's release, but that he  believed the kidnappers received nothing in exchange.
The soldier was abducted from a Mogadishu hospital after the assault by  Somali gunmen on May 16.
