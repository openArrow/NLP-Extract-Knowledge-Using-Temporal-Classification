The United States said Thursday it had expelled  Iraqi's top diplomat in Washington for activities incompatible with the rules  governing the Iraqi interest section.
State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said the diplomat, based in  Washington, Adnan Malik, had engaged in political activity and other actions  violating a 1991 agreement with Baghdad.
"He was asked to leave the United States because he engaged in activities  incompatible with the limited mandate of the Iraqi interest section," McCurry  said.
"There's a protecting power arrangement, which was agreed to by Iraq in  April of 1991, that spells out exactly those activities which the interest  section may engage in. The arrangement prohibits all other activities unless  expressly authorized by the Department of State in writing," he added.
The interest section based in the Algerian embassy handles the limited  diplomatic contacts since Washington and Baghdad broke off relations in 1991.  The United States has an interest section in the Polish embassy of Baghdad.
McCurry said the activities included sending out news releases on the  Iraqi parliament's invitation to Kuwaiti parliamentarians to come to Bagdad  for talks on the World Trade Center bombing and making unauthorized contacts.
Malik was seeking to operate as a "full-fledged diplomat, but in this case  he had very correct restrictions on his activity based on the agreement that  we have, and his activity was clearly impermissible and outside the scope of  that agreement," said McCurry.
The Washington Post reported earlier that Malik had been lobbying members  of Congress and otherwise campaigning to lift the UN economic embargo against  his country.
McCurry said Malik had been warned to cease the political activity prior  to his expulsion.
Malik has left the country but his wife and children have been allowed to  remain in the United States until the end of the school year, the spokesman  said.
