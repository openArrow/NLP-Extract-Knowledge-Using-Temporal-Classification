The Free Democrat Party (FDP) is to withdraw its  candidate from Monday's presidential election here ahead of a third and  decisive vote by a special federal assembly, FDP officials said.
Analysts said the Liberals' decision made Roman Herzog almost certain to  be the next German president in succession to Richard von Weizsaecker.
The withdrawal of Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher would clear the way for a  left-right fight between Herzog, of the ruling Christian Union parties, and  the opposition Social Democrats' candidate Johannes Rau.
But the FDP members of parliament and delegates, whose weight will be  decisive, also voted amongst themselves, by 69 to 40, to support Herzog rather  than Rau in the secret ballot, party officials said.
Herzog, who was already the favourite, led in the first two rounds.
