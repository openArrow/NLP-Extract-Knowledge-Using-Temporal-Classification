prediction
WASHINGTON, May 23 (AFP) - The US economy is expected to grow by 3.6  percent this year, the best performance since gross domestic product (GDP)  grew 3.9 percent in 1988, top business economists said Monday.
The National Association of Business Economists said the US economy would  grow more than expected because of increases in productivity and despite  higher interest rates.
The association also predicted less inflation for 1994. Business  economists predicted the consumer price index would grow 2.8 percent this  year, down from three percent in 1993.
But, they predicted, prices would rise 3.4 percent in 1995.
