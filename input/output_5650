The Indonesian government had little immediate  reaction to a Philippine Supreme Court ruling allowing an East Timor  conference outside Manila to proceed, saying it would wait "to evaluate the  result of the conference itself."
"If that is what the supreme court has ruled, then the conference is going  to start, but we understand that the foreigners are still banned ... that is  the most important point for Indonesia," Foreign Ministry spokesman Irawan  Abidin told AFP.
Indonesia's leading human rights organization Tuesday hailed the court  decision lifting a lower court ban on the privately organised conference on  the former Portuguese colony.
"It is very good ... we are again shown a lesson that the democratic  process in the Philippines is truly functioning," said Hendari, a lawyer with  the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation.
"We can learn a valuable lesson on democracy from the Philippines, that  the government cannot intervene at will into the affairs of society," said  Hendardi, communications director with the fundation.
Jakarta, which unilaterally declared East Timor its territory in 1976,  considers the conference beginning Tuesday interference in its internal  affairs.
Manila, which said it had no authority under the constitution to ban the  conference, tried to placate Jakarta by denying foreign participants entry to  the Philippines. Ten foreigners have been denied entry.
