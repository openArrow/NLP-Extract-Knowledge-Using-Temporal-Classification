North Korea's ageing president, Kim Il-Sung, has  been absent from official events for almost three weeks since meeting a group  of Chinese visitors on May 7, South Korean officials said Thursday.
"Kim has failed to appear on the news or for official events and outdoor  meetings," said a monitor at the South's unification ministry.
The 82-year-old Kim has often been absent from public events for extended  periods in the past, but his absence this time caused speculation here because  of international tension between over Pyongyang's nuclear program.
The unification ministry official said Kim had not been seen on television  or heard on radio since May 7, when he received family members of a Chinese  friend.
"But we have no information monitored here or words indicating he is in  trouble," he said.
More recently, Kim's condition was known to have been stable, he added, a  view which coincided with those of foreign newsmen who talked with him in  Pyongyang on his birthday April 15 and described him then as "hale and  hearty."
