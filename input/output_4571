India plans to conduct tests soon of an  indigenous air defense system similar to the Patriot used by US troops against  Iraqi Scud missiles during the Gulf War, the Asian Age newspaper reported  Friday.
The air defense system consists of state-of-the-art phased array radar  combined with the medium-range surface-to-air Akash, or "Sky," missile, the  newspaper said.
Scientists at the Defense Research and Development Organization told the  daily that the Rajendra phased array radar can track several targets at once  and guide a missile in for a mid-air kill.
"It's a fantastic system. Its capability has put India firmly on the world  radar map," a radar specialist was quoted as saying.
The radar was designed and built at the Electronics and Radar Development  Establishment in the southern city of Bangalore.
