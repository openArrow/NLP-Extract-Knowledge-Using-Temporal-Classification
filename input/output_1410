The British government Tuesday adopted broad and  far-reaching shipping safety standards aimed at averting ecological disasters  such as the 1993 Braer oil spill off the Shetland Islands.
Transport Secretary John MacGregor told the House of Commons the measures  included publishing full details of detained ships to expose "unsafe operators  and ineffective flag states."
He said he had asked the Coastguard to "consider urgently" a  recommendation in the Donaldson Report, commissioned after the Braer tanker  sinking, to provide three salvage tugs.
"I will make further reports to the House in due course on the progress  made in implementing individual recommendations," said MacGregor.
"The owner or operator of a sub-standard ship must know that his ship is  certain to be inspected and that if it is found to be defective it will be  detained," he said.
Henceforth, Britain would "publish monthly the full details of the ships  we detain, their defects, their flags, their owners and those who operate or  certify them," he said.
"Such public exposure will mean that unsafe operators and ineffective flag  states will not be be able to hide their identities."
He said the government would identify possible "marine environmental high  risk areas," where shipping would face restriction or prohibition.
The backbone of the report, said MacGregor, was the "the principle that  the polluter, or potential polluter, should pay... The government endorses  this approach."
The Braer, flying a Liberian flag with a Greek and Philippine crew,  spilled some 84,000 ton of crude oil after running aground and scuttling in a  storm off the southern Shetlands.
