The state of Mississippi has filed an  unprecedented lawsuit against the tobacco industry to have it foot the health  bill for people killed or stricken by tobacco-related illnesses and diseases.
"The lawsuit is premised on a simple notion: you cause the health crisis,  you pay for it. The free ride is over," state Attorney General Mike Moore said  on filing the legal action Monday.
Although Mississippi seeks no specific damages in its lawsuit, an aide to  Moore said taxpayers in the state spend around 200 million dollars a year in  tobacco-linked health problems.
Moore said the state has taken a year to build its case that the taxpayer  should be spared paying medical costs for such illnesses through programs such  as Medicare (health care for the elderly) and Medicaid (health care for the  poor.
A manager at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. of Winston Salem, North Carolina,  called the lawsuit "an unprecedented ploy," adding that smokers "choose to  smoke fully aware of the risks they are taking."
The tobacco industry, in its latest bid to defend itself from a relentless  federal and public campaign against the hazards of smoking and second-hand  smoke, this week launched a series of newspaper advertisments minimizing the  problems of second-hand smoke.
