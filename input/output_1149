Vietnam denied Tuesday that four monks imprisoned  last year following protests in the central city of Hue are on hunger strike  and are seriously ill.
A foreign ministry spokesman dismissed as "totally false" a report by the  Paris-based International Buddhist Information Bureau (IBIB) that the four  members of the dissident Unified Vietnamese Buddhist Church were on a hunger  strike to protest their conditions at the Ba Sao re-education camp south of  Hanoi.
The monks were arrested and charged with "disturbing public order" after  demonstrations in the former imperial capital of Hue last May 24. They were  sentenced to prison terms of three to four years after a trial in November.
In a statement released in Paris, the IBIB called on the Vietnamese  government to allow representatives of the United Nations and the  International Committee of the Red Cross to visit the monks.
Hanoi denies oppressing Buddhism, pointing to the repair or renovation on  nearly all the country's more than 4,000 pagodas in the past three years and  the increase in the number of monks and nuns from 17,000 to more than 20,000.
They maintain, however, that all Buddhist "sects" should be integrated  into the Vietnam Buddhist Church, which was founded in 1982 under the umbrella  of the Communist Party's Fatherland Front.
The foreign ministry spokesman reiterated Hanoi's stance that the monks  were tried legitimately for causing public unrest. The protest flared after  monks thought police had come to arrest the head of the Link Mu pagoda in Hue.
