Tom Lehman fought off the effects of the 'flu  here Saturday to put himself in the driver's seat going into the final round  of The Memorial golf tournament with one round to play.
Lehman, who let the third-round lead get away in the Masters last month,  took advantage of a two-shot swing at the final hole to stretch his lead to  four strokes over fellow American John Cook.
"With a four-shot lead, basically it's your tournament to do what you want  with," he said. "I'm in the driver's seat."
Lehman put together his third straight five-under-par round of 67 for a  total of 201.
Cook, with a 69 for 205, was the only player within striking distance.
"He is playing beautifully," Cook admitted. "Very much in control of his  game. I don't think anybody else could win unless they shoot something really  low. If I put some pressure on, you never know. But I'll have to do it early  or the game is over."
Donnie Hammond and David Edwards were on 208, followed by Australian Greg  Norman, Bob Estes and Mark Brooks on 209.
Lehman, who woke up with a stomach ailment, said he did not eat all day  and was in pain throughout most of the round.
Though he was exhausted by the end of the round, Lehman sank a 15-foot  birdie putt at the 18th as Cook took bogey with a three putt.
"I felt awful when I started the day," he said. "But sometimes, when you  don't feel well, you slow down. I slowed down all day, but that gave me a good  tempo, good control. Being sick may have been a blessing in disguise."
American Bob Tway enlivened the day with a hole in one at the 12th -- his  second of the tournament. He holed a 155-yard nine-iron, two days after his  first-round ace with a seven-iron at the 187-yard eighth.
Even so, Tway was out of the title chase after a 69 for 217.
