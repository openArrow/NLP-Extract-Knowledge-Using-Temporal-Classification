Stefan Edberg's bid to win the only major title that  has always eluded him was nipped in the bud by fellow-Swede Henrik Holm at the  French Open Tennis Championships here on Tuesday.
The 28-year-old third-seed, unable to master blustery conditions on a day  when matches started half-an-hour late because of early morning rain and  finished in fierce sunshine, crashed 5-7, 6-7 (1/7), 7-6 (7/2), 7-6 (10/8),  4-6 in over four' hours.
Edberg was not the only casulaty among the favourites.
On the same court earlier in the day Gabriela Sabatini failed to pass the  first hurdle for the first time in ten campaigns at the world's most gruelling  tournament, when she lost in three grinding sets to Italy's Silvia Farina.
Kimiko Date and Zina Garrison-Jackson also bit the dust to join first-day  casualties Martina Navratilova and Magdalena Maleeva on the sidelines
Edberg, spured on by an uruly crowd, staged a magnificent comeback but  paid the price for eighteen double-faults -- most of them early in the match.
It was the first time Edberg had lost to his 26-year-old compatriot in  four meetings and the 37th-ranked Monte Carlo-based Holm fully deserved a  second-round showdown against Javier Frana of Argentina.
Frana put out MaliVai Washington of the United States in straight-sets.
Edberg, who reigned as world number-one for 72 weeks from 1990, appeared  to have got over his disastrous 1993 season during which he won his only title  at Madrid, by triumphing at this year's tournaments in Doha and Stuttgart. And  he had big hopes of winning the prestigious title at his eleventh bid.
His best previous effort was in 1989 when he was thwarted in the final by  Michael Chang.
