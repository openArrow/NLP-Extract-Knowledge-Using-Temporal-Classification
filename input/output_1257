The government Tuesday warned pro-independence  activists against holding the so-called Second Constitutional Convention of  Taiwanese People, saying it violates the law.
The conference and its organizing unit, the Committee of Taiwanese  Constitutional Movement, have never been registered with authorities and are  illegal, said the Interior Ministry, which governs domestic affairs.
It was referring to the committee's seeking a new national flag and anthem  for the country after it splits from China to become an independent republic.
The committee Tuesday started running advertisments in local newspapers  appealing to the public for ideas.
Legal experts here said that as long as no violence or actual acts take  place during the convention, what will be said in the meeting still falls  under freedom of speech, and any new flag and anthem chosen will fall within  the range of freedom of expression.
Taiwan bans actions to turn the island into an independent republic. The  government here, driven off the mainland after losing a civil war to the  Chinese communists in 1949, still regards itself as the legitimate ruler of  all of China and that Taiwan will eventually be reunited with the mainland.
