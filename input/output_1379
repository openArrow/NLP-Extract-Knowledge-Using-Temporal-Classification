British Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind Tuesday  warned the warring factions in Bosnia not to take the presence of UN forces  for granted, but he refused to predict when British troops would be withdrawn.
He cautioned against the United States arming the Bosnian Moslems  following a vote in the US Senate in favour of lifting the UN weapons embargo.
"If the United States was freely arming the Bosnian Moslems, there would  be enormous pressures on the Russians because of their historic close ties to  the Serbs," Rifkind told BBC Radio.
Britain has the second largest UN troop contingent in Bosnia behind  France, whose prime minister, Edouard Balladur, has said he would have to  consider withdrawing his contingent unless all the major powers committed  themselves to a peace settlement.
French Defence Minister Francois Leotard announced Tuesday in Paris that  France would cut its peacekeeping presence by more than one-third in the  former Yugoslavia, pulling out 2,500 soldiers by the end of the year. France  currently has some 6,800 troops stationed in ex-Yugoslavia.
Rifkind agreed the idea of troops sitting through another bitter Bosnian  winter with the war raging around them was "a grim scenario" which Britain  would work to avoid.
"The fighting factions should not take the presence of the UN forces for  granted," he said.
If the war went on, then the question of the UN's presence would become an  issue, he said. "There can't be guarantees in this sphere."
