China has indicated its readiness to consider  possible voluntary export restraints to curb the explosive growth in Chinese  textile exports to Japan, government sources were quoted as saying Friday.
The evening edition of the Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted international trade  and industry sources as saying that Chinese trade officials had informed the  ministry they were "studying" introduction of export controls.
The newspaper said the Chinese move was aimed at discouraging Japan from  restricting imports of textiles from China under the 1974 multilateral fibre  arrangement of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
But it also noted that a bilateral deal to "voluntarily" restrict the flow  of textile trade between the two countries could attract international  criticism of Japan while damaging China's bid to join the GATT.
The ministry refused to confirm the report but did say that Yukio Doi,  director general of its consumer goods industries bureau, was scheduled to  visit Beijing from May 23 for "regular" talks with Chinese trade officials.
Japan's imports of Chinese textile soared 31 percent to almost eight  billion dollars in the year to March, accounting for almost half of the  overall 24 percent jump in imports from the country to 21.7 billion dollars.
Japanese and Chinse officials, meanwhile, ended two days of economic  consultations here Friday, government sources said.
Chinse officials from the State Planning Commission were quoted as telling  officials from Japan's International Trade and Industry Ministry that retail  prices in China in the first three months of this year jumped about 20 percent  from a year earlier.
News reports said that the officials agreed to discuss Japan's industrial  cooperation with China in the field of motor vehicle parts.
