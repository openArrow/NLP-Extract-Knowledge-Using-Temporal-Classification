Imran Khan was right to resign from the  International Cricket Council after he admitted tampering with a ball, it was  claimed on Monday.
ICC chief executive David Richards said: "It's sad that a player of  Imran's ability found it necessary to interfere with a ball.
"Having made his admission, his resignation is an entirely appropriate  action."
Imran, who retired after the 1992 World Cup, admitted in a biography  earlier this month he lifted the seam of a ball and also scratched its surface  with a bottle top while playing for Sussex during a championship match against  Hampshire in 1981.
"Ball-tampering was simply not an issue in those days and certainly not  the mortal sin it is now considered to be," said Imran in a newspaper column  on Monday.
Meanwhile Younis Ahmed, another former Pakistani international player, has  claimed that Imran used Vaseline, a bottle top and even a mini screw-driver to  work on the ball and make it swing more during a 1987 Test match in India.
Imran, one of the game's greatest all-rounders, describes that  unsubstantiated allegation as "concocted nonsense" and says he intends to take  legal action.
Younis has also written to the ICC detailing the claims against Imran but  Richards said no action would be taken.
"We won't be doing anything with the letter," said Richards. "We are not  in the business of involving ourselves with what one individual says about  another."
The ICC clearly believe that ball-doctoring is a problem that no longer  exists in international cricket following a toughening up of the laws and the  introduction of neutral country umpires.
"In the year I have been doing this job, no instances of ball-tampering  have been reported to me," said Richards. "I think the chances of it arising  again are minimal."
After years of rumour and innuendo, ball-tampering finally became a public  issue in 1992 when then England batsman Allan Lamb accused Pakistani pair  Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis of cheating.
