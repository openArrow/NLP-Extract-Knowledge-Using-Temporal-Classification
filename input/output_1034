Breyer is virtually assured a swift confirmation -- likely a reason he was  chosen over Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt who has alienated some Western  senators by requiring cattle-ranchers to pay more to graze their stock on  federal land.
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, a Republican from Kansas, and two other  Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, Alan Simpson from Wyoming and Orrin  Hatch of Utah, said they would vote for Breyer and predicted an easy  confirmation.
Breyer was passed over last year when Clinton tapped Ruth Bader Ginsburg  as his first Supreme Court appointment.
