Japan's Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. on Tuesday announced a  group pre-tax loss of 202.4 billion yen (two billion dollars) in the year to  March, almost doubling the previous year's loss of 108.1 billion yen.
The nation's second largest carmaker said global sales fell 6.4 percent to  5,801 billion yen with a net operating loss of 86.9 billion yen, hit by a  higher yen and a continuning slump in the Japanese and European markets.
Nissan, however, forecast a pre-tax profit of 4.1 billion yen for the  current year to March 1995, with sales of 3,584 billion yen, expecting  domestic sales to pick up in the second half of the year.
"The sharp appreciation of the yen and the decrease in unit vehicle sales  in the domestic and European markets due to the continued weak demand severely  affected the total net sales," the company said in a statement.
Heiichi Hamaoka, Nissan's executive managing director, said, "I regret to  say that we recorded a heavy loss because our vigorous cost-cutting measures  and extensive rationalisation efforts could not offset the impact of the  appreciation of the yen and slumping demand in the domestic and European  markets."
In volume, global sales of all types of cars fell 13 percent to 1,763,886  units, with domestic sales edging upward 0.7 percent to 1,133,896 units, but  exports plunging 30 percent to 629,990.
Nissan's global production fell 7.4 percent to 2,743,281, with domestic  output dropping 14.1 percent to 1,749,814, but overseas production gained 7.2  percent to 993,467.
"We cannot expect a quick recovery of our profitability because prospects  of the European markets are still uncertain," Hamaoka said, but added that the  domestic car demand was expected to recover in the second half of the year.
"Amid this tough business environment, we intend to improve our  profitability by accelerating further our on-going restructing programs and  cost-cutting and rationalisation effort," he said.
