A Senegalese appeals court Thursday threw out  murder-related charges laid against the country's main opposition leader,  Abdoulaye Wade.
The Dakar Appeals Court dismissed the charges against Wade and his wife  Viviane after the May 15, 1993, slaying of the deputy president of the  Constitutional Court, Babacar Seye.
The court also dropped charges against two parliamentarians of the  Senegalese Democratic Party, Ousmane Ngom and Abdoulaye Faye. Wade is the  secretary general of the party.
The four had been charged with involvement in the murder last October but  not detained.
