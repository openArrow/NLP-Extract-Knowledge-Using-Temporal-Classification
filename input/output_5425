With Goran Ivanisevic the only seeded player left in the bottom-half of  the the draw, Dreekmann now has a great chance of reaching the semi-finals.
His opponent in the next round will be 46th-ranked Swede Magnus Larsson --  better known as a doubles player and responsable for putting out ninth-seeded  Todd Martin in the previous round.
Larsson, 24 two months ago and winner of the Zaragoza tournament in March,  beat Jaime Yzaga of Peru in straight-sets on a blustery but sun-drenched  centre-court 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 in just under two hours.
The unspectacular 6ft 3in Swede produced a competent performance against  the 26-year-old South American clearly out of form and still feeling the  after-effects of his gruelling five-set win over 1989 Michael Chang on  Saturday.
