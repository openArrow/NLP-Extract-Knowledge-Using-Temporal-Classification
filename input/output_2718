Prime ministers Viktor Chernomyrdin of Russia and Yefim Zviagilski of  Ukraine will discuss the crisis in Crimea Monday in a bid to ease tensions in  the peninsula after Friday's parliament vote on independence, ITAR-TASS news  agency reported, citing Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev .
Kozyrev urged Kiev and Simferopol "not to repeat the tragedy in Yugoslavia  where everything started after a call for sovereignty followed by an ultimatum  to impose respect of state integrity."
"Nobody says that Crimea must no longer be part of Ukraine," Kozyrev said,  adding that people must understand that the "use of force is useless."
A Crimean assembly official meanwhile said the parliament would not go  back on Friday's decision.
Crimean legislators are however ready to enter talks with the Ukrainian  parliament to resolve the crisis, said Sergei Nikulin, head of the  parliament's majority Russia group which is presided by pro-Russian President  Yuri Meshkov.
Nikulin is to have talks Tuesday with Ukrainian legislators, according to  Interfax news agency.
