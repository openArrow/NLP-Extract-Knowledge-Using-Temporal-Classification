Michael Stich hopes he has got his  day-off out of the system following an inept straight sets defeat to Alexander  Volkov here Thursday just four days before the French Open.
"I did everything wrong that I could. There was no special reason it was  just not my day but I prefer to play like that here rather than in Paris," the  German said after Volkov gave the Russians a 1-0 lead in their World Team Cup  match.
Volkov, who had lost five consecutive matches since last beating Stich in  1989, won 6-4, 7-6, taking the tie-break 7-5.
Pete Sampras gave the United States a 1-0 lad over France by beating  Cedric Pioline 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) and then complained his serve needed to improve  for Paris.
"My serve needs to be better," the world number one said. "If my serve and  forehand aren't effective at the French Open it could be a pretty long day."
