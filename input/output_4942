A crowd of 40,000 radical students  from across the country staged an overnight rally here Saturday to inaugurate  a nationwide federation of activists.
The students, who took buses and trains to converge on this southwestern  city, a hotbed of anti-government feeling, burned US flags and stabbed at  effigies of US "imperialists" with sharp-edged bamboo sticks.
The students hold the US reponsible for not intervening to stop the  killing of more than 200 people during a crackdown of a popular uprising here  in 1980.
The killings were committed by South Korean martial law troops, but  students and dissidents claim the US was reponsible because its troops had  command control over South Korean forces.
Police said 15,000 riot police troops, many of them reinforcements from  other cities, were positioned at street corners and outside government and  ruling party offices to prevent violence.
But they said they would allow the students to hold an anti-US rally  scheduled on Sunday outside the South Cholla provincial government building,  where dozens of protestors were killed during the 1980 uprising by martial law  troops.
Street clashes were expected after the Sunday rally, when students said  they planned to march on the US cultural center and the ruling Democratic  Liberal Party office in Kwangju.
