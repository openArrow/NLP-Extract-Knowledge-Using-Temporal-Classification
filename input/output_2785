The Russian parliament has decided to split use of  the building which until last November housed the Lenin museum between itself  and the Moscow history museum, Interfax news agency said Saturday.
The Duma will set aside one large reception hall inside the red-brick  baroque building near Red Square for its own use, with the history museum  taking over the rest.
Before the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, the site housed Moscow's first state  Duma.
Last November, Russian President Boris Yeltsin decided in the wake of  October's bloody stand-off between his supporters and the parliament to have  the Lenin memorabilia moved to the Duma.
The memorabilia of Vladimir Ilytch Ulyanov, the father of the revolution,  includes his Rolls Royce and a coat showing a bullet hole from a botched  attempt on his life.
The collection also includes archive film from his funeral, along with  assorted books, letters and photographs.
Many of the items were quickly put in boxes and removed from the site late  last autumn.
With the building in need of repair, the Duma has not been moved there and  has continued to sit in the Mossoviet, seat of the former parliament.
Last March, deputies indicated in a letter they would refuse to back  Yeltsin's proposition of moving the Duma to the museum, saying they preferred  that the history museum use the building.
That museum has already been set up in another building of similar style  at the entrance to Red Square.
