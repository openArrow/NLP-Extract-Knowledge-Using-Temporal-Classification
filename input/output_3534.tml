<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><TimeML><TIMEX3 tid="t0" functionInDocument="CREATION_TIME"/>Samarkand, one of the brightest  jewels of Moslem architecture, is slowly <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">crumbling</EVENT>, <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">condemned</EVENT> by the methods  of its builders, unsuitable restoration techniques and a lack of funds to  <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">ensure</EVENT> its permanent survival.&#13;
Grass is <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">growing</EVENT> on the celebrated blue domes at this crossroads of the  old Silk Road, and cracks have <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">appeared</EVENT> in the walls of the Tila Kari, one of  the finest of the Koranic schools and mosques that make up the complex known  as the Registan.&#13;
Some of the blame can be <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="can">laid</EVENT> on the Emperor Tamerlane himself, who <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">died</EVENT>  in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE">1405</TIMEX3> and whose mausoleum is one of the oldest monuments in the city.&#13;
"At that time a sovereign did not <EVENT eid="e8" class="I_STATE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="NEG" modality="none">want</EVENT> his achievements to <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">outlast</EVENT> him,"  <EVENT eid="e10" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT> Claude Rapin, a Swiss archaeologist and an expert on ancient Samarkand.&#13;
For this reason, he <EVENT eid="e11" class="I_ACTION" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">explained</EVENT>, the buildings were <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">constructed</EVENT> in brick,  instead of stone, and the joints in the masonry were <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">filled</EVENT> in with clay, and  not a more durable material.&#13;
For Rupin, the monuments of Samarkand <EVENT eid="e14" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">require</EVENT> complete renewal <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION">every 10  years</TIMEX3>, or in other words an unending restoration process.&#13;
But the restoration <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">works</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">carried</EVENT> out under the Soviet rule of Uzbekistan  did more harm than good, as a recent <EVENT eid="e17" class="REPORTING" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">report</EVENT> of the United Nations Educational,  Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">stressed</EVENT>.&#13;
A basic principle of conservation is to <EVENT eid="e19" class="I_ACTION" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">avoid</EVENT> the <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">use</EVENT> of materials other  than those employed originally, the report <EVENT eid="e21" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">noted</EVENT>. But the ceilings of the  mausoleum were <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">patched</EVENT> up with papier-mache, ancient walls were <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">buttressed</EVENT>  with reinforced concrete and upper floors were <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">rebuilt</EVENT> with concrete instead  of brick, <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">putting</EVENT> an intolerable strain on foundations.&#13;
In addition, local irrigation systems pumping out subterranean water  rendered the earth looser, endangering the stability of walls and causing  <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">rising</EVENT> damp.&#13;
The result is evident from the grass <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">growing</EVENT> from the summets of the domes  and minarets of the university Tamerlane's grandson Ulog Deg, a noted  astronomer, <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">built</EVENT> in the heart of the Registan between <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE">1417</TIMEX3> and <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE">1420</TIMEX3>.&#13;
This building, and Ulog Deg's observatory, are the priorities for repair  work to be <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">carried</EVENT> out by the Uzbekistan authorities <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE">this year</TIMEX3>, the 600th  anniversary of the sage's birth.&#13;
But the Samarkand local government <EVENT eid="e30" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">announced</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE">last week</TIMEX3> that the only funds  it could <EVENT eid="e31" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="could">come</EVENT> up with were 1.5 billion som-coupons, the equivalent of 50,000  dollars.&#13;
