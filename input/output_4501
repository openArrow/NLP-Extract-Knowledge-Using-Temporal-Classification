Four gunmen who hijacked a bus and took its  passengers hostage flew out of the southern Russian town of Mineralnye Vody  Friday aboard a helicopter with their last four hostages, police said.
Police general Ivan Tetereviatnikov said the gunmen had earlier been paid  eight million dollars to release the other passengers, and given arms and  morphine.
He said the helicopter, which had a crew of four, was flying "toward the  east."
