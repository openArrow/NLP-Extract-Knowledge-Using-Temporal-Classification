Interior ministry elite troops captured Friday  three of the four gunmen who hijacked a schoolbus one day earlier and the  remaining four hostages have been released, Interfax reported quoting interior  ministry sources.
The hijackers were seized shortly after they landed in the Caucasus  republic of Chechnya aboard a helicopter.
The fourth hijacker was surrounded, Interfax said.
