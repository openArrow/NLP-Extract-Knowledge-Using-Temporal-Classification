Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing indicated  Thursday that Beijing had no intention of reversing its decision to give a US  oil company rights to explore for oil in territory disputed with Vietnam.
Li said that while Beijing would continue "friendly consultations" with  Hanoi on overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea, these talks  would cover only disputed territories, not territory belonging to China.
"In regards to indisputable territories, there is no question," he told a  business opportunities conference here organised by the New York-based Asia  Society.
Li was asked whether China would keep a pledge to its Southeast Asian  neighbours to keep the peace over territorial disputes in the Spratly islands.
The islands, which reputedly sit atop vast deposits of oil and gas, are   claimed in whole or part by Brunei, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan  and Vietnam.
Crestone, a Colorado-based oil company, announced last month that it  planned to drill into the Tu Chinh sandbar, about 400 kilometers (250 miles)  southeast of Vietnam's coast, under terms of a concession signed with China.
But Vietnam, which claims that the Tu Chinh sandbar is well within its  special economic zone and continental shelf, has demanded Crestone halt all  operations in the area, saying any exploration is illegal.
Li welcomed remarks by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet at the same  conference Wednesday that Hanoi would pursue its claims in the South China Sea  "through peaceful negotiations and in an atmosphere of friendship."
He said that Beijing still believed that claimants should jointly develop  disputed areas.
Kiet told the Straits Times daily in an interview published Thursday that  while Hanoi would defend its territory, it saw no reason to use force in Tu  Chinh because of improvements in ties with China.
The Chinese and Vietnamese navies fought a brief but bloody engagement in  the Spratlys in March 1988. Hundreds of Vietnamese were believed to have been  killed in the fighting.
