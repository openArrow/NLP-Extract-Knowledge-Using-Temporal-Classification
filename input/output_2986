Russia wants "more serious and deeper relations with NATO than those  foreseen in the Partnership for Peace," Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev  said, quoted by the ITAR-TASS news agency.
Grachev who is to travel to Brussels to meet NATO leaders Tuesday and  Wednesday reiterated that Moscow wants to be given a greater status in any  relationship with NATO, reflecting Russia's great power status.
"We are going to propose another partnership plan, already approved by the  president (Boris Yeltsin), Grachev said.
"Its main principles are that the adhesion to the programme must take into  account the considerable role and place of Russia within the European security  system and the United Nations," the minister said.
