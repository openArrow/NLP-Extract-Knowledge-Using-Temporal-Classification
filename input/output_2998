International relief organizations will start  evacuating up to 5,000 Somali refugees from the war zone in southern Yemen to  a safer location further north on Monday, a senior UN official said here  Sunday.
UN Resident Coordinator in Yemen Awni al-Ani told reporters a  representative of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees on Sunday visited the  new site 50 kilometers (30 miles) to the north and "found it suitable for  refugees."
The Somalis have been without food and water at the al-Koud camp on the  south coast since the war started on May 5. They will be moved to a site by a  river northeast of Jaar.
Ani also said two 18-tonne trucks carrying wheat flour, oil and beans,  were sent Sunday to al-Bayda, about 180 kilometers (100 miles) northeast of  al-Koud.
The rations were enough for up to 5,000 people for two weeks.
The agreement to relocate refugees came after talks Saturday between the  governor of the Abyan region, east of Aden, and the UNHCR and International  Committee of the Red Cross. The refugees "agreed with the solution," Ani said.
He did not know how many Somali refugees had been killed in shelling of  Al-Kud since the war began but refugees there told reporters Friday about 500  were killed and 800 wounded.
About 1,500 refugees remained in Al-Kud and hundreds more were scattered  in nearby villages, Ani said.
The food was being provided by the World Food Program. The ICRC had  already delivered medical supplies to the refugees.
The evacuation would go on all day and through the night, Ani said.
Another senior UNHCR official, Nicholas Coussidis, said it would take  several days for the new tented camp to be set up. Food would be waiting for  the refugees when they arrived in trucks.
The front line was 17 kilometers (10 miles) west of Al-Kud on Friday.
