<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><TimeML><TIMEX3 tid="t0" functionInDocument="CREATION_TIME"/>Roman Herzog, favourite in the race for president, is  is undeniably the most conservative of the four candidates.&#13;
Aged 60, with an imposing high-domed forehead and a glittering eye behind  metal-rimmed spectacles, he has the reputation of <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">enjoying</EVENT> the good life and  and an ironic turn of phrase.&#13;
Herzog, a jurist by training, has been president of Germany's important  constitutional court since <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE">November 1987</TIMEX3>, which he <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">joined</EVENT> as vice-president in  <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE">1983</TIMEX3>.&#13;
A member of the Christian Democrat Union (CDU) since <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE">1970</TIMEX3>, he was born  <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE">April 5, 1934</TIMEX3> at Landshut in Bavaria, the son of a museum curator, and is an  active protestant evangelist.&#13;
As education minister of Baden-Wuerttemberg, he <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">distinguished</EVENT> himself by  <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">taking</EVENT> the Latin matriculation examination anonymously to <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">underline</EVENT> the  importance he <EVENT eid="e6" class="I_ACTION" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">attributes</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">study</EVENT> of the language, and <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">passed</EVENT> brilliantly.&#13;
While in the region's interior ministry, he <EVENT eid="e9" class="I_ACTION" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">insisted</EVENT> that 300 student  demonstrators who <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">occupied</EVENT> an American military intallation <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">pay</EVENT> the 25,000  marks cost of the police operation to <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">evacuate</EVENT> them.&#13;
He also <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">introduced</EVENT> CS gas and rubber bullets for the regional police.&#13;
But despite the severity of his outlook, he has regard for the rules of  law, and the court he presides over has, for example, <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">come</EVENT> out firmly in  favour of the right to <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">demonstrate</EVENT>.&#13;
To questions of whether he is to the right or left, Herzog <EVENT eid="e16" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">prefers</EVENT> to  <EVENT eid="e17" class="REPORTING" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">reply</EVENT> with a riddle.&#13;
<EVENT eid="e18" class="I_ACTION" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">Asked</EVENT> his plans for the presidency, he invariably <EVENT eid="e19" class="REPORTING" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">replies</EVENT> that his aim is  to be "a figure of unity" and "a champion of the citizen in the face of the  state and the parties".&#13;
Not the first choice of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and hesitant to <EVENT eid="e20" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">throw</EVENT> his  hat in the ring when his name did <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">come</EVENT> up as a late runner, he <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE">now</TIMEX3> <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">looks</EVENT> the  perfect conservative candidate.&#13;
