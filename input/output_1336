The board of the London Financial Futures and  Options Exchange (LIFFE) said on Tuesday that it had made a "conclusive  decision" not to adopt the Globex international trading system operated by  Reuters.
LIFFE chairman Nick Durlacher said that the decision had been taken  because "restrictive conditions" made the system "totally unacceptable" to the  LIFFE board. A spokesman for the Reuters said that the decision was  "disappointing."
The Globex trading system is an after-hours screen-based system which was  developed jointly in 1992 by the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), the Chicago  Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the British financial information company  Reuters.
The Deutsche Termin Boerse is due to make a decision on whether to adopt  Globex later this week.
Durlacher said the LIFFE was "concerned with optimising the international  distribution of LIFFE's products outside the European time zone."
He said the LIFFE's "strategic priority" was to develop bilateral links  "along the lines of our successful partnership with the Tokyo Stock Exchange  for the Japanese Government Bond (JGB) contract, and our ongoing negotiations  with the Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange regarding a fungible  link for the Euroyen contract.
Durlacher said the terms on which participation in Globex was offered  "would have denied us further development of our preferred linkage strategy,  and would have meant withdrawal from our TIFFE Euroyen discussions.
"In addition, we would have been precluded from extending the current  automated trading system (APT) beyond its current hours of use," he said.
The CBOT abandoned the Globex system on April 16 after concluding an  accord with Bloomberg Financial Products, a rival to Globex.
Currently, the CME uses the Globex system, while the French MATIF futures  market has taken the system since March 1993.
The price of Reuters shares fell by 13 pence to 479 by midday.
