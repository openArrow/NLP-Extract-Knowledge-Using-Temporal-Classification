Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi Wednesday dismissed  calls to dump neo-fascists from his cabinet as he headed for a confidence vote  in the Senate.
"I cannot accept a different government," he said during Senate debate.
"For the government to change there would have to be new elections,"  Berlusconi insisted.
