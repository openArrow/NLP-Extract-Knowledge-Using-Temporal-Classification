Peace talks with Syria are blocked and US  Secretary of State Warren Christopher is thus unlikely to visit the region as  expected in early June, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Tuesday.
"The negotiations with Syria are totally frozen because they want a  commitment for a total withdrawal from the Golan which I am not prepared to  give them," state radio quoted Rabin as saying.
"Therefore a new visit to the region by Secretary of State Christopher,  which was due in early June, would not make much sense.
"So it is probable that he will delay it until later," Rabin reportedly  told the closed door session ofthe parliamentary foreign affairs and defence  committee.
"If there is nothing to negotiate the Syrians will not go to the bilateral  negotiations in Washington and that's why no date has been set for their  resumption."
Christopher shuttled between Jerusalem and Damascus at the end of April  and in mid-May saying the negotiations had entered a "substantive" phase. But  he failed to set up a new round of direct talks.
Publicly both sides have refused to shift from their pre-conditions.
Israel has demanded a Syrian commitment to total peace with open borders  and full relations before revealing how far it is prepared to pull back on the  Golan Heights which were seized in the 1967 Middle East war.
The bilateral negotiations were suspended on February 27, two days after a  Jewish settler killed 30 Moslems in a Hebron mosque.
