Hale Irwin birdied the last three holes  Friday to complete a six-under-par 64 and the lead after one round of the  rain-disrupted Colonial golf tournament.
Irwin was one of the 53 players stranded on the Colonial Country Club  course Thursday when thunderstorms stopped play.
He had four holes left when he returned Friday morning and birdied three  of them. Irwin, 48, said he would not have minded carrying on with his second  round, but he was in a group of players scheduled to play their second rounds  early Saturday morning.
"Today was the day to keep playing," he said. "The ball had eyes. It was  the kind of putting feel you'd like to continue, but I only got four holes."
In contrast, 57 golfers who did not get on the course Thursday were  scheduled to complete 36 holes Friday and take Saturday morning off.
Then the halfway cut would be made, and the remaining players were to  complete the third round Saturday afternoon and get back on schedule for  Sunday's closing round.
Irwin said his lead was unlikely to stand up, especially since golfers  were being allowed to lift, clean and place their balls in the sodden fairways.
"I'd be very surprised if there wasn't a 62," he said.
With the first round complete, Zimbabwe's Nick Price and South African  David Frost shared second on 65.
Japan's Hajime Meshiai and Americans Scott Simpson, John Cook and Tom  Lehman were all on 64.
