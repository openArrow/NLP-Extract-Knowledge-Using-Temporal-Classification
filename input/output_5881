The United States said Tuesday that North  Korea's refueling of a nuclear energy facility in defiance of international  inspectors could jeopardize any basis for talks between Pyongyang and  Washington on normalizing relations.
The White House underlined US concerns after the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) said Pyongyang had accelerated the pace of removing fuel  rods at a facility, which could make it impossible to determine whether  plutonium had been diverted to weapons purposes.
Spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said new talks sought by Pyongyang on helping  North Korea's economy could be suspended if the communist regime persists in  its defiance of inspectors.
"We said that there would be no obstacles to continuing a third round (of  talks) if the North Koreans first completed the March inspections, and second,  allowed the refueling to take place in a way that did not break the continuity  of safeguards," said Myers.
State Department spokesman Michael McCurry offered a similar analysis of  the situation.
"At any point that the IAEA notifies us that there's no longer an ability  to understand the operating history of the reactor, that has been effectively  destroyed, the premise for our dialogue with North Korea will simlarly have  been destroyed," said McCurry.
President Bill Clinton and his South Korean counterpart Kim Young-Sam  spoke by telephone for about 20 minutes Monday to reaffirm their support for a  UN Security Council message urging North Korea to allow a resumption of  inspections.
Myers added that even if the IAEA determined that weapons-grade plutonium  may have diverted, Washington consult with the UN Security Council.
"At that point the question will go back to the Security Council where  we've said we'll work with the other members and expect to take this step by  step," she said.
