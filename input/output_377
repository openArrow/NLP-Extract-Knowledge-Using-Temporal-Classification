Italy's new prime minister, media magnate Silvio  Berlusconi, met the US ambassador to Rome Friday for a "cordial" conversation,  the premier's office said.
Ambassador Reginald Bartholomew passed on US President Bill Clinton's  congratulations to Berlusconi who formed his government this week, more than a  month since general elections, the office said.
Clinton, due to meet Berlusconi in Rome next month, wished the country  success in its renewal process and said he expected to work in close contact  with him for a further strengthening of an already strong bilateral  partnership.
Some western observers have expressed concern about the new cabinet, which  includes neo-fascists from Berlusconi's coalition partners for the first time  since the rule of wartime dictator Benito Mussolini.
Addressing some of those fears, new Defence Minister Cesare Previti sent a  message to NATO, US Defence Secretary William Perry and the Western European  Union underlining his "determination to work on the foundations of traditional  Italian involvement" in western defence and security structures.
He said the encouragement given by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation  and strong relations with the United States "constitute fundamental points of  reference for Italy, with the construction of a credible European security  profile."
