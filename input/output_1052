The US ambassador to Damascus will protest to the  Syrian government over an article in an official newspaper alleging "Jewish  propaganda" in the American press, a US official said Monday.
The Syria Times published an editorial headlined "Israeli minsinformation  campaign" on Saturday, the eve of the arrival of US Secretary of State Warren  Christopher.
The English-language daily accused some American newspaper correspondents  of being in the pay of Jewish organizations.
"The Jewish organizations are everywhere ... in the service of Israel's  ambitions of expansion and occupation," the English-language official  mouthpiece charged.
It gave a list of Jews working for two of the leading US dailies, the New  York Times and Washington Post.
The high-ranking US official said: "That kind of story, in any  circumstances, anytime, is not helpful.
"(The ambassador was) instructed to take it up with them (Syrian  authorities)."
Christopher travelled Monday night to Israel, the second leg of his  mission to try to bring the two neighbours back to the peace table.
