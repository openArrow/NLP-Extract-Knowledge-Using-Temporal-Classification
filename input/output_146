Seven people died in three and a half weeks  of political tension between rival groups at the Western Areas gold mine west  of here, National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) spokesman Jerry Majatladi said  Friday.
Majatladi said "politically motivated" fighting between supporters of the  Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the African National Congress  (ANC) started on April 17, nine days before South Africa's first non-racial  election.
He said one person was killed on April 17, two others died in fighting  during the April 26-29 poll and four were killed Wednesday.
Nelson Mandela's ANC won the election, while the IFP came in third after  the National Party; members of the three parties make up the government of  national unity that was announced on Wednesday.
