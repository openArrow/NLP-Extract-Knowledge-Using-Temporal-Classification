France would not join a US military invasion of  Haiti as part of an effort to restore democratic rule, French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe said Thursday.
Juppe, in Washington for talks with US officials, said he told US  President Bill Clinton that Paris had ruled out participation in such an  invasion force, which has been suggested as an option by Clinton and urged by  some members of Congress.
"I confirmed that military intervention to kick out the military  leadership is out of the question for us," Juppe told reporters in Washington.
The French diplomat meanwhile reiterated his condemnation of the military  regime in Port-au-Prince and the naming Wednesday of interim president Emile  Jonassaint, whom Juppe described as a "puppet with no legitimacy."
He said France was working to enforce the latest UN Security Council  resolution calling for stiffer sanctions if the military refuses to leave  power and restore democracy by May 21.
France also was prepared to participate in a UN multinational force to  help train a new Haitian police force once democracy is restored, Juppe noted.
Juppe said such a force was in the process of being sent to Haiti last  October before the collapse of an agreement to restore exiled president  Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
In an implicit criticism of US handling of the matter, Juppe said,  "Unfortunately the boat (with US and Canadian troops) turned back because  there were a few people making noise on the port."
