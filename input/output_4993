More than a million Latvians prepared Saturday to  vote in local elections ballots from which 700,000 ethnic Russians have been  excluded under a strict citizenship law.
Some 1,260,000 Latvians will be called to vote Sunday to elect 4,771  councillors for three-year terms, but Russian-speakers -- most of whom moved  to the country under Soviet rule -- will remain disenfranchised unless they  are granted naturalisation.
Parliament is currently debating conditions under which ethnic Russians,  who make up about one quarter of Latvia's 2.6 million population, can gain  Latvian citizenship.
In the capital Riga, where native Latvians are in a minority, almost  two-thirds of the population will be excluded from the vote.
Observers see the poll as a test for the centre-right government of Valdis  Birkavs, under strong attack from a radical and nationalist opposition opposed  to treaties signed with Russia giving demobilised Russian troops the right of  abode in Latvia.
Latest opinion polls give the National Independence Movement (LNNK) 16  percent, and a further 10 percent to a nationalist alliance in favour of  sending most ethnic Russian civilians back to Russia.
"If we can take Riga municipal council, we can take a majority of the  seats in parliament," said LNNK candidate Baiba Petersone.
Latvian Way, the mainstay of the ruling coalition, was forecast to take  just six percent of votes cast.
