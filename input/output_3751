A policeman, injured in clashes with spectators at  one of Hanoi's notorious motor rodeos -- illegal motorcycle races in the  centre of the capital -- has died of his injuries in hospital, it was reported  here.
The local newspaper Hanoi Moi said Tuesday that he was fatally injured in  the clashes April 30, the eve of May Day celebrations.
Twenty-five police have been injured in similar clashes since the illegal  races began late last year, according to police reports.
The races have become a focus of gambling and are regular events on the  eve of traditional festivals. At least four people have been killed and nine  injured among racers and spectators at the events.
The policeman's death occurred Saturday, two days before two Hanoi youths  were tried for their involvement in the disturbances.
Truong Tuan Anh, 22, was jailed for 22 months for illegal racing and  disturbing public order, said the paper.
Spectator Nguyen Xuan Thi, 18, was jailed for 10 months for trying to stop  a policeman filming the race and spectators. About 200 riders were involved  with up to 5,000 onlookers around lake Hoan Kiem, a tourist spot in the  capital.
