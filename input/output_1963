Britain has raised the possibility of a UN pullout  from Bosnia unless the warring factions there can settle their differences in  about eight weeks, the Foreign Office confirmed Thursday.
A spokesman said Foreign Office Minister of State Douglas Hogg told a  private group in London Wednesday night that the Bosnian Moslems "have to  recognize military defeat" and give up the notion of recovering lost territory  by force.
"Time is running out," Hogg was quoted as saying. "We have eight weeks or  so" to see positive developments in the peace process, or else UN troops would  consider pulling out.
The British ultimatum followed an announcement by France of possible cuts  in its 6,000-strong force in the former Yugoslavia.
France, and Britain, which has about 3,000 troops there, are the two  largest contributors to the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in the former  Yugoslavia.
The Foreign Office spokesman said Hogg's remarks, made from extemporaneous  notes, had been in the same spirit as the French position that the deployment  of UN troops in Bosnia would not be indefinite.
The two-month period cited by Hogg, said the spokesman, was "merely a  guideline and did not mean a precise deadline had been set by anybody."
"Any eventual withdrawal of British troops would be in close coordination  with our partners," said the spokesman.
British Defense Secretary Malcolm Rifkind on Tuesday had warned that the  British UN continugent in Bosnia should not be taken for granted.
