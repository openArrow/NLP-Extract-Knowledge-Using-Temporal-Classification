The advantage is enough for Ford motor racing director Dan Rivard to seek  relief from Indy race officials. Most contenders here use his Ford-Cosworth  engines across the Indy circuit, but Penske could make them uncompetitive.
"We're working with the speedway so we can all work with the same  engineering," Rivard said. "The speedway is faced with some very tough  choices. They have to make the decision (on changing rules to kill the  Mercedes)."
Rivard and Cosworth's Steve Miller both said they could build an Indy-only  engine similar to Mercedes for next year if they must. New rivals Honda and  Toyota would likely do the same.
"We're not adversarial in this, but we want to know what's going on,"  Rivard said. "If the Penskes have any luck at all, they could be unstoppable."
Even rivals agree the Mercedes drivers ae likely to break the track  records set by Roberto Guerrero in 1992. They are 232.482 mph (371.971 km/h)  for a four-lap average and 232.618 mph (372.188 km/h) for a single lap.
"It's going to be ludicrous. We're here to qualify in the second or third  row," Britain's Nigel Mansell said.
Unser, who has tested the Mercedes over 520 miles, dislikes the favored  role, saying: "We're not a lock for the pole. You can have all the horsepower  and it won't matter unless you can get around the corner."
But his father, four-time Indy winner Al Unser Sr., likes what he sees  from his son's engine.
"We know the engine is capable. Penske doesn't let things sit back and  relax," he said. "Whether it will stand up on race day, nobody knows. I bet  you it will be a strong motor all day, though. Penske wouldn't come here  without a good idea it would hold up."
