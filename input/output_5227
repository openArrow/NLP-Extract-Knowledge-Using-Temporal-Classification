Cascarino, a flop at English Premiership side Chelsea, scored the first --  his 12th for his country -- with a far-host header after 31 minutes.
Ireland nearly extended their lead with 68 minutes on the clock, Jason  McAteer failing to make contact with Steve Staunton's left-wing cross right in  front of an open goal.
But then the 19-year-old Kelly produced a left-foot drive with just over  20 minutes to go and goalkeeper Godo Illgner was left stranded as it deflected  off defender Thomas Berthold.
The Germans, who had not been beaten at home for six years and have not  lost a match at Hanover since 1954, threw everything into a desperate late  assault.
But Matthias Sammer missed badly and even veteran Rudi Voller, brought out  of retirement for the World Cup, could not dislodge a heroic Irish defence.
Irish deputy goalkeeper Alan Kelly performed heroics to turn back the  German bombardment with a trio of thrilling saves.
Vogts said: "We helped the Irish with both their goals and although I  don't want to be too critical of the players, because they are not at their  peak yet for the World Cup.
"Ireland showed us how to play simple and successful football but I must  say we gave them some assistance."
