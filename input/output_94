Israeli officials handed over  at least three buildings to Palestinian police officers in the early hours of  Friday as a small crowd of residents who had stayed up all night cheered on.
The Israeli flag was lowered and replaced by the Palestinian flag at the  central police station, the post office and a court house. The sites were  transferred formally to some 20 officers who had crossed over from Jordan on  Thursday.
