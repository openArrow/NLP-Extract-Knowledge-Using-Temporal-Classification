The German stock market plunged this week due to  weakness in the bond market and hints from Bundesbank chairman Hans Tietmeyer  that the central bank had ruled out further interest rate cuts for the time  being.
The DAX index of 30 leading shares closed Friday at 2,140.99 points, a  fall of 4.83 percent on the previous week.
Earlier in the week Tietmeyer said the May 11 half-point cut in its two  key interest rates "had cleared the horizon for some months," which the market  took as a signal that further trimming of lending rates in Germany was  unlikely.
His comment sparked big falls Tuesday, the markets having been closed  Monday for the Pentecost holiday.
The weakness of the dollar, which hit the competitiveness of German  exports, also affected market confidence, Commerzbank said.
The market rebounded Friday, however, mainly due to technical factors, but  dealers expect further falls before the index levels out again at around the  2,120 mark.
Stockbrokers said Frankfurt's fall was not linked to bad company news but  in response to short-term concerns due to uncertainty in the bond market.
In the medium-term the market was still on the up, thanks mainly to  expectations of improved company results in 1994 and 1995, Commerzbank said.
Among major quoted companies Thyssen, which announced Wednesday a sharp  reduction in pre-tax losses for the first half of the year, lost 19.50 marks  on the week, closing at 283.50 marks.
Karstadt fell 34.50 marks to 612 marks, despite profits having nosed  forward 1.2 percent.
Banks were also down, Commerzbank dropping 18 marks to 354.50, Deutsche  Bank 23.80 to 739.50, and Dresdner Bank 31 to 377.
Allianz tumbled 168 marks to 2.397 marks while Daimler shed 62 to close at  815 and Siemens 25.30 to 697.
In a week shortened by one day due to the Pentecost holiday, volume was  31.923 billion marks, compared to 39.719 billion previously.
Reacting to falls in the United States, the Frankfurt bond market was also  weak.
Wednesday's slight drop in the lowest rate of the repurchase rate -- by  three hundredths of a point to 5.20 percent -- and confirmation of a slowdown  in inflation in western Germany to 2.9 percent in May from 3.1 percent in  April, had only a limited impact on the market, brokers said.
Average yield on gilts reached its highest point of the year Thursday at  6.62 percent, before slipping back Friday to close at 6.58 percent, up from  6.40 percent the previous week.
Bond market volume was 99.626 billion marks in a shortened week, against  124.526 billion the previous week.
