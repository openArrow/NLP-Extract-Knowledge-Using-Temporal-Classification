The washout of the second one-day international  between England and New Zealand helped Warwickshire to victory in their Sunday  League game against Somerset.
Warwickshire captain Dermot Reeve, released by England when the Lord's  match was abandoned, dashed to Taunton and played a crucial role in his  county's five wicket triumph.
With his side behind the required run rate in the 20-over contest, and  having lost West Indian maestro Brian Lara for 11, Reeve blitzed Mushtaq Ahmed  for two sixes over long-on in the space of three balls to change the course of  the match.
Mark Lathwell hammered four boundaries in a bright 31 for Somerset.
England captain Mike Atherton also raced from Lord's to help his county  and, although he fell for two, he had the satisfaction of playing in  Lancashire's first victory over another county this season, an eight-wicket  defeat of Kent at Canterbury.
Competition bests by John Crawley (91) and Peter Martin (three for 15)  inspired Lancashire's success.
Hampshire openers Paul Terry and Tony Middleton shared an unbroken stand  of 159 to overwhelm Middlesex by ten wickets at Southampton.
Terry was the dominant partner, hitting sixes off Mark Feltham, John  Emburey and Paul Weekes as well as including six fours in his 91.
Middleton hit only two boundaries in his unbeaten 57 from 104 balls as  Hampshire cantered home with three overs to spare.
Surrey paceman Martin Bicknell whipped out the first five Northamptonshire  batsmen for 12 runs at The Oval, but his Sunday best figures were wasted as  the rain forced an abandonment.
Northants collapsed to 53 for seven in 22.3 overs.
The weather wiped out Derbyshire's match against Worcestershire at Derby,  Durham's game with Gloucestershire at Gateshead Fell and the  Nottinghamshire-Sussex fixture at Trent Bridge.
