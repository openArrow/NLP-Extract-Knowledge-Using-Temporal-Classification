It would not be in the United States' interest  to deny China its most favoured nation (MFN) status, Chinese Vice-Premier Li  Lanqing said here Thursday.
Responding to questions at a business conference, Li said: "MFN is  mutually beneficial and the basis for our bilateral trading relationship. The  granting of MFN status and preservation of MFN treatment is of fundamental  interest to our two countries."
Li's comments came as reports from Washington suggested US President Bill  Clinton was considering partial withdrawal of China's trading privileges. He  must decide on his course of action by June 3.
Clinton said last year that he would not renew China's MFN status unless  Beijing made "significant overall progress" on human rights.
Beijing has warned that it would retaliate against a withdrawal of MFN,  and Chinese Premier Li Peng said earlier this week that China would not  tolerate interference in its internal affairs.
Li Lanqing said he had not heard of proposals for limited penalities on  Chinese exports as an alternative to total withdrawal of China's MFN status  but commented that the privilege was "mutually beneficial" and important for  bilateral trade.
The three-day conference, organised by the New York-based Asia Society,  has attracted 800 business and political leaders, mostly from the Asia-Pacific  region.
Washington's decision to link China's MFN status to human rights has been   criticised by some Asian governments, worried that a withdrawal would cause  regional economic and political harm.
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong Tuesday warned that any move to cut  off Asia's booming economies from western markets could trigger the formation  of an Asian trade bloc.
"An Asian trade bloc is not an option of choice. But it is a viable  option," Goh told the same conference Tuesday.
Li said China would continue to modernise its economy, tap opportunities  abroad and provide conditions for foreign investors to prosper.
"China's development cannot do without the world and the world's  development needs China's participation," he said.
