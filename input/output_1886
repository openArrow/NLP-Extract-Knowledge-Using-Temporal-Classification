China published Thursday an ambitious poverty  elimination programme that aims to solve food shortages still plaguing 80  million rural Chinese by the year 2000.
The plan drafted by the State Council, detailed on the front page of all  national dailies, pledges to concentrate China's manpower, materials and funds  and to mobilise all sectors of society in realising its goal.
However, it also pointed out that serious natural obstacles would have to  be overcome.
"Although poor people constitute a small proportion of China's rural  population, the task for eliminating poverty is extremely difficult," the plan  said.
The majority of poverty-sticken Chinese live in some of the country's  harshest environments, such as high mountain ranges, deserts and loess  highlands.
The plan outlined seven goals for alleviating food shortages, including a  sharp increase in per capita earnings in most poor households and cultivating  stable and high-yield farmlands, orchards and woods.
At the same time, the problem of insufficient drinking water will be  solved, electricity provided to poor townships, primary education made  universal, adult illiteracy eliminated, vocational education promoted and  endemic diseases brought under control.
According to the plan, officials and farmers in poor areas will be  encouraged to re-orient themselves towards the market economy, developing  local resources and expanding commodity production.
Those peasants living in areas with extremely harsh natural conditions  will be relocated, it added.
Local governments will be required to increase funding for the programme  which also emphasises the importance of promoting exchanges and cooperation  with the international community in poverty elimination.
Governments in poorer counties will be banned from buying cars, building  luxury hotels or constructing office buildings as long as the food problem  among local residents persists, the plan said.
