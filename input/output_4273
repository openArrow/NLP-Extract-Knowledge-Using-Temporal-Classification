Four armed men took 30 people, including children,  hostage Thursday in a bus near the southern Russian town of Mineralnoye Vody  and demanded a 10 million dollars ransom, a helicopter, arms and drugs,  Russian authorities said.
Some 10 children were among the passengers being held hostage, police  chief General Ivan Tetereviatnikov told AFP by telephone.
The security forces deployed some 800 men around the bus, hijacked at 1:30  pm (0930 GMT), and started negotiations, he said.
The negotiations were being directed by Viktor Erin, Russian Interior  Minister and North Ossetian President Askarbek Galazov, he added.
The bus was travelling from Vladikavkaz, the capital of the Russian  Caucasus republic of North Ossetia, to Stavropol in southern Russia.
The Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations said the men were armed with  three submachine-guns and a grenade.
They demanded a helicopter -- without a crew -- as well as four  submachine-guns, a grenade-launcher, four flak-jackets, night-sight scopes,  and drugs, the ministry said.
The last hostage drama in Russia was in December when 15 schoolchildren  were abducted by four men in the southern city of Rostov-on-the-Don.
The hostage-takers obtained a helicopter and led authorities on a four-day  airborne pursuit through the Caucasus before releasing their hostages one by  one in return for 10 million dollars ransom, most of which was recovered.
Mineralnoye Vody is a major hub in the northern Caucasus region for  Russian flights.
