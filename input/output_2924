For Clinton to successfully extricate himself from the China box with both  domestic and foreign respect still intact is a far more difficult task than  dealing with Japan.
Mike Jendrzejczyk, of Human Rights Watch/Asia, said for Clinton to  maintain his honesty and credibility as a human rights defender, he will at  least have to impose partial sanctions, which would still anger Beijing.
"The United States loses face either way," said Clark, "because if the  United States doesn't remove MFN.... its going to look like we huffed and we  puffed and couldn't blow the house down."
Asians already think the United States "is a little bit crazy," he said.  But if the United States does remove MFN "we might convince them that we're  stupid. That would be unfortunate. We've gotten ourselves in a rather no-win  situation."
