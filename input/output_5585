New Zealand will produce a 422 million dollar  (248 million US) budget surplus during the the current fiscal year, the  Treasury announced in a statement here Tuesday.
If the prediction becomes reality it would be the first budget surplus  since the 1970s.
Financial markets had been expecting Tuesday's statement to point to a 350  million dollar budget surplus, indicating a strengthening economy.
Treasury said the main reason for the surplus was higher than expected  economic growth of five percent for the year.
Tax revenue was up 1,080 billion dollars on a pre-election forecast made  last October and government spending at 29,453 million dollars was down 617  million dollars.
Finance Minister Bill Birch said much of the revenue gain was due to  companies returning to profitability and paying tax. A big contributor to the  drop in spending was people moving off benefits and into work.
Treasury said it would cancel a government stock tender scheduled for June  9 because of the expected surplus.
