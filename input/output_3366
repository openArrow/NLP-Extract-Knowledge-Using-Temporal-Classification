Moroccan football has just emerged from the doldrums. They failed to  qualify for the 1990 finals and flopped in the 1992 African Nations' Cup.
German coach Werner Olk was fired after the tournament in Senegal and  Abdelkhalek Louzani was removed when their USA expedition ran into trouble.
Blinda gambled by opting to build a side made up mainly of players based  in Europe. He had had only one warm-up game, which they won 1-0 against Mali,  before the vital clash with Zambia.
So far he has been proved right.
Nourredine Naybet, who plays for French first division side Nantes, is a  stylish defender who is confident on the ball and can use it to telling effect.
Mohamed Chaouch, who has led Nice to the French first division play-offs,  is the dangerman, having scored five of the 19 goals in the qualifying  campaign.
