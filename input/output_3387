An Organization of American States (OAS)  commission accused Haiti's military Monday of murder and other serious human  rights abuses.
The Interamerican Committee on Human Rights, which traveled to the  Caribbean country last week, said the human rights situation had deteriorated  considerably and that it had reliable reports of 133 extrajudicial executions  since February.
The delegation said in a statement that most of the incidents occurred in  areas believed to be strongholds of support for ousted president Jean-Bertrand  Aristide.
The report said the military, which toppled Aristide in 1991, would  infiltrate villages on the pretext of flushing out subversives and then attack  or arrest residents, set fires and rob and destroy homes.
The military was carrying on a systematic campaign of intimidation and  terror against the Haitian people, according to the commission, which ended  its five-day trip to Haiti Friday.
