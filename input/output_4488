China welcomed Friday US President Bill Clinton's  decision to renew its most-favored-nation status this year and abandon his  linkage of trade to human rights, but criticised existing US sanctions against  it.
A foreign ministry spokesman said the decision would create favourable  conditions for further strengthening and expanding bilateral trade and  economic cooperation and help to improve relations between China and the  United States.
The spokesman, quoted by the Xinhua news agency, also expressed regret for  the existing US sanctions against China, and called for these measures to be  lifted at an early opportunity.
Clinton had linked renewal of China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) trading  status with "significant progress" in human rights.
On Thursday he admitted that "serious human rights abuses continue" in  China.
But he renewed MFN status and delinked it from human rights, saying the  policy had reached "the end of (its) usefulness."
The only sanction that Clinton imposed was a ban on imports of Chinese  guns and ammunition worth 200 million dollars a year -- less than one percent  of the 22-billion-dollar Chinese trade surplus with the United States.
There are also several measures that the United States applied after the  crushing of the pro-democracy movement in Tienanmen Square, whose fifth  anniversary will be on June 4.
These include barring China from participating in the US Trade and  Development Assistance Program and the US-Asia Environment Partnership  Program, and continued US opposition to "non-basic human needs" loans to China  by the World Bank and other multilateral development banks.
