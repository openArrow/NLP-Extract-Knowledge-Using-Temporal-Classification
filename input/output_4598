Heavy fog and rain Friday hampered Thai and United  Nations officials searching along the border with Cambodia for two missing  Belgians, one of them a UN employee.
But a member of the military's Suranari task force said a tape recording  had been found in the car the couple left near Preah Vihear temple in which  Michel Baran, 31, talked about his love for Cambodia's famed Angkor Wat temple  complex.
Police now are checking the possibility Baran and his girlfriend, Nathalie  Roobaert, 21, may be traveling overland to Angkor Wat, some 140 kilometers (87  miles) southwest of Preah Vihear.
Baran, a minerals expert for the Bangkok-based UN Economic and Social  Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), and Roobaert were reported  missing Tuesday when their car was found abandoned.
The Suranari officer, reached by phone from Bangkok, said Friday each day  that passed without a ransom demand being received lessened the possibility  they were kidnapped.
Khmer Rouge guerrillas, believed active in the area, have in the past  abducted foreigners and demanded ransom. But the Khmer Rouge have denied by  radio any knowledge of the missing couple.
