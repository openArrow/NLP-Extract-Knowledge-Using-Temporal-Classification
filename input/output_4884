Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Saturday sent a  telegram welcoming Nobel literature prize-winner Alexander Solzhenitsyn back  to his native land.
Yeltsin said he was "certain that your talent and your experience as a  historian and thinker will help us to rebuild Russia."
"There are still lots of problems in Russia and a lot to do to restore the  dignity of the country and its citizens," Yeltsin said, according to his press  service.
The speaker of the Duma (lower house of parliament), Ivan Rybkin, told the  agency Interfax on Saturday that his heart "rejoiced to see our best people  returning to their native country."
He said that if the writer wanted to visit parliament, "We will welcome  him with pleasure."
Solzhenitsyn, the chronicler of Stalin's labour camps, landed in the  Russian far east on Friday, ending 20 years of exile mainly spent in the  United States.
