At least 13 Pakistanis died in the stampede  during the annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, an official statement said here  Wednesday quoting information from Saudi Arabia.
Earlier in the day, Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar, responding to  questions from the upper house of the Pakistani parliament, had put the  casualties at 32.
But he could not give the breakdown of the dead and wounded, pending  details from Saudi Arabia, where the holiest Moslem shrines of Mecca and  Medina are located.
More than 90,000 Pakistanis went to Saudi Arabia this year for the  pilgrimage of Hajj, a duty that every Moslem who can afford it is expected to  perform at least once.
The incident took place when Moslems were performing the ritual of  "stoning the devil" in Mina, 10 kilometers (six miles) east of Mecca.
Witnesses said that more than 200 pilgrims, mainly Asian and Africans died  in the incident, while Indonesian officials put the toll at 252.
Saudi officials have yet to disclose an official figure, but authorities  said the overall number of deaths in the whole pilgrimage was 829.
The media have estimated the number of deaths to be about 1,000.
