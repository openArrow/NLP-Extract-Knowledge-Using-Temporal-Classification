China said Wednesday the economy would grow by 12  percent in the first half of 1993, two percentage points higher than its  target for the year.
In a report carried by all major newspapers, State Planning Commission  spokesman Wei Liqun said industrial output would grow by 18 percent from  January to June over the same period last year, while fixed asset investment  and consumer sales would rise by 30 percent and 22 percent respectively.
Wei was upbeat about figures for the first four months of the year, saying  they reflected the success of reforms implemented in recent months to bring  the overheated economy under control.
Industrial output grew 16.4 percent in the first four months over the same  period last year, while fixed asset investment rose 38.4 percent, Wei said.  The figures were down from some 25 percent and nearly 70 percent respectively  between January and April last year.
Wei also pointed to a recovery in state sector production in April, with  output increasing five percent over the same month last year.
The figure compared with a 2.2 percent rise in state enterprise output in  the first quarter of the year, when the loss-making sector was badly hit by a  tight credit policy aimed at controlling inflation.
Inflation was running at 20.1 percent nationwide and some 26 percent in  big cities in the first quarter.
The official said the slowdown in fixed asset investment had created a  stable supply of raw materials, predicting that this would help bring down  inflation in the second quarter of the year.
