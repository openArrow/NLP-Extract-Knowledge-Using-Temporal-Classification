US Secretary of State Warren Christopher held  talks Monday with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shara as the official press  called for a rapid Israeli pullout from the strategic Golan Heights.
A Western diplomat said Syria wanted an Israeli withdrawal to be completed  within three years while Israel is offering a five-to-eight year timetable,  starting with the return of three out of five Druze villages on the plateau.
Christopher, who was due to leave for Israel, met Shara for one hour but  no details emerged.
The US envoy had four hours of talks with President Hafez al-Assad on  Sunday, in the second meeting between the two men in as many weeks.
He was originally scheduled to leave Damascus late Monday after further  talks, but a US official said he had covered "all the topics he wanted to  discuss" and would be leaving for Israel sooner than expected.
The government Tishrin newspaper said that the success of Christopher's  mission depended on an "immediate Israeli withdrawal from the Golan according  to a well defined timetable.
Tishrin on Sunday said Syria was willing to negotiate an Israeli  withdrawal from the Golan on condition Israel pledged a complete pullout  within an "acceptable and reasonable" timeframe.
Christopher was expected to deliver Israel's response to Assad's  counter-proposals, following an initial Israeli offer of a phased withdrawal  from the Golan.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has offered to return three of five  Druze villages on the heights as a first stage in a three-step withdrawal over  five-eight years from the plateau which Israel conquered in 1967.
Syria rejected the offer and was likely to turn down Israeli proposals  that Christopher try to persuade Damascus to set up a joint military  commission with Israel to "draft security arrangements" for the heights.
