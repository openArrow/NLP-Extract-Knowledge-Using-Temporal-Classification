The Daimler-Benz engineering group expects to make  an operating profit this year in contrast to a loss of 3.3 billion marks (1.98  billion dollars) in 1993, company president Edzard Reuter said on Wednesday.
Reuter proposed that the company make a one-for-10 share issue to raise  233 million dollars to support growth.
The company reported that in the first quarter sales had risen by 19  percent to 22.02 billion marks from the figure for the same period of last  year.
The group comprises the Mercedes-Benz car firm, the DASA aero group, Debis  financial and computer services, and the AEG electrical engineering business.
The company said that it had "benefited by more than average from the  improvement in the world situation for cars which is also taking effect  progressively in west European markets".
Sales of cars had risen by 33 percent to 9.49 billion marks and of  commercial vehicles by 21 percent to 6.54 billion marks.
Sales in the United States had risen by 45 percent and in other countries  of the European Union by 28 percent. In Germany they had risen by 17 percent.
Sales of cars rose by 52 percent to 131,500 vehicles.
Overall sales in the United States had risen by 31 percent and in Germany  by 17 percent and in other European Union countries they had been steady.
Reuter said: "On the basis of the figures available to us, operating  results were again positive in the first few months of this year and we count  on a continuation of this trend for the whole of 1994."
The group had reported an operating profit of 400 million marks in the  last quarter of 1993 following a loss of 3.7 billion marks in the first nine  months of the year.
