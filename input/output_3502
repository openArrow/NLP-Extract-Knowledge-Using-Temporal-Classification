Sebastien Viars has won a late call-up for next  month's French rugby tour of Canada and New Zealand.
The Brive fullback replaces Stephen Ougier of Toulouse who has pulled out  with an injured left ankle.
The 22-year-old Viars, who can also play on the wing, was dumped by the  French selectors after earning his ninth cap in the Test defeat against  Argentina in 1992 when his place kicking deserted him.
