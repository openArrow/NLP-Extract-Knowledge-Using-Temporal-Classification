A four-month ceasefire in the former Yugoslavia  could be agreed by the warring factions within a matter of weeks said top UN  negotiator Lord David Owen Saturday.
But he warned that the peace initiative was entering a critical period and  progress must be made quickly.
"I think there's a fairly good chance getting a cease-fire in the next few  weeks," said Owen during an interview with CNN's "Evans and Novak" show.
"The Serbs want it to be a permanent ceasefire. The government forces want  it to be for a time limited; they say two months, but I think they'd probably  accept four months," he said.
Earlier on Saturday the United Nations announced its envoy Yasushi Akashi  had asked the warring factions in Bosnia-Herzegovina to negotiate a cessation  of hostilities in a meeting in Geneva next week.
The United Nations wants the factions to agree to a ceasefire and accept a  European partition plan giving 51 percent of the territory to a Croat-Moslem  federation and 49 percent to the Serbs.
Owen said that the next two months will be critical in trying to bring  about a lasting peace.
"I think we are at a point where we've got to make progress or things will  dramatically change," he said.
"This June, early July, is a very critical period. And I think it's very  likely this settlement will go to the crunch with a meeting between President  Clinton, President Yeltsin, Prime Minister Major, President Mitterand and  Chancellor Kohl," he said.
Owen added that the attitude for international cooperation "is better than  it's ever been before."
He said he expected the July meeting in Rome of the Group of 7 and Russia  to be key in finding an answer.
"I think at that stage these countries are really going to have to talk  turkey and come to a solution," he said.
