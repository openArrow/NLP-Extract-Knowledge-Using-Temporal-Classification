The world's biggest reclining Buddha will be  officially inaugurated on a hill in China's Guangdong province Wednesday.
The 16-metre (53-foot) high and 108 metre (356 feet) long statue will be  blessed by officials of the Buddhist Association of China and Tibetan Buddhist  Association in Sanshui city, 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Guangzhou.
The hill in the southern province was chosen because local Buddhist  religious records claim a monk had a vision of Buddha there, according to  local Chinese press reports.
The Sanshui authorities have developed the site into a nature reserve.
