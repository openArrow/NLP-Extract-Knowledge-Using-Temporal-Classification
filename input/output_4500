China has expelled a number of foreign reporters  for breaking reporting regulations, foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said  Friday.
"Several journalists violated regulations concerning news reporting so the  Chinese cut short their period of stay," he told a press conference.
Wu did not say how many had been expelled or give their nationalities, but  indicated that they included South Koreans and had been reporting in eastern  China.
The official news agency Xinhua reported that the group included a South  Korean, Kwon Heung-Soon, who works for the radio and television network Mon  Hwa Broadcasting Company (MBC).
