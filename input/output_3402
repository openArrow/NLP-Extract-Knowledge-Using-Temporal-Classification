Japan's Fujitsu Ltd. plans to triple the ratio of  overseas sourced components and materials from 10 percent to 30 percent of  total purchases by the fiscal year ending March 1997, a spokesman said Tuesday.
The move is aimed at improving earnings by using overseas-made parts,  which have become more price competitive due to the yen's appreciation, the  spokesman for the nation's computer giant said.
Fujitsu plans to set up a parts procurement base in Taiwan and increase  purchases from China, the spokesman said.
The company currently has a similar office in Singapore to buy materials  from about 40 firms in Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia, he said.
Fujitsu's total purchases of parts and material now amount to 1.2 trillion  yen (11.5 billion dollars) a year, including 600 billion-to-700 billion yen  from Fujitsu affiliates, the spokesman said.
Fujitsu, which is to announce Thursday its earnings report for the year to  March, has forecast its sales in the period would fall 9.9 percent to 2.16  trillion yen, mainly due to an estimated 15.4 percent drop in sales of  computers, which account for about 70 percent of turnover.
