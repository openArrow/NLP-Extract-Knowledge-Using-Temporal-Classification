The world market for new airliners will be worth 980  billion dollars in the 20 years to 2013, a senior Boeing executive said on  Tuesday.
The vice president for marketing within the Boeing Commercial airplane  group, Richard L. James, said aircraft costing 249 billion dollars would be  purchased to replace existing airliners.
A further 731 billion dollars would be invested in extra planes to cope  with an increase in airline traffic, he said in a statement received here.
Boeing is the biggest manufacturer of airliners in the world, and claims  to account for about 60 percent of the world market.
The European Airbus consortium is believed to hold about 30 percent of the  market, and the US company McDonnell Douglas 10 percent.
James said that there were only 600 airlines in the world and that of  these only 125 purchased new planes. The 20 biggest companies bought 60  percent of new commercial airliners.
In such a concentrated market, a manufacturer could not afford to make a  single strategic mistake, he said. Air traffic was closely linked to economic  recovery, and he forecast that the demand for new airliners would increase  quickly, particularly in Asia.
Boeing estimated that passenger traffic would increase by five percent a  year overall during the next 20 years and the increase would be strongest in  the Asia-Pacific region.
