The dollar remained weak in Europe on Thursday and  held its ground only because dealers feared central bank intervention, dealers  said.
The dollar closed at 1.6415 marks from 1.6440 at the close here on  Wednesday and at 104.30 yen from 104.45.
The dollar continued to be undermined by turbulence on financial markets  since Wednesday which has given the mark refuge status.
At the Bank of America economist Jeremy Hawkins said that dealers feard  intervention by central banks if the dollar fell below 1.64 marks.
Central banks might use the approach of a long weekend in Britain and the  United States to take more effective action over the rate of the dollar.  Dealers had begun to buy dollars as a precaution, he said.
The market had expected the decision by the Bundesbank to maintain its  discount rate at 4.5 percent and the Lombard rate at six percent.
The dollar appeared to have found a floor level against the yen of 104 yen  following announcement on Tuesday that the united States and Japan were  resuming trade talks.
Hawkins said that the room for the dollar to fall against the yen appeared  to be limited.
The mark rose against European currencies and mainly against the escudo  which fell to 104.50 to the mark from 103.50 on Wednesday despite intervention  by the Bank of Portugal on Wednesday and the suspendsion on Thursday of the  repurchase and certificates-of-deposit rates. They were replaced by a tender  arrangement.
The mark again firmed against the drachma which has been under pressure  for two weeks, and was quoted at 150.30 drachmas from 148.05, and against the  lira to 972 lire from 968.
The French franc was steady at 3.42 to the mark as were Scandinavian  currencies. The Swedish krona was at 4.7175 to the mark from 4.7225.
The dollar was being quoted at 1.6415 marks from 1.6440 on Wednesday, at  104.30 yen against 104.45, at 1.3995 Swiss francs from 1.4012 and at 5.6213  French francs from 5.6238.
Sterling was at 1.5110 dollars from 1.5103, at 2.4803 marks from 2.4829,  at 157.60 yen from 157.75, at 2.1146 Swiss francs from 2.1162 and at 8.4937  French francs from 8.4936.
