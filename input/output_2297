North Korea has begun removing fuel rods from its  Yongbyon reactor in a "serious violation" of International Atomic Energy  Agency inspection terms that will be reported to the UN Security Council, the  IAEA said late Thursday.
The removal of the rods, if not halted immediately, could wreck the IAEA's  attempts to see if fuel had already been taken from the reactor, the IAEA said  in a strong statement.
