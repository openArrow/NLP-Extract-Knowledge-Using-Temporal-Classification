An armed gang killed three Russians and at least 11  Algerian soldiers in an attack on a bus near the Algerian coastal town of  Jijel, a Russian foreign ministry spokesman said Thursday.
"Most of the terrorists" were also killed in the attack on Wednesday,  spokesman Grigori Karassin said.
Neither government officials in Algiers nor diplomats in the Algerian  capital announced or confirmed the report.
The attack brings to 37 the number of foreigners reported slain in  Algeria, including seven Russians, in attacks blamed on armed Moslem  extremists who have been at war with the authorities since the beginning of  1992.
A Russian embassy official was shot dead on March 28 as he was shopping in  a village south of Algiers.
In October last year, two Russian air force instructors, lieutenant  colonels Vladimir Valejny and Alexander Orlov were killed at Laghouat in the  southeast by a gang who also seriously wounded one of their colleagues.
In December, a Russian woman married to an Algerian, Larissa Ayada, was  shot dead in an attack at a market in Diar El Afia, near Kouba in the southern  suburbs of Algiers.
The same month, an army bus used by Russian military cooperation personnel  came under fire near the capital and the driver was wounded, but there were no  Russians aboard at the time.
Moscow recalled "non-essential" diplomatic staff in December and  recommended that Russian nationals leave the country.
The unrest, which has in all claimed more than 3,000 lives, began when the  army intervened in January 1992 to bring about the cancellation of the second  round of a general election the Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win.
