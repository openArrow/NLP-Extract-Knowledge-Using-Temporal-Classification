French-based Haitian Ronald Agenor and 'lucky-loser'  David Prisonil of Germany wrote their names into the record books at the  French Open Tennis Championships here on Thursday when Agenor completed a 6-7  (4/7), 6-7 (2/7), 6-3, 6-4, 14-12 second-round victory in 5hrs 02mins.
The two players needed to complete 71 games to decide who plays defending  champion Sergi Bruguera for a place in the last sixteen.
That was seven games more than Spaniard Emilio Sanchez' 3-6, 5-7, 6-3,  6-4, 13-11 second-round win over Australian Wally Masur in 1992.
Agenor and Prisonil came on court on Wednesday and resumed their  unfinished clash Thursday at 9-9 in the final set.
They needed to stay on court for another 24 minutes to break another  record.
The longest-ever Championship match was set in 1984 when John Frawley beat  Schwaier of Germany 6-1, 4-6, 6-3, 6-7, 8-6 in 5hrs 25mins.
