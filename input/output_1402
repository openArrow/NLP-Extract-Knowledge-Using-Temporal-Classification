A UNHCR representative saw guerrillas open fire on refugees trying to  cross the Akagera river to seek sanctuary in Tanzania, UNHCR spokesman Rupert  Colville said in Geneva on Tuesday.
Kabia said a Ghanaian battalion which will be the first to return to  Rwanda as part of the new UN force would initially secure Kigali airport,  where fighting has often prevented relief flights from landing.
UN soldiers will then secure other areas of Kigali where thousands of  displaced people are sheltering before fanning out into other parts of the  country to help civilians who have fled their homes, Kabia said.
"We also hope to have a rapid deployment force that could go to areas  where there is trouble," he said.
"We need armoured personnel carriers and a squadron of helicopters to  airlift soldiers into the theatre immediately," he said. "Without that, we  won't succeed."
Small arms fighting continued as heavy rain lashed Kigali on Tuesday,  Kabia said.
