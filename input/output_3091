Nigerians were called to the polls Monday to vote  for delegates to a constitutional conference amid opposition boycott calls and  threats by pro-democracy groups to "physically" prevent the ballot.
The military government of General Sani Abacha, who seized power in  November, has declared Monday a public holiday in an attempt to encourage  voters to turn out en masse to choose delegates to electoral colleges in each  of Nigeria's 30 states and the federal capital territory, Abuja.
These in turn will select, in separate polls on May 28, a total of 273  delegates to attend the constitutional conference on June 27. The government  plans to make 96 additional appointments to the body.
But pro-democracy groups, including a powerful political group known as  Middle Belt Forum, have dismissed the vote as a "charade" aimed at   perpetrating military dictatorship in Nigeria.
They asked Abacha to invite, by May 31, the presumed winner of  presidential elections annulled last year, tycoon Moshood Abiola, to form a  government or face mass protests.
The Campaign for Democracy, a coalition of some 40 pro-democracy and human  rights group, has also warned that it would try and "physically" block the  vote.
The government, however, is going ahead with the poll and this weekend  managed to win support from a group of traditional rulers in the ethnic Yoruba  heartland in the southwest, Abiola's home region.
The Yoruba rules said they would back the government conference in June on  condition that the annullment of last year's presidential poll be on the  agenda, newspapers here reported Sunday.
The vote Monday is set to begin at 1100 GMT and end four hours later at  1500 GMT.
