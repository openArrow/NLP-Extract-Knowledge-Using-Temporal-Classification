Sicilian prosecutors demanded Saturday that  Senator Giulio Andreotti, the seven-time Christian Democrat prime minister, be  indicted on charges of collusion with organized crime.
The Palermo prosecutors office made its request to local judges after an  investigation launched in March 1992 into Andreotti's alleged links to the  Mafia.
Andreotti, 72, is a senator for life, but had his parliamentary immunity  lifted in June last year.
