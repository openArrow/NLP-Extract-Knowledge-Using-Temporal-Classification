Taiwan's top government watchdog Thursday approved  a proposal to censure the cabinet, defense ministry, the air force and its US  buying agency for irregularities in purchases of US S-2T anti-submarine plans,  officials said.
The defense committee of the Control Yuan decided that the bodies either  failed to supervise the deal or bought the planes at abnormally high prices,  and should be censured for administrative negligence, Yuan member Li Sheng-yi  said.
The Yuan will meet again to discuss censuring or impeaching the officials  involved, Li said.
The defense ministry has punished 23 senior military officers. Yeh  Chang-tung, former deputy chief of general staff and current president of the  Armed Forces University, was reprimanded for signing a contract with the US  plane maker Grumman for 20 overpriced S-2T aircrafts.
Lin Wen-li, former commander-in-chief of the air force, and 21 other  officials, including 10 lieutenant generals and eight major generals, were  given demerits for mishandling the case.
This was the first time in more than four decades that the Taiwan military  has taken disciplinary action against so many officers.
But Yuan members said they planned to impeach some officials who have been  spared by the defense ministry.
The case came to light when an opposition lawmaker, Chen Shui-bian,  claimed last July that he had evidence of irregularities in the  14-billion-Taiwan-dollar (518.5 million US) purchase.
Chen said the air force had originally planned to buy 32 S-2Ts at a cost  of 14 billion dollars, but later struck a deal with Grumman for 20 planes at  the same price.
He said he did not know why the air force had picked Grumman since  Lockheed, another US firm, had offered less expensive prices and technology  transfers.
Grumman had delayed delivery and failed to provide high-quality repair  services and spare parts, he added.
