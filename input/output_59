Foreign evacuees airlifted from Sanaa by  the British Royal Air Force Thursday said people were deserting the capital of  war-torn Yemen and shortages were worsening.
Two RAF Hercules transport planes airlifted 148 foreigners, most of them  British, to Cyprus from Sanaa. The evacuees, many looking exhausted, included  babies and young children.
They spent about two hours at Larnaca airport before boarding a British  Airways DC-10 plane bound for Gatwick airport, south of London.
Some had witnessed the fighting which erupted a week ago between northern  and southern forces and were in Sanaa when a Scud missile slammed into a  densely-populated area of the city Wednesday, causing at least 53 casualties.
Seventy-five evacuees arrived on one Hercules C-130 and 73 on the other.  The planes had flown into Sanaa from Djibouti earlier Thursday.
The group included about 20 Americans, as well as some Dutch, New  Zealanders, Swiss and Hungarians.
British construction worker Michael Wild said the blast from the Scud  missile which hit Sanaa Wednesday shattered windows in the hotel where he was  staying, 1,000 metres (yards) from the impact.
He quoted local Yemenis as saying 43 people were killed and 10 injured in  the attack, which flattened eight houses. Many of the victims were children.
The official news agency SABA said Wednesday 25 civilians were killed by  the Scud, fired by southern forces, and President Ali Abdallah Saleh put the  overall casualty toll at 53.
Wild added that the southern Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) building in the  capital had been devastated in a northern attack and the Italian embassy was  also hit.
A Hungarian neurosurgeon who asked to be not named said "medical supplies  are extremely low" at the main Al-Thawra public hospital in Sanaa, where he  had been working.
He said the operating theatres in the 500-bed hospital were barely  functioning and virtually all the hospital's foreign staff -- mostly  Bulgarians and Indians -- had left.
About 10 Jordanian doctors arrived at the hospital a few days ago.
The surgeon said some 15 Somali refugees caught in the crossfire were  admitted with serious bullet wounds, and "at least two of them died later."
The hospital was hit by electricity cuts and there was virtually no  maintenance, he said.
One of the Hercules pilots, Flight Lieutenant Nick Young, said  communications at Sanaa airport were "excellent" and praised the help offered  by the Yemeni authorities.
He said he saw no damage to the airport, despite reported bombing raids by  southern jets when the conflict erupted last week.
The evacuees were only allowed to bring out a maximum of 20 kilogrammes  (44 pounds) of luggage per person.
Yvonna Rienens, a Dutch teacher who was at an international school just  outside Sanaa, said 150 of the 200 teachers and pupils at the school had  already left.
She said she saw many Yemenis leaving Sanaa for villages outside the  capital, some with their goats, and carrying only a few personal belongings,  such as mattresses.
Oil engineers who were working for the US company Yemen Hunt Oil in the  Marib field east of Sanaa said about 200 oil workers had stayed behind to keep  operations at the field running. It produces up to 60,000 barrels of oil per  day.
Some of them said Sanaa appeared to be a "ghost town," with many shops  closed and long queues at petrol stations.
Veronica Pickton, a British tourist from Basingstoke in southern England,  said there were frequent electricity and water shortages at the hotel in Sanaa  where she had been staying for a week. However, there were "no signs of panic"  among local residents.
More than 4,000 foreigners have now fled the country since fighting  erupted.
Britain earlier organised an evacuation of 225 non-Britons from Sanaa.
Around 800 Britons, mostly oil workers, lived in Yemen before the civil  war started. Some who were based around Aden, the southern capital, have  already been evacuated by sea.
