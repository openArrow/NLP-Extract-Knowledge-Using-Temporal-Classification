Egypt is taking extra steps to purify drinking water  after thousands of corpses, victims of the Rwandan civil war, were found  floating in Lake Victoria, authorities said in reports on Sunday.
Twice as much chlorine will be used to make drinking water, even though  the risk of pollution was "extremely small" because the Nile River takes "45  days to reach Upper Egypt from Rwanda," Health Minister Ali Abdel Fattah said.
"Most of the disease-causing elements are likely to be killed during this  period," he said. "The sun, oxygen, and the force of the current contribute to  the river's self-purification."
Most of Egypt's drinking water is taken from the Nile which rises in Lake  Tanganyika 4,160 miles (6,695 kilomters) to the south between Zaire, Tanzania  and Burundi and travels through Lake Victoria, which straddles the borders of  Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania.
The World Health Organization said that nearly 50,000 bodies had been  found floating in Lake Victoria.
