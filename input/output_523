Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds  briefed President Bill Clinton here Saturday on Northern Ireland during a  private meeting said a White House official.
Earlier officials had insisted the two leaders would not get together but  later admitted they had talked for about 15 minutes.
Reynolds, who arrived in the United States on Friday, had not been  scheduled to meet any members of the US administration during his trip, which  is essentially concerned with trade, until he received the last-minute  invitation from Clinton.
On Friday the Irish government transmitted a document to London detailing  demands for clarification of the Anglo-Irish joint declaration from Sinn Fein,  the political wing of the outlawed Irish Republican Army.
Clinton told Reynolds that he hoped the latest developments would lead to  a solution.
"The president commended him for his good works and expressed the hope  that this will work to some resolution," said spokesman Mark Gearan.
Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams on Friday urged the British government to  respond positively to the clarification request, saying: "It is necessary that  the replies from London to our questions properly and honestly clarify these  issues so that the peace process can be advanced."
A statement issued by Northern Ireland Secretary Patrick Mayhew said the  British government would study and make public Sinn Fein's demands for  clarification.
Reynolds is due to fly back to Dublin on Sunday.
