South African diamond giant De Beers and the  Russian government have held talks on modifying their agreement on the sale of  Russia's diamonds, a joint statement said on Wednesday.
The talks were held in Moscow on Tuesday, the statement said, and were  aimed at "considering modifications to the existing marketing agreement ... in  response to the political and socio-economic changes that have taken place in  Russia."
The two parties signed a five-year agreement in 1990, in terms of which De  Beers, through its London-based Central Selling Organisation (CSO), would  market 95 percent of Russia's rough diamond production, the remaining five  percent to be sold by Russia on the open market.
The deal was secured with a one-billion dollar advance to Russia, most of  which has now been paid back in diamond shipments, a De Beers spokesman said.
"Further meetings on the subject will take place in the near future," the  statement said, but De Beers refused to discuss what changes to the contract  were under discussion.
"During the discussions, the parties reiterated their joint  responsibility, as the world's two largest diamond producers, to the  international diamond market and to the well-being of the world diamond  community," the statement said.
One analysts here said he believed that Russia was keen to retain more of  its production to sell on the open market as a method of raising hard  currency, while De Beers was keen to retain overall control of the diamond  market through the CSO.
