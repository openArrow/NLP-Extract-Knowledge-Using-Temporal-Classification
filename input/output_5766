Suspected Israelis on Tuesday shot dead two  Palestinians on the occupied West Bank just north of Jerusalem, witnesses said.
The two killers in civilian dress fled aboard a van bearing an Israeli  flag.
Uniformed Israeli troops followed up behind and carried off the two  corpses before ambulances arrived, the Palestinian witnesses said.
