Easy Goer, whose rivalry with Sunday  Silence defined the 1989 US racing season, died of natural causes Thursday at  Claiborne Farm.
The eight-year-old stallian was a son of Alydar. He won 14 of 20 starts,  with five seconds and one third, and was retired in 1990 after earning more  than 4,873,770 dollars.
Easy Goer was the champion 2-year-old of 1998. He won his first three  starts in 1989 and started as favorite at the Kentucky Derby, which he lost to  Sunday Silence.
He finished runner-up to Sunday Silence in the Preakness, but ruined  Sunday Silence's bid for the Triple Crown with an eight-length victory in the  Belmont.
