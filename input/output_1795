Defense Attorney Rafeal Perez Perdomo dismissed reports that Perez used  the funds to provide aid to Violeta Chamorro, who was elected president of  Nicaragua in 1990.
Interior Minister Ramon Escovar, who brought the initial charges against  Perez when he served as attorney general, said the Supreme Court's order  demonstrated that Venezuela was sincere about rooting out corruption.
"This is not an act of hostility or revenge, but a judicial move with all  the form and substance of the law," he said.
Perez, who survived two coup attempts in 1992, was the first Venezuelan  president to be impeached.
Figueredo was out of the country and believed to be in Britain. Arrest  warrants were issued for two other officials charged in the case, Carlos Vera  Aristigueta and Oscar Barreto.
