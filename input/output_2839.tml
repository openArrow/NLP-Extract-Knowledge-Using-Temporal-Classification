<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><TimeML><TIMEX3 tid="t0" functionInDocument="CREATION_TIME"/>As the Cannes filmfest <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">nears</EVENT> its climax  <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE">Monday</TIMEX3>, the race for the coveted Golden Palm is finally <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">narrowing</EVENT>, with  Poland's Krzysztof Kieslowski <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">emerging</EVENT> as the frontrunner for the top award.&#13;
But, with all save a few of the 23 competition films <EVENT eid="e4" class="I_STATE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">viewed</EVENT>, observers  <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">stress</EVENT> that no single film has proved outstanding, and that a surprise winner  cannot be <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="NEG" modality="can">ruled</EVENT> out.&#13;
"There really is nothing absolutely outstanding, in the league of 'Piano'  or "Concubine' <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DATE">last year</TIMEX3>," <EVENT eid="e7" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT> one critic, <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">referring</EVENT> to <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE">last year</TIMEX3>'s joint  Palm winners by New Zealander Jane Campion and China's Chen Kaige.&#13;
<EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">Leaing</EVENT> the field narrowly, <EVENT eid="e10" class="REPORTING" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">according</EVENT> to critics, is Kieslowski's "Three  Colours Red", the final part of his tricolour cinematic trilogy following  "Blue" and "White".&#13;
In a running poll in 'Moving Pictures' magazine, published here daily and  <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">putting</EVENT> together critical ratings from around the world, the film is the only  one to <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">score</EVENT> an average of eight out of 10.&#13;
The top prize for Kieslowski would <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="would">bring</EVENT> him an unprecedented triple win:  the previous parts of the trilogy have already <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">picked</EVENT> up the top prizes at the  Venice and Berlin film festivals.&#13;
The Golden Palm is to be <EVENT eid="e15" class="REPORTING" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">announced</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="TIME">Monday night</TIMEX3> at a ceremony here <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">hosted</EVENT>  by French actress Jeanne Moreau. The festival jury, <EVENT eid="e17" class="STATE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">presided</EVENT> by US actor Clint  Eastwood, <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">go</EVENT> into closed session to <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">vote</EVENT> on the issue <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="TIME">Monday morning</TIMEX3>.&#13;
But "Red" is not on its own. Of the films still in the running, Chinese  filmmaker Zhang Yimou's "To Live", has been widely <EVENT eid="e20" class="PERCEPTION" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">seen</EVENT> as the next strongest  contender, followed by Italian Nanni Moretti's "Dear Diary".&#13;
The two films <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">score</EVENT> 7.5 and 7 respectively in 'Moving Pictures'' poll of  critics.&#13;
Zhang's film, about three generations of a family <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">living</EVENT> through the  Cultural Revolution, has <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">caused</EVENT> a stir here not <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="NEG" modality="none">least</EVENT> because of the absence  of the director, who has <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">stayed</EVENT> in China to <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">protest</EVENT> censorship of his movie.&#13;
Another outsider for the top prize is Canadian Atom Egoyan's "Exotica", a  film of obsession which has <EVENT eid="e27" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">divided</EVENT> critics, but <EVENT eid="e28" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">attracted</EVENT> some strong <EVENT eid="e29" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">support</EVENT>  from some.&#13;
Late comers which could do well in the race for the Palm include US  filmmaker Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction", premiered <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX3>.&#13;
"There are a number of films which could easily be <EVENT eid="e30" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="could">pulled</EVENT> from the  envelope on <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="TIME">Monday night</TIMEX3>. 'Red' is certainly a strong film, but it is by no  means home and dry," <EVENT eid="e31" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT> one critic.&#13;
Of the other major prizes to be <EVENT eid="e32" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">decided</EVENT> <TIMEX3 tid="t8" type="DATE">Monday</TIMEX3>, firm predictions are as  hard to <EVENT eid="e33" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">come</EVENT> by as those for the top award.&#13;
For best actor, widely-tipped is Britain's Albert Finney, for his moving  portrayal of a failed classics master in Mike Figgis' "The Browning Version",  as has Jean-Louis Trintignant as the judge in "Red".&#13;
For best actress two strong contenders are Inna Churikova in "Riaba My  Chicken" and Kristin Scott-Thomas in the Romanian entry of the competition "An  Unforgettable Summer".&#13;
Jennifer Jason-Leigh, who <EVENT eid="e34" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">starred</EVENT> in both "The Hudsucker Proxy" by Joel  and Ethan Coen and "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle" by Alan Rudolph, has  also been <EVENT eid="e35" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">mentioned</EVENT>.&#13;
In <TIMEX3 tid="t9" type="DATE">last year</TIMEX3>'s awards, two films <EVENT eid="e36" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">dominated</EVENT> the festival. "The Piano" and  "Farewell to My Concubine" were widely <EVENT eid="e37" class="I_STATE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">expected</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e38" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">win</EVENT> the Palm virtually from  the start of the festival.&#13;
<TIMEX3 tid="t10" type="DATE">This year</TIMEX3> the competition has seemingly <EVENT eid="e39" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">returned</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e40" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">form</EVENT>. As one critic  <EVENT eid="e41" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT>: "There are some years when nothing <EVENT eid="e42" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">excels</EVENT>; we have <EVENT eid="e43" class="PERCEPTION" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">seen</EVENT> it before. <TIMEX3 tid="t11" type="DATE">Last  year</TIMEX3> was an exception.
