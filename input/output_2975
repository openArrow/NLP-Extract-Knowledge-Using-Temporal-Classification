Southern Yemeni leader Ali Salem al-Baid on  Sunday vowed that his forces will not surrender to northern troops trying to  capture his Aden stronghold.
"Southern forces refuse to surrender to the criminal gang that is using  all its might to destroy cities and lay siege to Aden," Baid said in a speech  marking the Al-Adha Moslem feast, broadcast by Aden Radio.
Baid on Saturday proclaimed an independant state in south Yemen, the  Yemeni Democratic Republic, with the port city of Aden as its capital.
The southern leader spoke from his native town Mukallah, in the Hadramaut  province, more than 500 kilometers (300 miles) to the east of Aden.
"We did everything to avoid this catastrophe, but we reject tyrany,  oppression and surrender. If they manage to break into some regions, they will  be considered occupiers," Baid said.
Yemeni Planning Minister Abdel Karim Al-Iriyani, a northerner, on Sunday  told the Qatari news agency that Saleh's troops were "at the gates of Ataq,"  the main town in the southern oil province of Shabwa, 130 kilometers (78  miles) east of Aden.
Baid's forces have since May 5 been locked in all-out war with troops  loyal to President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
