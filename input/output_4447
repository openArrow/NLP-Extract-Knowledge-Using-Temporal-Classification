Nancy Ramsbottom made good use of an  early tee time here Thursday, eagling the eighth hole en route to a one-shot  lead in the storm-disrupted first round of the Corning Classic women's golf  tournament.
Ramsbottom carded an eight-under-par 64, highlighted by the eagle at the  345-yard eighth.
"I wasn't really aiming at the pin because the wind was a little right to  left," she said. "So I pulled it a little bit. The wind helped it toward the  pin a little bit. I knew it was probably pretty close, but I didn't hear any  clapping or anything."
Ramsbottom's round was disrupted by the electrical storm, but she was home  and dry by late afternoon when the winds blew up again and the rain returned.
She used the delay to get in some shots at the practice tee, which she  said later helped her save par from the trees at the 16th.
"It was a big advantage being able to practice that shot," she said. "I  mean I hit a really good shot right at the pin. Going out and doing that kind  of kept my momentum going."
Pat Bradley and Amy Benz shared second on 65 and Beth Daniel was alone on  67.
Ramsbottom, who has not won in nearly 10 years, said the Corning Country  Club layout suited her short-hitting game.
"I like this course a lot," she said. "It's fun for me because there are  some par-fives I can hit in two."
