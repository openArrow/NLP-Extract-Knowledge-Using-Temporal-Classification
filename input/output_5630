North Korean troops on Monday removed their  equipment from the Military Armistice Commission (MAC) hall in the border  truce village of Panmunjom, South Korean Defence Ministry officials said  Tuesday.
The officials said the border guards stripped microphones and speakers  from their side of the hall, which has been used to supervise the truce  between the two Koreas since the MAC was signed after the devastating 1950-53  Korean War.
