Russian Evgeni Berzin snatched  the lead of the Tour of Italy here on Wednesday as teammate and former leader  Moreno Argentin was hit by disaster.
The 23-year-old Russian, whose win of this season's Liege-Bastogne-Liege  classic was set up by Argentin, escaped on the final Campitello Matese climb  to win the fourth stage.
Argentin, however, blew up with nine kilometres to go and lost around  three minutes.
Another prominent rider to see his victory hopes explode was Claudio  Chiappucci. The livewire Italian rider, who came second in this race in 1991  and 1992 and third last year, lost around five minutes.
Berzin, the 1990 amateur world pursuit champion who rides for the  all-conquering Italian team Gewiss, attacked five kilometres from the finish  and held off Italian Roberto Pelliccioli in a two-man sprint finish.
Another Italian, Vladimir Belli, came third, while pre-race favourite  Miguel Indurain of Spain finished in the peleton, 47secs behind Berzin.
Thursday's 158km fifth stage is between Campobasso and Melfi.
