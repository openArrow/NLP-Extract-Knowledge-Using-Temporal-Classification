Software giant Microsoft has developed a new  program aimed at helping future interactive television users, company  officials said.
The "Tiger" program was developed by the number one software company in  collaboration with computer makers IBM and Compaq, and is said to be less  expensive than other programs of its type.
IBM, Digital Equipment, Hewlett-Packard and Oracle have developed software  for interactive television that is currently used by British Telecom.
Interactive programs allow viewers to send signals to make purchases or  otherwise communicate with TV programmers.
Tiger, which can be used by personal computers and existing phone lines,  is to be tested next year in Seattle, Washington, and Denver, Colorado.
