President Bill Clinton is excited about his  trip to Europe beginning Wednesday, including a stop in Italy where his father  served during World War II, said White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers.
"He's excited. He's looking forward to it," said Myers, who added that  First Lady Hillary Clinton would travel to Europe while daughter Chelsea would  remain home.
In addition to meetings with new Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi  on Bosnia and trade issues, D-Day commemorations in Italy will have a special  significance for the president because his father was in Italy on June 6,  1944, when the Allies invaded Hitler's Europe.
Myers said family and army records were missing that would indicate  precisely where the president's father, William Blythe served. Blythe died in  a car crash before Clinton was born.
Also while in Italy, the president will meet with Pope John Paul II on  June 2. There has reportedly been friction between the Clinton administration  and the Vatican over abortion rights and Washington's support for more liberal  language in a UN plan for slowing world population growth.
Myers said that Senators Daniel Inouye, a Hawaii Democrat, and Robert  Dole, a Kansas Republican, would travel to Italy separately from the  president. Both are veterans of the Italian campaign, she said.
