Alberto Berasategui was too quick on the draw for  Yefgeny Kafelnikov in Saturday's French Open shootout between two of the young  guns of men's tennis.
The Spaniard, who upset Jim Courier to win the Nice Open last month, hit a   stream of winners from the baseline to notch up a 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 victory and  move into the last 16 of a grand slam tournament for the first time in his  career.
While Berasategui was firing from the hip, Kafelnikov, a finalist at  Hamburg and semi-finalist at Monaco this season, found his amunition was damp.
The Russian, who towered seven inches (18cm) over an opponent who at 5' 8"  (1m73cm) is one of the smallest on the tour, never managed to get his powerful  service working and Berasategui repeatedly pounced on his short second ball to  blast top-spin winners on both sides.
Kafelnikov was only briefly in the match in the first set when neither  player seemed able to hold their serve. But after five consecutive breaks,  Berasategui finally held for 5-3 then broke again to take the set and a  stranglehold on the match.
Berasategui is now lined up for a fourth round clash with the winner of  the match between Australian Mark Woodforde and Argentina's Javier Frana.
