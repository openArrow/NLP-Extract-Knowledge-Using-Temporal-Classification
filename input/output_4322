Russia has set no preconditions for joining  NATO's Partnership for Peace (PFP) programme but wants the alliance to respond  to a series of proposals for cooperation before signing up, Defence Minister  Pavel Grachev said Thursday.
He presented the proposals, notably on creating a mechanism for  consultation on security issues worldwide, and on increased military and  political cooperation, to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation Wednesday.
The statement, a copy of which was received by AFP Thursday, was headlined  the "practical participation" of Russia in the alliance programme.
It stated: "One of the goals of the partnership should be the formation of  a collective security and stability system in Europe."
It also also cited as an issue of "special importance" possible  cooperation over Russian-led peacekeeping operations in the former Soviet  Union.
A well-placed NATO source said Wednesday that Grachev had proposed levels  of participation proportional to Moscow's military weight, indicating an  enthusiasm exceeding all expectations.
"We thought (Russia) was only prepared to dabble its toe in the PFP, but  Grachev indicated it was ready to dive in," the NATO source said.
But Grachev also called for a formal system of consultations between  Moscow and NATO on European and world security.
He reiterated Russia's wish for regular and automatic meetings with NATO  at all political and military levels, something the alliance has thus far  resisted.
"NATO is not ready or willing to give any droit de regard (right to  influence) or even worse a veto over its activities," NATO deputy secretary  general Sergio Balanzino told a press conference Wednesday.
The Russian text added that the partnership should help coordinate  activities of NATO and other structures, notably the Conference on Security  and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council  (NACC), the document said.
The CSCE comprises all European countries plus the United States and  Canada, while the NACC is the NATO body responsible for consultation with  former Warsaw Pact countries.
"In principle, the CSCE and the NACC should seek to coordinate the efforts  of NATO," and other bodies including the European Union and the Commonwealth  of Independent States (CIS), the text said.
Political partnership would operate via consultations on European and  world security issues which would function "both on a regular and emergency  basis," it stated.
Balanzino, the chairman of Wednesday's meeting, suggested that NATO was  willing to accept the evolution of a "constructive and substantial dialogue"  if Russia embraced the military partnership.
But NATO rejected a treaty formalising bilateral relations with Russia,  although it did not rule out a less formal declaration when Moscow signs the  PFP.
