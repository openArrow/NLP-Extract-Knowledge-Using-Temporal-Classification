An Israeli reserve soldier was  apparently shot dead by friendly fire on the edge of the Gaza Strip, state  radio said Monday.
Military officials first announced that suspected Islamic fundamentalists  had gunned down 25-year-old sergeant Shlomo Shetrit who was on night patrol  Sunday with six other men.
He was hit in the head and died immediately.
After the radio report, an army spokesman said an autopsy and ballistics  investigation was underway to verify if friendly fire had killed the man.
The Israeli army had sealed off the area around the Nahal Oz crossing  point into centre of the Strip and launched a manhunt in the belief that  Palestinians had attacked the patrol.
A preliminary report on the shooting was also given to the new Palestinian  police force, which now controls most of the Strip apart from Jewish  settlements, the officials said.
But none of the armed Palestinian groups claimed responsibility for the  death.
The patrol was deployed to protect workers building a new border fence  around the Strip.
