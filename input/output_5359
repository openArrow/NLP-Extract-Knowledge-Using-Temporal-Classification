Football star Ruud Gullit walked  out on the Dutch World Cup squad and will not play in the tournament, Dutch  trainer Dick Advocaat announced here on Monday.
Advocaat said Gullit did not give any reasons for his departure but  promised to tell him after the tournament.
Gullit, who rejoined the squad from a self-imposed international exile  last week, played in Friday's win over Scotland but later criticised the Dutch  game plan.
Advocaat responded by saying he was in charge of the team and not Gullit.
The 31-year-old Gullit has won 64 international caps since 1981 and has  scored 17 goals.
He announced his retirement from international football in September 1992  and again in June last year but agreed to return in February, when it looked  as if Barcelona manager Johan Cruyff would take over from Advocaat for the  World Cup finals which begin in June.
Cruyff, however, fell out with the Dutch football federation and Advocaat,  who managed the side during the World Cup qualifiers, was asked to continue.
