The Irish Republican Army (IRA) announced Saturday  that it had executed a man near Armagh, southwest of Belfast, because he had  allegedly been spying on one of its militants.
Police said they located the body of a man in a field near Armagh but were  slowed down in collecting and identifying the corpse by fears that mines or  other booby-traps might have been planted nearby.
An IRA spokesman said in a telephone call to a Belfast news outlet that  the man was "arrested" and interrogated before being shot because "he was  observing movements of a republican."
The British army reported that one of its soldiers was missing Saturday  and sources said police assumed that this was the dead man.
The killing brought to 31 the number of people killed in sectarian  violence in Northern Ireland this year.
