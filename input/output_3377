Saudi authorities Monday confirmed  that pilgrims were killed in a stampede at the Moslem holy site here, but  failed to give an exact death toll.
Witnesses had earlier spoken of dozens of bodies littering the site.
A Saudi health ministry statement broadcast by state television said, "A  total of 829 people died during the pilgrimage season this year, as a result  of this afternoon's stampede and for other reasons such as heart attacks and  old age."
The pilgrimage officially began on May 20 but pilgrims began arriving  several weeks beforehand.
