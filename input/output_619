Nelson Mandela, South Africa's newly-installed  president, plans to step down after just two years in office after overseeing  the introduction of a new constitution, the Sunday Times newspaper said here.
Mandela has "privately hinted he will step down once a final constitution  has been written and he has overseen the country's first steps towards  reconciliation," the paper said, citing ANC insiders.
According to the paper "his determination to give up power well ahead of  the next general election has sparked a power struggle within the African  National Congress," which won a landslide victory in last month's historic  all-race poll.
Mandela, 75, was sworn in as president last Tuesday before an array of  world leaders, the pinancle of a political career which saw move from rural  poverty to lawyer activist, guerrilla commander and languish for 27 years in  jail before leading the ANC's successful election campaign.
