Japanese steel production appeared to have bottomed  out but steelmills might be forced to lower the prices of their products to  compete with cheaper imports, a top industry leader said on Monday.
Hiroshi Saito, chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel Federation, told a  news conference: "Suffice it to say that the steel output has bottomed out  quantitatively."
The output was estimated to total 24 million tonnes in the April-June  period, up from an earlier estimate of 23.2 million tonnes.
But he pointed out that the increase owed much to growing exports to the  United States, China and South Korea while domestic demand remained depressed.
"There has been no move in private investment in plants and equipment at  home," he said, ruling out a dramatic upturn in the domestic economy.
Saito, who is also chairman of Nippon Steel Corp., the world's biggest  steelmaker, said that some Japanese motor companies and shipyards were  considering buying cheaper imports.
He said steelmakers would not rush to cut prices but "we will be forced to  think about it if a big difference remains in the price gap."
