Boutros-Ghali
WASHINGTON, May 27 (AFP) - The United Nations is willing to wait a few  weeks to see if the international embargo against Haiti produces results, but  not several months, UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said Friday.
"Let us see what will be the result of the new sanctions," Boutros-Ghali  said after meeting with President Bill Clinton.
But he said "No, no, no, no. It is a question of weeks," when asked how  many months the United Nations was willing to wait.
A full international embargo against Haiti took effect last weekend in an  effort to force the military regime to step down and allow the return of  elected president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was ousted in September 1991.
Boutros-Ghali said he and Clinton did not discuss the possibility of a US  military intervention if the embargo did not work.
The next step would be decided by the UN Security Council, he added.
Boutros-Ghali said that the Dominican Republic's president elect Joaquin  Balaguer had pledged to help reinforce the boycott of Haiti.
There have numerous cases of oil crossing the Dominican Republic border  into Haiti in defiance of an international oil embargo imposed in October.
Boutros-Ghali said he had also discussed with the US president UN missions  to Rwanda, Somalia and Mozambique and the possibility of UN mediation in Yemen.
