Thieves crawled through a 500-meter (yard) long  storm drain and tunneled their way into a Thai bank over the weekend, making  off with nearly 100,000 US dollars in cash, news reports said Tuesday.
The storm drain connected with a 20-meter long, 22-centimeter (nine-inch)  wide sewer that led to a branch of the Thai Military Bank, the reports said.  After enlarging the sewer, the thieves then punched through the 15-centimeter  concrete floor of the bank here in the Thai capital.
Once inside the bank they forced their way into the vault.
Police found shovels, gloves, chisels, crowbars, a hammer, a circular  grinding stone, dead batteries, empty plastic bottles and bags of bread in the  tunnel, they said. Missing from the vault were 11 sacks containing 2,482,700  baht (99,300 dollars) and four small sacks of change.
The bank was unguarded over the weekend and had no security devices. It  previously was an auto parts store.
Police believe at least two people were involved in the robbery, one of  whom had inside knowledge of the bank, and estimate it may have taken them a  week to tunnel into the building, the reports said.
