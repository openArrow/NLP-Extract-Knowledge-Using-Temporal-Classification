US marines will began maneuvers in the  Caribbean aboard an amphibious marine vessel, but the exercise is unrelated to  the situation in Haiti, Pentagon officials said Tuesday.
Defense Department spokesman Dennis Boxx said 650 marines were involved in  the maneuvers of undetermined length on the assault ship Wasp, due to leave  its base in Norfolk, Virginia, on Tuesday.
The craft, which carries an undisclosed number of helicopters, was to make  stops at the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Puerto Rico.
Boxx said the maneuvers should not be interpreted as a precursor to a US  invasion of Haiti, which has been raised as a possibility by President Bill  Clinton and urged by some members of Congress to restore democratic rule.
