A strong earthquake rocked the southern Philippines  before dawn Saturday, toppling power and communication lines and houses,  authorities said, with at least three people reportedly injured by falling  debris.
The temblor, which struck at 4:12 a.m. (2012 GMT Friday), registered 5.7  on the Richter scale with its epicenter just a few kilometers (miles) off the  shore of Pagadian City, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology  (Phivolcs) said.
The quake, which resulted from tectonic plates colliding, also registered  a five on the Rossi-Forel scale in Pagadian, meaning that unstable objects  would be toppled but stable structures would not be damaged.
Pagadian police, contacted by telephone, said that when the quake hit,  residents of coastal areas panicked and fled to higher ground for fear of  tsunamis -- extremely high waves -- but have since returned to their homes  when it became apparent no tsunamis were coming.
Senior police officer Rodolfo Tual said the quake "was very strong but it  lasted just a few seconds," adding that it reminded him of a major earthquake  that caused tsunamis and killed several hundred people in the south in 1976.
Power and some communication lines in the city of 110,000 were knocked out  by the quake but electricity was restored after a few minutes.
Residents of Pagadian were quoted by southern Philippine radio stations as  saying that about 43 houses made of light materials collapsed, injuring three  people. Police said they were trying to confirm these reports.
The quake was felt throughout the western half of the large southern  island of Mindanao but had no significant effects outside of Pagadian,  Phivolcs said.
