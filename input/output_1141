Asian investors are being joined by western  counterparts in pouring billions of dollars into China's tourism industry, a  report said Tuesday.
In recent two years, foreigners have invested some 12.3 billion dollars in  81 hotel projects in China, with a total of 25,000 rooms, and another 50  billion Hong Kong dollars (6.4 billion US) in transportation, entertainment  and restaurant businesses, the China-backed Wen Wei Po reported.
The newspaper, quoting the China Tourism Administration, said tourism has  been a target for heavy foreign investment.
Most of the investors were from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore,  but in recent years they have been joined by Japan, the United States, Britain  and Canada in capitalizing on the booming tourism industry, the report said.
Last year, China received a record 41.5 million tourists -- up 8.9 percent  over 1992 -- with tourist receipts rising 18.3 percent to 4.67 billion US  dollars.
