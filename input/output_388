Ukraine agreed Friday to adhere to guidelines  for nonproliferation of missile technology, the White House said.
Vice President Al Gore and Deputy Prime Minister Valeri Shmarov signed a  memorandum of understanding on the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR),  which the United States and 24 other nations belong to, the White House said  in a statement.
"The memorandum is a welcome expression of the strong partnership that the  United States and Ukraine have established to address issues of  nonproliferation and arms control," the statement said.
"Ukraine's commitment to abide by the the criteria and standards of the  MTCR is an important step that shows the readiness to be a responsible  national actor in the sale of high-technology goods and services, including in  the aerospace sector."
The accord bans the export of missiles or missile technology to countries  that could use it to build such weapons.
