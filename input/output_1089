Former Bolivian dictator Luis Garcia Meza, 62,  denied murder and corruption charges during a hearing here Monday on whether  he should be extradited to Bolivia.
Garcia Meza, a former general who was convicted for murder, corruption and  abuse of authority in absentia in Bolivia in April 1993, was detained here on  March 11. He ruled Bolivia for 14 months from 1980-1981.
Accompanied by his lawyers and guarded by Brazilian police during the  one-hour session, a pale but straight-backed Garcia Meza told the judge that  he denied "ordering the crimes for which I was convicted."
Two of the Bolivians in the audience were Loyola Guzman and Beatriz de  Suarez Guzman, whose husbands were among the 22 opposition leaders beaten to  death on January 15, 1981.
Ladisael Bernardo, who is defending Garcia Meza, said the trial in Bolivia  and extradition request was political persecution and that the former dictator  could not be held responsible for the actions of his subordinates.
The judge hearing the case, Paul Brossard, 70, was an opposition leader  during Brazil's 1964-1985 dictatorship and was a member of the Chamber of  Deputies from 1981-1985 during Brazil's transition to democracy.
Hearings are expected to last 10 days and a decision is expected by July 1.
If returned to Bolivia, Garcia Meza faces a 30-year prison sentence.
