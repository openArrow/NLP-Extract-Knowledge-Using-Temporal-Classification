PLO leader Yasser Arafat will end his days as  mayor of the sleepy oasis town of Jericho if he makes one more call for a  "jihad" to liberate Jerusalem, an Israeli minister warned Friday.
There was an outcry in Israel after state radio on Tuesday broadcast a  speech made by Arafat in a Johannesburg mosque when he called on Moslems for a  "jihad," or holy war, to free Jerusalem.
"If he uses the word jihad once more, Yasser Arafat can sweat all summer  in Jericho, where it's hot day and night, and finish his political career as  mayor," said Environment Minister Yossi Sarid.
"If this happens the autonomy experiment will end in Jericho and the Gaza  Strip and go no further," said Sarid, a leader of the left-wing Meretz party  and supporter of a Palestinian state.
Israel and the PLO have still to negotiate the application of autonomy  through the remainder of the West Bank.
Arafat on Wednesday sought to play down the row, complaining that "jihad"  had taken on the connotation of a "holy war" waged by radicals, while it was a  religious term.
"We can say, 'I will continue my jihad to achieve peace' in an Islamic, in  a religious way. We can say 'I will continue my jihad to do my work well, till  I will be able to bring Christians, Moslems and Jews to pray together in    Jerusalem.'"
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who had warned the comment could jeopardise  the peace process, labelled Arafat's explanation as "evasive."
Arafat told the daily Yediot Aharanot on Thursday that he would settle in  Jericho in June, along with part of the PLO leadership.
