Hong Kong's electronic prowess has come up with  an enterprising way to cut the number of stray dogs -- all of man's best  friends in the territory could get microchip implants.
The government has started a trial to electronically tag the  160,000-strong canine population. It wants to cut the 18,000 dogs abandoned  each year and curb attacks on people, press reports said Sunday.
The microchip -- which bears information normally featured in a dog  licence, including the pet's age, address, breed, vaccination history and  details of its owner -- is injected into the animal's neck, veterinary  officials said.
Richard Rubira, the Agricultural and Fisheries Department vet resposible  for the programme, said the sheme was necessary as other tagging methods such  as collars and tattoos were open to abuse by owners.
He said most abandoned dogs rounded up by his department each year went  unclaimed by their owners and had to be put down. The new system, already used  in other countries, would allow pet owners to be traced and save the dog's  life.
The move to control the animals dogs comes after an eight-year-old girl  was savaged to death by two dogs here in January.
