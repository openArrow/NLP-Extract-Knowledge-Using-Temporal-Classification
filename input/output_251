Israeli soldiers shot three  people on Friday as black-hooded Islamic fundamentalists led a protest against  Palestinian self-rule by several thousand Gazans, a correspondent reported.
Clashes erupted with soldiers as about 5,000 anti-autonomy protesters  marched through Gaza City after a mass rally in a football stadium.
Three Palestinians were taken to hospital with bullet wounds.
Mohsen Abu Eitah, a member of the Islamic Resistance Movement (HAMAS),  told the rally: "Opposing the autonomy agreement does not mean we will act in  a destructive way against our people."
"We oppose the agreement because Gaza-Jericho was never our dream," said   Ahmad Bahr, a senior HAMAS figure. "We are afraid that Gaza-Jericho is not  first but last."
Under the autonomy agreement between the PLO and Israel, Gaza and Jericho  are granted autonomy for five years. After two years, negotiations are set to  begin on the rest of the occupied territories, including Jerusalem.
"We ended up with only 45 percent of Gaza," he said referring to the  presence of 4,000 Jewish settlers and troops to protect them.
"I hope our police will not be an Israeli puppet."
Hundreds of HAMAS activists donned black hoods with cut-out eyes for the  rally which was also called by Islamic Jihad and the Popular and Democratic  Fronts for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP and DFLP).
The groups demanded the release of all Palestinian prisoners.
