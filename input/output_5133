Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Sudanese  President Omar Hassan el-Beshir met in private at the residence of Austrian  President Thomas Klestil, a presidential spokesman said here Sunday.
During their head-to-head Saturday the two east African leaders discussed  the civil war in Sudan and bilateral relations, the Austrian spokesman said.
Since the outbreak of civil war in Sudan in 1983, some 300,000 Sudanese  have sought refuge in Uganda.
The Ugandan president started an official visit to Austria last Wednesday.  The arrival of the Sudanese president had been kept secret.
Beshir's Islamic fundamentalist government is fighting rebels from the  Sudanese People's Liberation Army, based in the mainly Christian and Animist  south of the country.
Peace negotiations between the government and opposition opened in Nairobi  on May 16 but adjourned to July 18.
