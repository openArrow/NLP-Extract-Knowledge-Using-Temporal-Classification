Indian army troops with orders to shoot rioters  on sight took up positions Saturday after a burst of ethnic violence left 22  people dead and hundreds injured in the far-eastern state of Assam.
The army joined police and paramilitary reinforcements in the riot-hit  district of Kokrajhar, where fighting between Bodo tribals and Assamese  natives broke out late Friday, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
Chief Minister Hiteswar Saikia told reporters in Guhawati, Assam's main  city, that the security forces had been armed with shoot-on-sight orders to  deter troublemakers.
The riots engulfed 10 villages in the Kokrajhar countryside as Bodos --  among whom a militant group is fighting for a tribal homeland to be carved out  of Assam -- went on the rampage setting non-Bodo homes on fire.
Officials said 22 people, mainly non-Bodos, were killed and hundreds  injured in the violence. But unofficial sources put the death toll at 30.
"Some of the villages were burning throughout the night and smoke is still  billowing out," PTI quoted official sources in Guhawati as saying. Five  hundred people were left homeless.
Most victims were reported to be non-tribal natives of Assam, an oil- and  mineral-rich state of 22 million bordering Bangladesh and hit by frequent  bouts of ethnic strife.
Saikia blamed factional fighting within the Bodo tribal movement for the  riots, saying opponents of Bodo leader Prem Singh Brahma provoked the attacks  against non-tribals.
The rioting was also linked to Bodo demands that non-tribal settlers leave  Bodo-dominated villages in Kokrajhar, where 50 people were killed in ethnic  violence last October, PTI said.
Saikia announced a compensation of 100,000 rupees (3,300 dollars) for  families of each of the dead. He ordered district authorities to set up relief  camps to shelter residents whose homes had been destroyed.
Assam is also the site of an insurgency led by Assamese extremists  fighting for secession from India.
