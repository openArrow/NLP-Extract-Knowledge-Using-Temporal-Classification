The dollar weakened in a calm market here early  Wednesday as traders were disappointed by the greenback's inability to climb  higher a day earlier after the Federal Reserve tightened US monetary policy.
Gold, meanwhile, fell to 379.50 dollars an ounce, down 1.90 dollar from  late Tuesday.
At about 9:30 a.m. (1330 GMT), the dollar traded at 1.6640 German marks,  down from 1.6655 several hours earlier in London and from 1.6720 late Tuesday  in New York.
Against the yen, it stood at 103.80, down from 103.85 in London and 104.55  in New York.
The US currency slipped against other major European currencies, falling  to 5.7000 French francs from 5.7340 late Tuesday, to 1.4150 Swiss francs  (1.4220) and to 0.6649 pound sterling (0.6658).
The stock and bond markets advanced Tuesday after the Fed raised two key  interest rates a half percentage point each.
But a trader with a European bank in New York said there was little  reaction by the dollar. "The dollar basically reached the same level as  yesterday morning," he said.
A selloff was expected at the 1.6750-mark level, the trader said,  predicting that it would not top 1.6725 marks during the day. At the low end,  he said, central banks could intervene at the 1.6620-mark level to support the  greenback.
Little movement was expected on the market in the absence of new US  economic reports, he added.
