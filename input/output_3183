A new poll released Monday found a majority of  Americans believe recent immigrants cause problems and one in five want to  send them all back home.
The poll by CBS television found that 53 percent of those surveyed believe  that immigrants cause problems compared to 29 percent who thought they  contributed to the country.
Only 16 percent said immigrants would make US society better, 41 percent  said they would make it worse, and 32 percent said they would have no effect.
Of those surveyed, 65 percent believed that tough economic times made it  hard to welcome immigrants with little money. CBS said a poll last June found  that only 60 percent felt that way, which was up 20 points from a 1986 poll.
However, only 34 percent believed it was time to halt all immigration. In  the view of 19 percent of those surveyed, America should always welcome  immigration while 43 percent said only some immigrants should be allowed in.
The poll found that 31 percent believe immigrants take jobs from  Americans, but 52 percent said they are the kind of jobs that Americans do not  want anyway.
