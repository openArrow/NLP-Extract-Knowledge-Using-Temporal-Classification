A missile fired by north Yemeni forces slammed into  Aden, the capital of southern Yemen, early Wednesday, triggering a huge fire  near the airport, correspondents reported.
South Yemeni anti-aircraft units had earlier opened fire in an attempt to  intercept the missile.
Ambulances and fire engines rushed to the scene but there were no  immediate reports of casualities.
Yemen erupted into open civil war between northern and southern forces on  May 5 as their political leaders had failed to agree on governing the country.
