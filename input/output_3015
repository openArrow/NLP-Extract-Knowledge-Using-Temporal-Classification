Australia's Geoff Brabham led a  dozen hopeful drivers battling the month's hottest weather in search of enough  speed to qualify for the Indianapolis 500.
Brabham turned a practice lap at the 2.5-mile (4km) oval above 221 mph  (353 km/h), making him the only racer to reach competitive qualifying speed  Sunday as the final hours of time trials ticked down.
"I think we can make the race," said Brabham, a 10-time Indy starter whose  top finish here was fourth in 1983. "Conditions are not what we want but the  car has run well enough."
Brabham is the son of Sir Jack Brabham, the three-time Formula One  champion who was the first modern driver to use a rear-engine car here.
The speed goal for Brabham and other racers was 220.737 mph (353.179 km/h).
That was the four-lap qualifying mark of Canada's Scott Goodyear, the  slowest qualified driver when the day began. Cars can only make the 33-car  field by qualifying faster and bumping the slowest car from the lineup.
Goodyear has a chance to make the race even if his car is bumped.  Secondary team driver Davy Jones qualified faster and might be replaced by  Goodyear in the car.
"If we were down to one car, I cannot commit to an immediate timetable to  finalizing our driver for the race," car owner Kenny Bernstein said.
