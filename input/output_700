New England boss Ray Illingworth warned England's  flops here on Sunday to start producing the goods -- or face the axe.
England's new chairman of selectors, after recalling Graham Gooch to the  fold, said: "The slate is clean and we start from here.
"But those people who have had a lot of opportunities won't get as many  chances as newcomers. They should start to produce in two or three matches if  they are going to."
Illingworth produced his broadside -- with Graeme Hick and Chris Lewis tow  of his likely targets -- while announcing a 13-strong squad for this week's  Texaco Trophy internationals against New Zealand.
He added: "We are going to want 100 percent commitment in concentration,  guts and determination. If we get that I think people will find I'm loyal in  return. If we don't, they won't play."
Former England skipper Gooch, who missed the winter tour to the West  Indies, was recalled after scoring a double hundred against Kent this week.
He got the nod after confirming he was ready to tour Australia next winter.
"You can't argue with his form," said the chairman. "Mike was quite happy  to have him in the squad and I should think he will bat at No 4."
Yorkshire fast bowler Darren Gough, 23, who toured with England A in the  winter, and Hampshire off-spinner Shaun Udal, 25, are both included in a  senior England squad for the first time.
Steve Rhodes, the wicketkeeper who played three Texaco matches in 1989 and  has been waiting for another opportunity ever since, is also included.
With Illingworth committed to playing a specialist behind the stumps in  all forms of cricket, Rhodes can put more heat on Jack Russell when he faces  the New Zealanders at Edgbaston on Thursday and at Lord's two days later.
But it's the likes of Hick, Lewis And DeFreitas who have most to gain --  or lose -- during the next few weeks.
