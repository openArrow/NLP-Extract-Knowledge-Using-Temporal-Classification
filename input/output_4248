Pakistani squash player Mir Zaman Gul, who  head-butted an opponent in this year's British Open, has been banned from next  year's event and fined 500 pounds.
The British Squash Rackets Association said on Thursday Gul's actions were  "wholly inappropriate for a squash player and have brought the game into  disrepute."
Gul had already been fined 1,500 pounds and suspended for four months by  his own association over the first round incident with Australian Anthony Hill.
