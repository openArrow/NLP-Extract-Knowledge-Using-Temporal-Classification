Johannes Rau is the candidate the man and woman in  the street would vote for if they could, according to the opinion polls.
Prime minister of Germany's most important and densely-populated state of  North Rhine-Westphalia since 1978, the avuncular Rau, aged 63, is popular in  the land at large as well as being well-liked within his Social Democrat Party  (SPD).
Rau says he would "reconcile rather than divide". But the present balance  of party votes in the presidential electoral system is against him, so he is  unlikely to have the chance to demonstrate such a capacity.
A veteran of the SPD, which he joined in 1957, he is one of its most  senior figures. At the last party congress, he won more votes than any other  to the party praesidum, of which he has been a member since 1968.
Rau unsuccessfully led the party in the 1987 federal legislative elections  as its candidate for chancellor.
Born January 16 1931 in Wuppertal, he is the son of a protestant pastor  and has earned the nickname of "Brother Johannes" for his knowledge of the  Bible and his inspired language.
Rau is also an acknowledged mediator of political and partisan strife.
To be elected Germany's head of state, with its moral rather than  political weight, would represent a crowning achievement in the career of  someone who has always sought to be "a man of the people".
