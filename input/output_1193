Fierce battles raged around a key air base  Tuesday as southern Yemeni forces, backed by warplanes, tried to prevent  northern forces from advancing on Aden, witnesses said.
The northerners, loyal to President Ali Abdallah Saleh, captured al-Anad  airbase on Monday, opening the way for a push toward Aden, 50 kilometers (30  miles) to the south.
"Fierce battles have raged around Al-Anad since the early morning," said  one of the witnesses.
The southerners, backed by warplanes were "trying to push back the  advance" of pro-Saleh forces on the southern stronghold of Aden, said the  witness.
He added however, that northern forces seemed better equipped and more  organized than their southern rivals.
The northern troops, backed by tanks, artillery and anti-aircraft  batteries, captured the base on Monday and cut off southern troops, an AFP  photographer said.
But the southerners later claimed to have recaptured the base, and the  intensity of Tuesday's fighting made it impossible to say who was in control.
Southern warplanes were bombing the newly-won northern positions, defying  anti-aircraft fire.
The two sides lurched into civil war on May 5, after months of arguing  over how to run the country, formed from the unification in May 1990 of  conservative North Yemen and poorer, Marxist South Yemen.
