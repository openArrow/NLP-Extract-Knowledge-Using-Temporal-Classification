A majority of Americans believe President Bill  Clinton's sex life has nothing to do with his ability to govern and say they  would vote for him even if they knew he cheated on his wife, according to a  poll published Tuesday.
Seventy-one percent of those surveyed said Clinton's marital fidelity was  between him and his wife Hillary and only 35 percent said they would be less  likely to vote for him if it was revealed that he had been unfaithful.
Twenty-seven percent of those surveyed in the Louis Harris and Associates  poll agreed that "American people should care," about the president's  extramarital relations.
The Harris firm conducted the poll of 1,253 adults on May 23-26 because  "these are the kinds of issues that have plagued Clinton even before he was  president, during the campaign, and this has come up again," said the  company's vice president David Krane.
Gennifer Flowers alleged during the 1992 campaign that she had had a  long-term affair with Clinton and Paula Jones recently filed a sexual  harassment suit against the president, who she said propositioned her while he  was governor in Arkansas.
The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
