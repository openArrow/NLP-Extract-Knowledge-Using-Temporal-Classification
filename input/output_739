Graf said: "It was difficult to respond to her serve in the first set, it  really was -- even her second serve. She hit them very hard.
"It's difficult because you don't really get into a rhythm. There's a fast  game and then the next game you serve and you suddenly have to play a few  rallies."
As for going into the French Open in eight days' time, the German  favourite said: "I've played better the last two matches. It was good to have  some tough matches before Paris, and so hopefully I'll be prepared."
Schultz said: "I believed in myself but it's hard. She puts so much  pressure on you all the time. But it's the best I've played against her so I  can't complain.
"All the first set I was relaxed and I really thought I had a chance in  the tie-break. I should have made the backhand over the net, but it wasn't an  easy point."
