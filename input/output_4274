Hong Kong gave a cold shoulder Thursday to  overseas Chinese dissidents bent on coming to the territory to promote the  overthrow of communist party rule in Beijing.
Chief Secretary Anson Chan, commenting on planned visits to Hong Kong by  Chinese dissidents living abroad, said it was "entirely natural" for Hong  Kongers to comment on events in China, which takes back the colony in 1997.
But she added: "The question of offering hospitality to visitors to Hong  Kong who might wish to use Hong Kong as a base for subversion is quite a  different matter.
"Neither the Hong Kong government nor the people of Hong Kong wish to see  Hong Kong being used as a base of subversion," said Chan, who is Governor  Chris Patten's second in command.
Wu'er Kaixi, one of the student leaders of the Tiananmen Square democracy  protests five years, has said he plans to visit Hong Kong shortly after the  June 4 anniversary of the Beijing massacre that snuffed the democracy movement.
He currently lives in San Francisco, having been spirited out of China --  along with several other outspoken dissidents -- via Hong Kong in the  aftermath of the crackdown.
