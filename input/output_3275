Scottish champions Rangers  transfer-listed international goalkeeper Andy Goram here on Monday after a row  with boss Walter Smith.
Smith is ready to let nine of his squad quit the club if the money offered  is right. Gary Stevens and Pieter Huistra are two other big names on offer.
Goram, 30, has won 29 international caps but has been badly hit by injury  this season, managing just ten outings.
He was out of action for nine months after undergoing a knee operation and  has had problems with thigh and back injuries since being taken off at  Tannadice on April 5.
Smith admitted there had been a row: "We had a disagreement over how he  should be training and handling his training. That led to the decision,  regretfully on our part, but it was the only way to relieve the situation we  were in."
Goram signed for Rangers from Hibs for 1 million in 1991 and they could be  willing to off-load him for half that sum.
