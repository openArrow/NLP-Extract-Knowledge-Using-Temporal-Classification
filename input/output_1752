An outbreak of measles has claimed more than 200  lives in Bauchi city, northern Nigeria, in the past two months, the official  news agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported here Wednesday.
It is difficult to know the exact spread and fatality rate of the disease  in the city because most people who contracted the disease no longer went to  hospital because of a drugs shortage, a medical officer in the city told NAN.
A medical worker in a private hospital in the town said that his hospital  recorded 18 deaths among measles patients in one week, including children aged  between two and seven.
