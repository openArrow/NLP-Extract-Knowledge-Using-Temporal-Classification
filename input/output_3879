The European Union released one million ECU (1.5  million dollars) for emergency aid to victims of Rwanda's bloodbath on  Wednesday, the EU announced in a statement.
The funds went to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to  enable it to pursue its medical and sanitation activities in the capital  Kigali and in the towns of Butare and Kibungu in the south and southeast.
Two Rwandan Red Cross workers were killed and five others badly wounded on  Wednesday in Kigali when a shell landed on their compound in the city as  rebels fought fierce artillery battles with the army.
But the ICRC said it had no plans to cut down on its staff or activities  there.
Wednesday's contribution brings to 2.63 million European Currency Units  (ECUs) the total amount of humanitarian aid given to Rwandans since the start  of the latest ethnic clashes at the beginning of April.
By some estimates, the wholesale slaughter has claimed half a million  lives in the central African nation, while another 500,000 have fled abroad  and many others are displaced inside the country.
