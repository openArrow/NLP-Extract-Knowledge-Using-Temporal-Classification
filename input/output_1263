By mid morning in London, the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares had fallen  0.3 points to 3,116.3. In Paris, the CAC-40 index showed a decline of 0.18  percent to 2,183.52 points.
At UBS, Roger Barker said that investors were "now expecting at least a  25-basis-point increase from the Fed", while "quite a few people are now  talking about a 50-basis-point increase."
Barker said that an increase of 25 points was likely to be "neutral" for  shares, while a 50-point increase or no action would be "moderately negative."
