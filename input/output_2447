Ajax Amsterdam have made a six million  dollar bid for Ronaldo Luiz Nazario de Lima, the 17-year-old who has been  included in Brazil's World Cup squad, Ceesar Masci, the president of Ronaldo's  club Cruzeiro said on Friday.
Masci said other European clubs, including Ajax's Dutch rivals PSV  Eindhoven and Barcelona, had expressed an interest in Ronaldo, the outstanding  prospect in Brazilian football. The club is waiting to see if the other clubs  come up with firm offers before deciding whether to accept Ajax's offer.
Ronaldo's inclusion in Carlos Parreira's squad has sparked comparisons  with the great Pele, who starred for Brazil in the 1958 World Cup as a  17-year-old.
