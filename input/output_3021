The president of the former South Yemen, Ali Nasir  Mohammad, rejected an offer to serve as vice president of a new breakaway  republic in the south, a Yemeni minister said here Sunday.
Justice Minister Abdallah Ghanim, a member of the Islamic al-Islah party,  told AFP that he spoke to the exiled former president who was in Damascus by  telephone Sunday.
Mohammad said southern leader Ali Salem al-Baid had contacted him Saturday  and asked him to serve for six months as vice president of the Yemeni  Democratic Republic declared in Aden, according to Ghanim.
Mohammad was to have succeeded Baid as president of the new republic after  the six months, but Mohammad rejected the offer, Ghanim said.
Ghanim quoted Mohammad as saying Baid's decision to set up a separate  republic as a "great crime against Yemeni unity." The former south and north  Yemen united exactly four years ago on May 22, 1990.
Mohammad, who could not be reached for comment Sunday, went into exile  after he was charged with trying to eliminate his political opponents in the  Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) in January 1986.
The move triggered bloody factional fighting in former south Yemen in  which at least 2,000 people were killed.
Mohammad fled to the former north Yemen. The government that followed in  Aden passed a death sentence on the former south Yemeni leader but Ali  Abdallah Saleh, who was president of north Yemen, refused to extradite him.
Mohammad later moved to Damascus.
The secretary general of the Sons of Yemen League opposition party, Abdel  Rahman al-Jiffri, was named vice president of the new republic, southern Aden  Radio said. There was no mention that Mohammad had been offered the job.
Forces loyal to Saleh, who became president of united Yemen, have been  fighting Baid's troops in a civil war which erupted on May 5.
