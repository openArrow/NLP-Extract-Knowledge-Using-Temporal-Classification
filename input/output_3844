The Bundesbank injected a net 7.5 billion marks  (4.5 billion dollars) into the banking circuit on Wednesday under a repurchase  arrangement for which the lowest rate fell by three basis points to 5.20  percent.
Economic analysts saw the reduction from the figure last week as a sign of  a slowing down in the German central bank's recent policy of regular interest  rate cuts.
Last week the lowest rate, or marginal rate, charged had been reduced by  12 basis points. The cut this week was the smallest cut in the rate since mid  April.
However analysts said that the process of gradually falling interest rates  had not come to an end yet.
Burkhard Erke of Schroeder Muenchmeyer saw that the discount rate might  fall to four percent by the end of the year.
Peter Pietsch of the Commerzbank noted that the present high rate of  growth in M3 money supply, attributed by the Bundesbank to "exceptional  factors", had not prevented the bank from making rate cuts based on a  "favourable outlook on the inflation front".
Since the beginning of March the marginal repo rate, effectively the  Bundesbank's third base rate after the discount and Lombard rates, has come  down by 0.80 percentage points.
Since mid-February the discount and Lombard rates have come down by 0.75  percentage points and now stand at 4.50 and 6.0 percent respectively.
The central bank awarded commercial banks tenders totalling 63.7 billion  marks under this week's variable rate 14-day securities repurchase  arrangement, in replacement of an expiring facility of 56.2 billion marks.
The new arrangement was awarded mainly at rates of 5.21-5.22 percent,  against 5.24-5.25 percent the previous Wednesday, with one tenth of the  tenders being awarded at 5.20 percent, the lowest rate accepted.
Commercial banks had requested funds totalling 96 billion marks.
