Nepal said Tuesday it was negotiating the  release of a Nepalese peacekeeper kidnapped in Somalia and identified five of  its soldiers killed by rebels in the war-torn country.
The five Nepalese peacekeeping volunteers were shot Monday while trying to  negotiate the return of a United Nations vehicle stolen by rebels near  Mogadishu's airport, according to the defence ministry.
Another Nepalese soldier, Lance Corporal Kumar Bania, was kidnapped Monday  by Somali rebels while undergoing medical treatment at a hospital in  Mogadishu, it said.
Bania was shot in the head by an unidentified gunman while on escort duty  May 13, the ministry said.
A defence ministry source said negotiations were under way between the  rebels and representatives of the Red Cross to obtain Bania's release.
The dead soldiers were identified as Major Shiva Bahadur Pun, technical  Sergeant Pritam Raj Shimkhada, Corporal Laxoan Tamang, and infantry-men Ram  Bahadur Gurung and Nawaraj Dhakal.
"Major Pun and technical Sergeant Shimkhada died from bullet injuries on  the way to the hospital while the other three died on the spot," the ministry  said.
A total of seven Nepalese peacekeepers have been killed near Mogadishu, a  ministry spokesman said.
