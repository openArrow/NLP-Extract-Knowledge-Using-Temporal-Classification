Two Saudis convicted of rape and a Pakistani  drug-smuggler were beheaded by sword Friday in Saudi Arabia, the interior  ministry said in a statement broadcast on television.
Saudis Saleh Selimi and Kasseb Zahrani were sentenced to death for raping  a woman at knife point after breaking into her house. They were beheaded in  Jeddah, on the western coast.
Pakistani Hakam Khan Said Ismail Khan, who had attempted to smuggle heroin  into the kingdom, was executed in the capital Riyadh.
Twelve people have now been beheaded in Saudia Arabia this year, according  to figures compiled from interior ministry statements.
Saudi Arabia decided in 1987 to sentence to death drug traffickers,  pushers and persistent users in a bid to stop drug abuse.
Beheadings are usually performed publicly, after the weekly collective  prayer on Fridays.
