Los Angeles police stayed home from work  Tuesday by the hundreds to press their demands in contract talks, and  threatened to leave World Cup crowds to fend for themselves.
"Those plans are being developed as we speak. The World Cup is going to be  the target," said police union vice president Ron Aguilar.
About 7,600 police here have worked with no contract for two years.
Monday, 226 of the 494 uniformed officers due to work the evening shift  phoned in sick.
Day shift staff were kept at work on overtime to fill the gap, which could  cost as much as one million dollars daily, according to city estimates.
While Aguilar said he did not expect a full strike would be called, he  said another organized call to stay home would hit the shift that runs from  Tuesday night to Wednesday morning.
Earlier this month officers rejected a contract that their union leaders  approved with a three percent pay hike in July and another three percent rise  in September 1995. They earn an average 33,157 dollars annually.
World Cup matches in cluding the final are to be played in nearby Pasadena  from June 17 to July 17, and are expected to draw 200,000 visitors.
