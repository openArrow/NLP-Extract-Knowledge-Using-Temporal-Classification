Secretary of State Warren Christopher is close  to finishing his analysis of human rights in China, but he is not indicating  how he will decide on China's trading rights, a spokesman said Monday.
Christopher must advise President Bill Clinton on the rights situation  before June 3, the deadline for Clinton to decide whether or not to extend  most favored nation (MFN) trading privileges to China.
The United States is attempting to pressure China into making human rights  improvements by threatening to withhold MFN rights, which bring the lowest  available US tariffs on imports.
A coalition of human rights groups said Monday that China had failed to  meet criteria set by Clinton a year ago and that conditions had actually  become worse in China.
Business interests, fearing a potentially huge drop in trade, are urging  MFN be granted with no strings attached.
Those backing MFN for China include Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy who  said, "China represents a very important market for the United States  agriculture commodities, an important market that will be increasingly  important in the next decade."
"We need to be very clear that if somehow we would rescind MFN to China,  that other nations against whom we compete would just come in and fill the  vacuum," Espy said.
