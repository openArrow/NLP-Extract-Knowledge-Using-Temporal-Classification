Israel on Tuesday dropped its demand that PLO  leader Yasser Arafat give a written commitment to respect the Palestinian  autonomy acccord, an official said.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin had called for the pledge after Israeli radio  played an extract from an Arafat speech in which he suggested he the agreement  was merely a ploy and could be broken.
But an official at the prime minister's office, who requested anonymity,  said Tuesday that Rabin "expects Arafat to give a public commitment to respect  the terms of the autonomy accord."
"It doesn't matter to Mr. Rabin if this commitment is written or verbal,  the important thing is that he shows his willingess to stick to the  agreement," the official said.
