A young gray whale who entered the  San Francisco Bay waterways over the weekend and defied attempts to herd it  back to sea, died at the bottom of a muddy creek late Monday, volunteers said.
"It was deep enough water for it to swim, then it dove and it didn't come  up again," said Denize Springer, a spokeswoman for the Marine Mammal Center.
The 8.0-meter (26-foot) gray whale twice appeared to be heading back to  sea but changed direction and got stuck in shallow, muddy waters until high  tide.
The second time, early Monday, volunteers using a harness hooked to rubber  rafts helped the whale break loose only to see it stuck again a little later.
A plan to hoist the whale onto a flatbed truck and drive it back to the  sea was discarded as experts deemed it too traumatic for the already weakened  mammal.
