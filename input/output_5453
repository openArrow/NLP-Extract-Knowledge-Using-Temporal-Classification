The stamina-sapping red clay surfaces at the Roland  Garros Stadium began to take their toll as the French Open Tennis  Championships moved into their second week here on Monday.
Javier Frana pulled up in agony and had to drop out of his fourth-round  clash against Spain's Alberto Berasategui after two sets with a stomach muscle  injury.
Jaime Yzaga of Peru, beaten in straight-sets by Sweden's Magnus Larsson,  looked a pale shadow of the player who had put out 1989 champion Michael Chang  after a four-and-a-half hour classic in the previous round.
And Aaron Krickstein, who had sent Michael Stich packing before the first  weekend, failed to win a set against the German's 'unknown' compatriot Hendrik  Dreekmann.
Frana, 27, beaten in the first-round on both of his previous visits, had  reached the last-sixteen after edging past Australian Mark Woodforde after a  marathon five sets and 53 games.
But he had no answer to Berasategui's wristy groundstrokes and when he  called it a day he was trailing badly at 2-6, 0-6.
It was the second time at the Championships that the promising 20-year-old  Spaniard has not had to go the distance. In the first-round South African  Wayne Ferreira withdrew with gastric 'flu after just one round.
Berasategui now plays either big-serving fifth-seeded Goran Ivanisevic or  Italy's Andrea Gaudenzi.
