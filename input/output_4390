Chuck Daly, who coached the US  Dream Team at the Barcelona Olympics, resigned Thursday as coach of the New  Jersey Nets National Basketball Association team.
Daly had one year left on his three-year, four-million-dollar coaching  contract, and said he would stay with the club for two more years working in  another capacity.
"The bottom line is that after 1,475 games at every level, I finally made  the decision that it is time to leave the bench," Daly said. "This was not  easy. It was a very agonizing decision that I had been thinking about the last  few years."
Daly, who led the Detroit Pistons to two NBA titles in 1989 and 1990, had  one of his best coaching seasons as he led New Jersey to a 45-37 record  despite the death in the off-season of star shooting guard Drazen Petrovic.
Daly said his decision was not based on the Nets' failure to get past the  New York Knicks in the first round of the NBA playoffs this season.
