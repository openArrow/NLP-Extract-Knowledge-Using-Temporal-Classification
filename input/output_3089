Northern Yemeni forces said they were in control  Monday of a strategic military base in the southern oil province of Shabwa,  but the claim was hotly denied by their rivals.
A military spokesman in Sanaa said that the military base at Ateq, capital  of Shabwa, had fallen to government troops.
"All of the base's facilities are in the hands of the legal (northern)  forces," the spokesman said.
The northern forces loyal to President Ali Abdallah Saleh also said they  had been in control of another southern military base at Al-Anad since Friday  and had now surrounded the southern stronghold of Aden.
Ateq lies 130 kilometers (78 miles) east of Aden.
However, a southern military spokesman described as "unfounded" claims  that Ateq had fallen or that the northerners were in control of Shabwa  province.
The denial was broadcast on television in Aden, capital of the breakaway  state headed by southern leader Ali Salem al-Baid.
Saleh has vowed to crush the southern secession and said his troops were  heading for the port of Mukalla 500 kilometers (300 miles) northeast of Aden,  where Baid has set up base.
The northern forces are trying to capture Aden, but denied it had fired a  missile at the city on Sunday. The south said four people were killed and nine  wounded Sunday in a missile attack.
Baid was named president Sunday of the breakaway Yemeni Democratic  Republic which he proclaimed at the weekend.
