The United Nations suspended its operations in  conflict-torn Rwanda on Tuesday after a Senegalese UN officer was killed by a  shell in the capital, deputy UN force commander Brigadier Henry Anyidoho said.
"I have ordered that we suspend all operations immediately until the  situation stabilises," the Ghanaian general said, after the officer was killed  by shrapnel from a shell that landed close to his car in central Kigali.
Capatain Mbaye Diagne was killed near a checkpoint manned by government  forces by a shell believed to have been fired by the rebel Rwandan Patriotic  Front (RPF), Anyidoho said.
His body was taken to Kigali airport.
"From the information I have received from the scene, the shell came from  the RPF side," Anyidoho said.
The driver's seat in the car was covered in blood, an AFP reporter on the  scene of the attack said.
