Sporadic bursts of heavy weapons continued in the  Rwandan capital Saturday as rebels fighters battled government troops in an  attempt to take control of the city, United Nations sources said.
Saturday's fighting mainly involved larger weapons fired from long  distances, unlike the close range small arms duels that raged in Kigali on  Friday.
Most of the fighting, pitting the mainly Tutsi Rwanda Patriotic Front  (RPF) against Hutu-dominated government troops, was taking place in areas  surrounding the headquarters of the United Nations Assistance Mission in  Rwanda (UNAMIR) and the road leading to the airport.
The rebels claimed on Friday that they have taken control half the country  after five weeks of heavy fighting with government forces during which tens of  thousands of people have died.
The tiny central Africa nation plunged back into a murderous ethnic war  after Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in an alleged rocked  attack on his plane on April 6.
The UN Security Council on Friday delayed a vote on a plan to deploy 5,500  peacekeepers to Rwanda to reinforce some 400 troops now there. A decision is  expected next week.
