Russia's organized crime gangs are making  systematic attempts to gain control of the country's stock of 15,000 tactical  nuclear warheads, a magazine report said Sunday.
In an article in the June edition of The Atlantic Monthly released Sunday,  veteran political commentator Seymour Hersch said there is "powerful evidence  that organized crime in the former Soviet Union has been systematically  seeking access to the nuclear stockpiles with their potential for huge profit."
Citing unnamed government sources, Hersh added that security problems  surrounding the stockpiles were now causing the administration of President  Bill Clinton "a lot of legitimate and deep concern."
Separately, the magazine also charged that the government of the then  president, George Bush, passed on intelligence information to Boris Yeltsin at  the time of the failed August 1991 coup attempt against Mikhail Gorbachev.
A US communications specialist was dispatched to Yeltsin's parliamentary  office to enable the current Russian head of state to place untraceable calls  to a number of military commands to persuade them not to join the coup  plotters, the sources said.
Another US official responsible for monitoring communications within the  Russian defence apparatus was ordered by the White House to inform Yeltsin  that the armed forces had not responded to the coup call, the magazine said.
This information helped Yeltsin, then president of the Russian Federation,  emerge from the crisis with his reputation considerably enhanced.
Previous US reports on the crisis had indicated that Bush had warned  Gorbachev in June 1991 that a coup was imminent, but made no mention of any  intervention on Yeltsin's behalf.
