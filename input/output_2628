The tall Canadian-born French hope has enormous talent but lots of  off-court problems. Her controversial father, Jim, had to be expelled from the  Stadium   last year and banned from other venues because of his rowdy  behaviour. Providing she can blot out the family traumas, the 19-year-old can  be devastating and she is capable of outhitting most opponents on both the  backhand and the forehand from the baseline. She will be making her fifth  appearance at Roland Garros. Last year she was beaten by fellow teenage star  Jennifer Capriati who has been out of tennis since last September and who was  recently arested on a drugs charge. Pierce has a tough opening match against  Nicole Provis of Australia -- a former semi-finalist.
Strengths: Service and Power
Weaknesses: Tends to get trapped into errors in long rallies
KIMIKO DATE (Japan x6)
The 23-year-old player has earned 'super-star' status back home in Japan  after a spectacular climb up the rankings and into the 'top-ten'. Date, who  was born in Kyoto, prefers faster surfaces and has not had a good draw. She  plays the excellent South African Amanda Coetzer in the first round.
Strengths: Forehand
Weaknesses: Lacks stamina
MARY JOE FERNANDEZ (USA x10)
Last year's finalist, who took Graf through three tough sets, relies on  her baseline accuracy and sizzling passing-shots to tame opponents. The  22-year-old, who is still looking for a first 'Grand Slam' win, has also  reached two Australian Open finals.
Strengths: Patience and fighting spirit
Weaknesses: Lacks stamina and is too predictable
