Pena Gomez's Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) called for new voting to  be held in 40 percent of the districts, where cheating was alleged to have  occurred.
"He is determined not to let our victory be hijacked," PRD spokesman  Rafael Taveras said of Pena Gomez. "We are going to undertake all the actions  necessary, by civic means, to stop this scandalous fraud."
Meanwhile former US lawmaker Stephen Solarz, who heads a team of  international election monitors, cited widespread irregularities in the vote  that he said may have altered the outcome.
Solarz said large numbers of people in predominantly opposition areas were  unable to vote, suggesting a possible deliberate effort to manipulate the  results.
Luis Ayala, president of the Socialist International for Latin America,  said there were "serious and grave irregularities that have affected the  conduct of truly free, fair and informed elections."
It was not clear how long the election board would have to act on Pena  Gomez' challenge, which was formally filed Wednesday.
Election board spokesman Francisco Alvarez said the board would meet late  Wednesday but provided no further details.
The five-member election board includes three members affiliate with the  government, according to opposition leaders.
After a day of high tension, fed by fears of a violent opposition  backlash, the capital slowly began returning to normal Wednesday.
Troops armed with assault rifles and police, who were out in force  Tuesday, guarded government buildings and the headquarters of the election  board Wednesday but in smaller numbers.
So far the election has proceeded without violence, but at least 30 people  were killed in partisan clashes during the campaign in the Dominican Republic,  which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti.
