Zimbabwe's Mark McNulty clung on to the lead in the  Spanish Open here in stormy conditions after surviving a 36-hole endurance  test and a two-pronged attack from Colin Montgomeries and Mark Roe.
The 40-year-old McNulty, finishing off a morning 69 to lead after a  weather-interupted second round, then added a 70 to get to 207, while European  number one Montgomerie shot a best-of-the-week 66.
Roe, meanwhile, produced a 69 after springing into contention for the  83,000-pound title by scoring seven birdies in a morning 68.
But McNulty's steadiness under pressure and his smooth putting stroke  proved invaluable.
"It had been a very long two days and I shall be going straight to bed,"  he said. "I will be looking forward to the last round and I have a strong will  to win."
Scot Montgomerie used his third new putter in as many rounds, having  brought five with him to Spain in the hope of finding a cure to his inability  to sink anything longer than four feet.
The latest worked so well that he made five birdies in an outward 31 which  included a chip-in from ten yards at the ninth.
Langer, twcie a Spanish champion, played faultlesss golf in his evening 69  to be the dangerman at eight under, alongside England's Richard Boxall.
But Jose Maria Olazabal, the new US Masters champion, is not out of the  hunt. He sank a 30-foot putt at the last for a 69 to take seventh spot on a  six under 210.
The second round was completed 21 hours behind schedule after the second  half of the field got round on Saturday morning without undue difficulty.
