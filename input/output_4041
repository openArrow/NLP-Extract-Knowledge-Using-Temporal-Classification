The prime minister and opposition leader in Lesotho  met here on Wednesday to defuse a law and order crisis caused by a 17-day-old  strike by police.
Representatives of the striking policemen also attended the meeting.
Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle told reporters after the two-hour meeting  that he had invited comments and suggestions from all political parties "to  help the situation return to normal".
He said the leader of the opposition Basotholand National Party (BNP)  Everistus Sekhonyana had promised to help where he could but had also asked  for a full appraisal of the situation regarding the strike.
A government source said he was confident a solution would be found soon.
Businesspeople fear the fragile Lesotho economy will be damaged if the  strike continues because gangs of youths taking advantage of the lack of  policemen have begun looting businesses and stores.
The British High Commission has advised people to exercise "extreme  caution" in moving around Maseru.
Mokhehle has rejected the police demands for a 60 percent pay hike, saying  the country cannot afford it.
About 2,500 policemen out of the total force of 3,000 went on strike on  May 9 and were later joined by junior prison guards.
Mokhehle's Basotholand Congress Party ousted the BNP from power in March  last year in the country's first democratic elections in 20 years.
The police strike is the latest crisis to hit Lesotho's increasingly  embattled government, which saw rival army factions fight across Maseru in  January and the killing of the deputy prime minister in a brief army uprising  in April.
