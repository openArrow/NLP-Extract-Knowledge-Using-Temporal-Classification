An earthquake measuring 6.1 on the open-ended  Richter scale rocked the popular Greek holiday island of Crete Monday sending  thousands of panic-stricken people into the streets and closing businesses and  schools.
Local authorities said the quake did not claim any victims but buildings  were damaged and cracks could be seen in homes on the northern part of the  island.
The epicenter of the quake was located 300 kilometres (180 miles) south of  Athens, off the northern coast of Crete, close to the towns of Rethymon and  Heraklion.
Police in Canea, on the northwest of the island, said the roofs of two  schools and the minaret of the town mosque had been damaged.
Crete is situated on an active faultline that runs from southern Albania  to southern Greece, passing through the Ionian Sea and west of the Peloponnese.
Greek seismologists said that because of the depth of the epicentre,  situated 80 kilometres below water level, immediate aftershocks are unlikely.  New quakes in the Sea of Crete are not ruled out, they said.
Athens university professor of seismology Yannis Drakopoulos advised  Cretians living in damaged or dilapidated buildings to avoid sleeping at home  for the next few days.
