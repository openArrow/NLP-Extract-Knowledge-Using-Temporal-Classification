Media magnate Rupert Murdoch is embarking on  another buying spree of US television stations, setting his sights on 15 more  within a year, according to The Weekend Australian which he publishes here.
The News Corp. Ltd chief told the paper he would also like to buy  Australia's Seven Network if Canberra deregulated laws preventing cross-media  ownership in his native Australia.
"We're a large shareholder in Seven and we'd be very happy to increase  that 15 percent if it were legally possible," he said.
Murdoch, a former part-owner of Ten Network, is prevented from owning  Australian television stations because of cross ownership legislation  forbidding domination of both television and newspaper markets.
His compay dominates the Australian newspaper industry.
Murdoch's Fox Broadcasting last week bought 12 US television affiliates at  a cost of 700 million.
"We don't want to get over-borrowed again but we have a two (US) billion  dollar bank facility available for acquisitions or extra working capital as we  make more films or whatever," he said.
"If we were to be making any really major acquisitions we would certainly  be looking at raising some money."
