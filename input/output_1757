About one third of Russia's 150 airports were hit  by strike action Wednesday as 62,500 of the country's pilots, or 80 percent  protested at plunging safety standards and poor retirement benefits, their  union said.
The transport ministry's press office called the strike illegal and said  the prosecutor's office had begun legal proceedings against the union. A  ministry spokesman noted the government recently adopted a resolution  depriving public transport companies of the right to strike.
"We will continue the strike until our demands have been met," ITAR-TASS  quoted Vladimir Sergeyev, vice president of the pilots' union, as saying.
Among airports affected were Saint Petersburg as well as several airports  in Siberia and southern Russia.
The Moscow airports of Domodyedovo and Bykovo, which handle domestic  flights and flights to countries within the Commonwealth of Independent  States, were also affected.
Boris Medvedenko, a union leader, said pilots at the capital's two  privately-run airports, Sheremetyevo 1 and 2, which handle international  flights did not follow the strike call.
A ministry of transport spokesman said only 38 of 1,200 scheduled flights  were delayed.
But Anatoly Kochur, president of the Russian pilots' association, retorted  that "the Russian constitution (which grants workers the unlimited right to  strike) is the only text which is valid."
The pilots' union had previously threatened industrial action on several  occasions, but said this time the seriousness of the situation warranted  carrying out the threat. The unions wanted a "written guarantee" from Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin that their pensions would be increased, Kochur  added.
