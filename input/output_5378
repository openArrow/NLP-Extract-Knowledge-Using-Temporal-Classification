"I wanted to play against South Africa, but now I'm out for three weeks.  I've had concussion before -- in 1992 -- and am very despondent."
Johnson's replacement, 21-year-old Bristol lock Simon Shaw, was due to  arrive here later Monday.
The injury came late in the second half with Johnson left on the ground at  the end of a spell of hard forward encounters.
Johnson was unable to shed light on allegations that he had been laid out  by a punch from a Transvaal player. "I really can't remember too much about  the game," he said.
England manager Jack Rowell said that none of the tourists had made any  mention of foul play by Transvaal players.
