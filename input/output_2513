The pay dispute between Los  Angeles police and city officials has threatened to spill over into the World  Cup, with officers threatening to withdraw their services during the event.
Members of the main police officers' union threatened Thursday to take  sick leave during the event from June 17-July 17.
The World Cup final is to be played July 17 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena,  a suburb of Los Angeles.
The Rose Bowl is the sight of seven other matches -- four Group A first  round matches, one second round match, one semi-final and the match for third  place on July 16.
Union official Cliff Ruff called for the "sick-out" after 75 percent of  union members rejected the city's latest offer in pay negotiations -- a raise  of three percent in July followed by another three percent in September of  1995.
"We have been without a collective bargaining agreement for two years, and  now they are offering us crumbs," said police sergeant Frank Mena.
"I consider their offer an insult," said another officer, Pete Llanes.
If police do take action during the World Cup, calling in sick or refusing  to work overtime, California Governor Pete Wilson may be forced to use the  National Guard to ensure security.
