But coach Alfio Basile knows Maradona's mere presence on the pitch could  well lift his teammates once more to the ultimate goal.
As it is, one of his teammates, 27-year-old Claudio Caniggia, who like  Maradona has been beset by problems off the field, is neither as quick nor as  fit as he was.
Yet only about a quarter of Argentina's expected squad of 22 are likely to  be younger than him
The Dutch, too, have some outstanding seasoned campaigners to call on,  such as the stars of their 1988 European Nations Cup win -- 32-year-old Ronald  Koeman and 31-year-old Frank Rijkaard plus PSV Eindhoven's Jan Wouters, 33 --  , all of whom have shown outstanding form for their clubs.
Rijkaard won his fourth Dutch title with Ajax this year and Koeman will  turn out for Barcelona against AC Milan in the European Champions Cup final on  May 18.
But the granddaddy of them all at USA '94 is likely to be Roger Milla, the  outstanding personality of the 1990 World Cup when his Cameroon team battled  against all the odds to reach the quarter-finals.
Milla's keen to do it over all again, and if he does he'll have just  turned 42, making him the oldest player ever to see World Cup action.
