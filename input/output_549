The UN mission here hit out Saturday at United  Nations Security Council delays in deploying fresh troops in Rwanda, as the  corpses of thousands of victims of the country's ethnic bloodbath surfaced in  neighbouring Uganda.
"A single day's delay is one day too much," said Moctar Gueye, a spokesman  for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) in the capital.
Reduced from 2,500 to around 400, the mission has become powerless to  prevent continuation of the carnage which aid agencies estimate has claimed at  least 200,000 lives in little more than five weeks.
On Friday in New York the Security Council postponed until next week a  vote on the planned deployment of 5,500 additional UN troops.
But Gueye added that he was hopeful that, once authorised, the  reinforcements would be capable of intervening to help secure an end to the  bloodletting.
Meanwhile sporadic bursts of heavy weapons continued in the Rwandan  capital Saturday as rebels fighters battled government troops for control of  the city, Gueye said.
The exchanges between rebels of the mainly minority Tutsi Rwanda Patriotic  Front (RPF) and the Hutu-dominated government forces, were limited to small  arms fire during the afternoon, Gueye said, adding: "The calm will not last."
Separately, health officials in Kampala said Saturday that Ugandans living  on the shores of Lake Victoria had had to bury thousands of corpses flowing  into the lake from Rwanda though the River Kagera.
The officials warned that unless the mass burials were expedited,  epidemics could break out as mutilated, decomposing bodies continued to flood  in.
Ugandan villagers have buried an estimated 26,000 bodies recovered from  the lake during the past three weeks, said Emmanuel Pinto, a deputy from  western Uganda.
The official New Vision newspaper reported on Friday that bodies were  arriving at the rate of 1,600 daily.
The UN World Health Organisation has supplied villagers with grave digging  tools to speed up the macabre exercise.
Earlier Saturday in Kigali, former French minister for humanitarian action  Bernard Kouchner called on the international community to help avert  "genocide" in the country.
"We cannot stand by and let genocide be perpetrated," said Kouchner, a  doctor who founded the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres and who  arrived here on Thursday and spent Friday touring orphanages and camps for  people made homeless by the conflict.
The UN Security Council postponed action on the Rwanda proposal until  early next week after around four hours of discussions.
British ambassador to the United Nations, Sir David Hannay, stressed all  delegates were aware of the urgency of the situation, but a US diplomat said  he believed Washington had not received sufficient details on where the  reinforcements would be deployed.
Diplomatic sources said there were unconfirmed reports that the force  would be composed of troops from Australia, Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal and  Tanzania, would include 800 troops deployed in Kigali to protect the airport  and other key sites.
Government sources in Canberra said Saturday that at least 10 western  countries, mostly European but including Australia, had been asked to make a  contribution to the new force.
Rwanda was plunged back into a murderous ethnic war on April 7, a day  after Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in what the government  denounced as a rocket attack on his plane.
Since then an estimated 500,000 Rwandans have fled to neighbouring  countries.
The RPF claimed on Friday it had won control of half the country.
