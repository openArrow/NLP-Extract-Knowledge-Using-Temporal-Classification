Claudio Caniggia, back from a 13-month ban  for cocaine use, will miss Argentina's friendly with Chile in Santiago on  Wednesday.
However, Diego Maradona, whose criminal conviction for cocaine use led to  Argentina pulling out of a tournament in Japan because he was refused a visa,  will be fit to play.
Argentine coach Alfio Basile said Caniggia had a leg strain and he did not  want to take any chances.
Ramon Medina Bello, who plays for Yokohama Marinos in Jjapan, may be given  a trial.
Maradona was expecting a hard match.
"Every time we play away the opposition considers stopping me a matter of  honour," he added.
Argentina were still looking for other opponents to complete their World  Cup buildup.
They play Israel at Tel Aviv on May 31 and Croatia in Zagreb on June 4.
