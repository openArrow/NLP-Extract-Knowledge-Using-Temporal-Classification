"This was a pretty good win for my head. It's been a long time since I  beat the number-one player in the world in a big match," said Courier after  his victory.
"I think the real turning point came in the third set when I managed to  break him after he was 40-15 up and serving."
Courier said he didn't want to get "over-excited" by his victory.
"It feels fantastic -- but there are more matches to come," he said.
