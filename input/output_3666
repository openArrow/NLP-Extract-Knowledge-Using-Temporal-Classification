The deputy mayor of Jerusalem, Schmuel Meir, has  called for PLO chief Yasser Arafat's assassination and offered a reward,  Haaretz newspaper reported Tuesday.
Meir, a member of the ultra-nationalist National Religious Party, also  proposed the killer be given the title of "honoured citizen of Jerusalem," the  daily said.
Haaretz did not disclose the reward on offer, and a municipality spokesman  would not comment on the report.
Meir, who is in charge of the municipality's treasury, has actively  campaigned to "Judaize" the Arab eastern sector of Jerusalem, which Israel  annexed after the 1967 Middle East war.
A former chief rabbi of Israel, Shlomo Goren, has also called for the PLO  leader's assassination.
National Religious Party official Yitzhak Levy and right-wing Likud  hardliners said on Monday they would do everything in their power to prevent  Arafat from stepping foot in Jerusalem.
