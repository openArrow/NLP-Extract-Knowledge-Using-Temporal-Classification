At least 32 people were injured Monday in clashes  between riot police and thousands of anti-nuclear demonstrators opposed to a  proposed nuclear waste dump on South Korea's eastern coast, news reports said.
Violence erupted in Uljin, 330 kilometers (190 miles) southeast of Seoul,  when thousands of riot police, helped by a helicopter, unleashed a tear gas  attack on 5,000 protesters, said the state-run broadcasting network.
The attack triggered swirling clashes, leaving 32 protesters and police  officers injured, the national Yonhap news agency said.
Groups of officers in riot gear chased demonstrators through clouds of  tear gas, and Yonhap said the protesters brandished iron pipes.
Almost all shops in Uljin, a major fishing base, were closed in a show of  support to the demonstrators, reflecting widespred sentiments against the  nuclear waste reservoir to be built there, the agency added.
Government plans to build nuclear waste dumps in remote rural areas have  faced strong objections by residents, despite offers for compensation.
Protesters in Uljin also urged the government to scrap plans to build new  facilities near their village, already the site of one of South Korea's nine  operational nuclear power plants, Yonhap said.
Some of the protesters torched piles of tires and pelted the police with  rocks and bottles, it said.
The protesters waived placards reading "Neither waste dump nor nuclear  plants!" and carried a mock hearse to dramatize their anti-nuclear message,  Yonhap said.
"The nuclear waste dump will kill all of us," one placard read.
