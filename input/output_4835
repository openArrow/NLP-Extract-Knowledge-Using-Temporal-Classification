Norway on Friday vowed to continue hunting the minke  whale and dismissed an international move to establish a whale sancutary in  the Antarctic as having no scientific basis.
"Norway's policy remains the same," foreign ministry spokesman Ingvar  Havnen told AFP. "The government should take a formal decision in a few weeks'  time on the quotas."
The hunting season for minke whales opens in June.
Norway did not take part in Thursday's vote by the International Whaling  Commission (IWC) to create a no-hunting zone in the fertile waters surrounding  the Antarctic.
Twenty-three nations supported the resolution, which was approved at an  IWC meeting in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Japan voted against the measure, while  six countries -- China, Dominica, Grenada, South Korea, St. Vincent and the  Grenadines and the Solomon Islands -- abstained.
Explaining the Norwegian position, Havnen said: "We really see no  scientific base for the establishment of such a zone and that's why we didn't  participate in the vote."
Norway resumed commercial whale hunting in June 1993 despite an IWC ban  adopted the same year at a meeting in Japan.
For the 1993 season, the Norwegian quota for minke whales -- who live in  the north Atlantic -- was set at 296. Of that total, 136 were caught as part  of a research effort endorsed by the commission's scientific committee,  according to Havnen.
"We strongly feel that the revised set of rules to regulate whaling all  over the world, which were agreed by the scientific committee in 1993, will  take care of the worries regarding the protection of the whale stock," he said.
Norway's whalers, from communities where there is little else to do, use  traditional methods to harpoon whales from a fleet of 20 to 30 boats, each  with a crew of three to six men.
