Syria is "blowing cool" as the United States  endeavours to bring it back to the Middle East peace table with Israel,  Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Thursday.
"We know the Syrians' methods," Peres told state radio. "Until an  agreement is concluded they blow cool winds in every direction."
"It is easy to reach an agreement with Lebanon but it has no value, while  with Syria it is difficult.
"But once it is done, it will be respected (by Syria)," Peres said.
The minister denied a Hebrew press report on Thursday that Israel had  agreed to let Syria have an early warning station in the Galilee as part of  reciprocal security arrangements in the event of a withdrawal from the Golan  Heights.
"These speculations are very premature. The problem with the Syrians is  not to sort out technical problems, but first to reach an agreeement in  principle which will then enable these problems to be solved."
The comments came after US Secretary of State Warren Christopher ended a  second shuttle mission between Jerusalem and Damascus in three weeks.
Christopher left Cairo on Thursday after admitting that there was still a  long way to go in the search to bring peace between Israel and Syria.
Damascus has nonetheless shown interest in an Israeli offer for a phased  withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which were captured in the 1967 Middle East.
