The United States is firmly committed to  bolstering Israeli security to help promote a withdrawal from the Golan  Heights and a peace accord with Syria, a White House official said Tuesday.
Anthony Lake, national security adviser to President Bill Clinton, said  Washington would seek to compensate Israel for the loss of the strategic  plateau Israel occupied in 1967 and annexed in 1981.
"The United States stands ready to participate in the security  arrangements that the parties negociate," Lake told a Washington forum.
"Specific discussions on what form that participation may take have not  yet begun, but our commitment is firm," he said.
"We will act decisively to bolster Israel's early warning capability and  ability to handle longer-range threats to compensate for strategic advantages  it may choose to give up for peace."
Lake's comments came as Secretary of State Warren Christopher continued  shuttling between Syria and Israel in an effort to keep peace discussions  alive.
Christopher was expected to go to Syria on Wednesday following up Israel's  peace package -- a phased withdrawal from the Golan Heights linked to security  arrangements in return for total peace.
Syria has refused any peace plan without the return of the Golan,  rejecting Israeli proposals for returning the territory in phases.
Lake said Washington viewed an Israeli-Syrian peace agreement as  strategically important that would isolate Iran and Iraq and "help form a  community of like-minded Middle Eastern states which share our goals of free  markets, democratic enlargement and controls on proliferation of weapons of  mass destruction and their delivery systems."
Lake's comments appeared to address Israeli demands for special security  if it takes the unpopular step of returning the Golan Heights.
"We do not underestimate the risks and costs involved in achieving an  Israeli-Syrian peace," said Lake.
But he added, "We will insist that the peace be real."
