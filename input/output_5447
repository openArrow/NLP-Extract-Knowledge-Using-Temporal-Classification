Ilie Nastase was barred from captaining Romania in  the Davis Cup here on Monday because of bad behaviour.
The International Tennis Federation announced the former player had been  banned from the match against Great Britain on July 15-17 because of his  antics during Romania's clash with South Africa in March.
Nastase had been reported by umpire Stephen Winyard after being given two  warnings and then being ordered away from the court side for using obcenities  and insults and trying to intimidate officials.
He was allowed to return on the second and third days of the match,  however, after the Romanian tennis federation apologised.
