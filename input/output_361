A former guerrilla leader running for president  burst into a studio in the middle of a televised debate between the two  leading candidates to protest his being excluded from the program.
Antonio Navarro, who headed the M-19 movement known for its spectacular  stunts, suddenly appeared in the television studio Thursday where the first  debate of its kind in Colombia's political history was taking place between  Liberal Party candidate Ernesto Sampler and Conservative Andres Pastrana.
"Hello Antonio," was all the terrified Samper could manage to say, while a  calmer Pastrana said, "Would you like to sit down with us, Antonio?"
The moderator, television personality Yamid Amat, ended the awkwardness by  ordering a cut to a commercial. After the break, Navarro was gone.
The ex-guerrlla leader, who according to polls is likely to get less than  10 percent of the vote in the May 29 elections, said in a radio interview  shortly after the incident that he wanted to show there were more than just  two candidates on the scene.
Navarro's M-19 movement grabbed the headlines for stealing Simon Bolivar's  sword in 1976, taking over the Dominican Republic embassy in 1980 and  attacking the capital's justice center in 1985, an incident in which some 20  people died. He left the guerrilla movement in 1990.
