The National Bank of Belgium trimmed its key  directive central rate by 0.10 percentage points from 5.35 to 5.25 percent  here Wednesday following a similar reduction a week ago.
The Belgian central bank also lowered several other interest rates,  including the rate for overnight advances to financial institutions within  their credit ceilings, which fell from 6.85 to 6.75 percent.
But the discount rate was unchanged at 4.50 percent.
The central rate, accorded to financial institutions dealing in the public  debt, has dropped from 7.50 to 5.25 percent since December 7, when the Belgian  central bank began a series of incremental interest rate cuts.
