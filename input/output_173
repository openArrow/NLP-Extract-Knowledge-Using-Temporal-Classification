Boxing legend Muhammad Ali has passed on one of the  secrets of his success to young Vietnamese aspirants, advising them not to  sleep with their girlfriends three weeks before a bout.
The former three times heavyweight boxing champion was warmly received  late Thursday by boxing hopefuls at a training centre in the Vietnamese  capital.
Ali is known here for having refused military service during the Vietnam  War. He was stripped of his first world heavyweight title in 1970 because of  it.
But encouraged by the enthusiasm shown by young boxers here, the  52-year-old Ali who suffers from Parkinson's disease was carried back to his  years as a famous pugilist, displaying punch combinations and testing the  reflexes of his admiring fans.
"You have the potential to become good boxers and everbody I met today is  fast," he said after meeting with about 20 youths, who challenged him as  sparring partners, and passing on some advice.
Ali said he was willing to help Vietnam develop boxing and sponsor  meetings between amateurs here and in the United States.
Ali has been on a goodwill mission here since Tuesday aimed at assisting  in settling the fate of 2,234 US soldiers still listed as missing in action  since the war.
He was accompanied here by the families of two American pilots who were  lost in action over the border with Laos, and asked Vietnamese authorities to  approach their Laotian counterparts in resolving the pilots' cases.
On Thursday, Ali told Minister of Youth and Sports Ha Quang Du that he had  made the right decision "in refusing to serve in Vietnam."
Ali is scheduled to leave Vietnam Saturday after visiting Danang on Friday.
