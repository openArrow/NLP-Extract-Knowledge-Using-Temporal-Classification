The Israeli army apologized Sunday after mixing  up the bodies of two soldiers, who were shot dead on the Gaza Strip on Friday,  leading a family to bury the wrong man, a military spokesman said.
As the relatives of Corporal Erez Ben Baruch prepared for his funeral on  Sunday they were informed that he had already been buried two days earlier.
"The army has sent its condolences and apologizes to the families and will  do everything it can to find out what caused the mistake and to ensure those  responsible are made to pay," the spokesman said.
"On Friday one of the men was buried under the identity of his friend."
The army said suspicions of a mix-up were aroused only on Sunday as the  second body was being prepared in a Tel Aviv hospital mortuary.
Reserve soldiers Moshe Bukra, 30, and Ben Baruch, 24, were killed by  Islamic fundamentalists at a roablock near the Erez crossing.
The army appointed a general to lead an inquiry into the mix-up.
