Japan's NEC Corp. plans to boost production of  16-megabit dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips at its plants in the  United States, Singapore and Ireland, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said Saturday.
NEC Electronics, a US subsidiary of the major computer company, will  invest additional seven billion yen (68 million dollars) in expanding  facilities to raise its monthly output, the daily said.
The US firm, which started manufacturing 16-megabit DRAM chips this year,  will boost production from hundreds of thausand units a month to 1.5 million  units by March next year, the newspaper said.
NEC will also raise production of 16-megabit DRAM chips at its Singapore  subsidiary from the current 200,000 level to one million by December, while it  plans to prepare its plant in Ireland for making 200,000 per month within the  year.
