Sunday's Indianapolis 500 will be  unlike any race here in a generation, with a horde of hungry newcomers  replacing legends who have driven here for 30 years.
Retiring Mario Andretti makes his final start here Sunday. Four-time Indy  500 winner Al Unser Snr and three-time winner Johnny Rutherford retired this  month, following A.J. Foyt's departure last year.
"It's always sad for us because we were here for the long ride," Andretti  said. "We have had to realize there's not a hell of a lot left because we used  it all up."
In their place comes a new generation. This year's race features nine  first-time Indy 500 starters and nine others with only one or two prior starts  here. That inexperience, combined with speeds above 240 mph (384 km/h), makes  some veterans nervous.
"I'm concerned," reigning champion Emerson Fittipaldi of Brazil said. "We  have had some bad experiences with young drivers. You have to take it  carefully at Indianapolis. It's a high-risk race. But most of them are ready."
England's Nigel Mansell never raced on an oval before his third-place  finish here last year. He mastered the circular courses for four victories and  the Indy series crown last year. Even though he is a novice at Indy, the  former Formula One world champion has the wisdom of time.
"We have a different perspective than the younger drivers," Mansell said.  "They are a little crazier, a little more dangerous because they haven't been  hurt yet. But things change when they take that first lap year. You see  450,000 people standing and screaming for you."
