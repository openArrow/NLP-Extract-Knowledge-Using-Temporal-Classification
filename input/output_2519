The Portland Trail Blazers, who had their  worst National Basketball Association season since 1989 and lost in the first  round of the playoffs, fired coach Rick Adelman Friday.
"Rick is a class individual," said team owner Paul Allen. "He is a fine  human being. People like that are rare in any business. It does make these  kinds of decisions especially hard, but in the final analysis, you have to do  what you believe is right for the organization and the team."
Adelman's departure follows that of his friend Geoff Petrie, who resigned  as head of the Blazers' basketball operations on Tuesday.
Blazers star Clyde Drexler said it remained to be seen if the shake-up  would produce the desired results.
"Some people may say it's a very sad day and I agree," Drexler said. "Some  people may say it's a new beginning or a new dawn. That we'll have to wait and  see."
