Japan and the United States will hold working-level  "framework" trade talks in Washington in early June, government sources said  on Friday.
The talks on June 2-3 will centre on motor vehicles and related parts, the  sources said.
Tokyo and Washington agreed on Tuesday to resume framework negotiations,  aimed at cutting Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States.
Framework talks have been suspended since February when the then Japanese  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and US President Bill Clinton failed to reach  agreement.
