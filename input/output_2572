Edberg, 28, and bidding for the only major title that has eluded him in a  senior career which started in 1983, has to play fellow-Swede Henrik Holm in  the first round -- and that could prove to be his toughest clash until he  reaches a fourth-round meeting with either 14th seed Cedric Pioline of France  or rising Russian star Yevgeny Kafelnikov.
Goran Ivanisevic, seeded fifth but currently struggling to find his touch  and confidence, failed to win a match at either Madrid or Hamburg. And  although he reached the last eight at both Monte Carlo and Rome he was  comprehensively beaten both times -- by Bruguera in Monte Carlo and by Becker  in Italy.
The 22-year-old Croatian has drawn a qualifier for the first-round but  could face another big-server in the shape of Switzerland's Marc Rosset in the  third.
Squashed beteen Ivanisevic and twelfth-seeded Petr Korda will be veteran  Ivan Lendl.
Lendl will probably find himself playing the role of 'bad guy' when he  takes on popular French player Arnaud Boetsch in front of the home crowd.  Lendl who won here in 1984, 1986 and 1987, hasn't got past the second round in  his last two visits, but he still thinks he can cause an upset. And he has  proved as much this season by reaching the fourth-round at the Australian  Open, the final at Sydney, a semi-final in Hong Kong and four quarter-finals  -- at Dubai, Tokyo, Madrid and Coral Springs.
