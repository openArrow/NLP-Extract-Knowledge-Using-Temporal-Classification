Bosnian Serb forces shelled Tuzla airport in  northeastern Bosnia a few minutes after a UN relief plane landed there  Tuesday, UN Protection Force officials said here.
UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi immediately condemned the attack and said  he had protested to Serb leader Radovan Karadzic over the incident, which  comes ahead of peace talks scheduled in Geneva Thursday.
The aircraft, an Ilyushin-76 arriving from Split in Croatia, took off  again without unloading after nine shells landed in the close vicinity of the  airport within a 20-minute period. There were no casualties.
One of the shells landed 20 metres (yards) away from the emergency  services' base, and another 200 metres (yards) from the airport's control  tower, an UNPROFOR statement said.
A radar system operated by a Jordanian contingent attached to the UN  Nordic Battalion revealed that the shells were fired from Bosnian Serb  position 16 kilometers (10 miles) southeast of the airport, the statement  added.
"Mr. Akashi said that such deliberate targeting of UNPROFOR, only a few  days before scheduled talks in Geneva on a general ceasefire agreement in  Bosnia and Herzegovina, was regrettable," it said. "Mr. Akashi has expressed  his deep concern regarding this incident to Dr. Karadzic."
Tuzla airport was targeted by Serb artillery Monday afternoon when two  shells were fired at it. Previous to that there had been no bombardments since  May 17.
