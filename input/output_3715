A Polish man went on trial Tuesday for allegedly  killing two people after giving them drug-laced vodka so he could rob them  during train trips, the PAP news agency said.
Identified only as Antoni O., the 46-year-old man was arrested at the  railway in the western city of Poznan after some 30 people identified him as  having drugged and robbed them.
They said he took everything -- money, jewelry, watches, clothes and shoes.
The defendant was said to have worked trains heading from the border of  the former Soviet Union to the town of Szczecin in northwest Poland.
Drinking and sharing vodka is customary among passengers on trains in  Russia and to a lesser extent in other eastern European states.
