The new director-general of the United Nations Food  and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), Senegal's Jacques Diouf, unveiled plans  Monday for a "green revolution" reform to help countries hit by food shortages.
Opening a three-day meeting of FAO's ruling council, Diouf proposed  holding a "world food summit" in the Italian capital early 1996 to win  high-level support for the campaign against growing food shortages.
"The FAO cannot accept the human tragedy of 800 million people who do not  have enough to eat," said Diouf, an expert in tropical agriculture who was  elected director-general last November in place of Edouard Saouma of Lebanon.
The new chief is aiming for decentralisation and greater efficiency in the  49-member body, limited to a budget of 673.1 million dollars for 1994-95.
He supported special measures to defend food production in countries which  are net food importers, promising a "green revolution" based on productive and  viable new technologies which would allow a fairer distribution of profits.
He also wants to focus attention on forests and fisheries, calling for a  meeting of forestry ministers to be held alongside a special FAO committee  scheduled for next March.
The FAO would push for compliance with international accords on preserving  stocks of overexploited fish species and invite fishery ministers to the next  session of its fishing committee next spring, set to adopt an international  code on "responsible" fishing, he said.
