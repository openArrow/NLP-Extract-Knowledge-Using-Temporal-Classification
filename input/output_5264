Thousands of motorcycles roared past the White  House Sunday to protest the lifting of the US trade embargo on Hanoi despite  unresolved cases of US soldiers missing since the Vietnam War.
"President (Bill) Clinton sold out our POWS to big business," read the  banners flown by the bikers, many dressed in black leather and chains, who  cruised to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.
Police estimated some 40,000 people attended the seventh annual "Rolling  Thunder" rally for those taken prisoner of war (POW) or missing in action  (MIA) during the southeast Asian conflict.
Participants, many of them war veterans, estimated that as many as 100,000  joined the procession down Pennsylvania Avenue.
"Every veteran has the right -- the absolute right -- to come home,"  organizers said a letter issued to Clinton. "The special interests of  individuals and corporations, who are bound morally, only by the bottom line,  have no place in this matter."
Clinton lifted the nearly 20-year trade embargo on Vietnam earlier this  year and began the process of reestablishing full recognition by agreeing to a  framework for establishing diplomatic missions.
"Clinton abandoned his duty in the 60s and abandoned our POWs in the 90s,"  said a sign referring to the president's draft avoidance during the Vietnam  War.
