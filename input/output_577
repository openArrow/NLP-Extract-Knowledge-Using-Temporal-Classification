Matsuda began racing at age 20 in go-carts, with Mario Andretti as his  idol. By qualifying, he should get the chance to race alongside Andretti in  the veteran's final Indy start.
After his first racing season, Matsuda took an insurance job and did not  race again until age 28. He went on to drive Formula 3 cars.
"My parents wanted me to become a doctor, but I just wanted to be a race  driver," he said.
Matsuda's wife Yoshiko is the sister of Beat Takeshi, a Japanese comedian  who convinced Matsuda to take his love of Indy seriously. After assembling  enough sponsor money for a car, Matsuda made his dreams reality.
"The intensity was the same here as racing in Japan," he said. "The thing  that bothered me was the turbulence."
