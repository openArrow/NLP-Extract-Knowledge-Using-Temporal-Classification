Flamboyant defense lawyer Ellis Rubin said  Friday he had been hired by a teen who plans to tell all about tennis  phenomenon Jennifer Capriati's off-court life.
Rubin said 18-year-old Nathan Wilson, a high school dropout who has been  treated for substance abuse, has known Capriati for about a month and planned  to discuss her recent activities at a press conference on Saturday.
Wilson's story "involves sex, drugs and an entire lost weekend -- things  people shouldn't do, and all of them initiated by our tennis star, contrary to  what has come out so far," Rubin said.
Capriati was arrested for possession of marijuana on May 16 at a Florida  motel. Wilson was among those who attended the weekend party at a room rented  by Capriati.
"This kid happens to be telling the truth," said Rubin, who is running for  a seat in the US Senate.
"We checked out his story. Apparently, he has been getting threatening  calls from the other kids (who were at the party). He has been getting  attacked in the press by Capriati's attorney."
Wilson has already said he saw Capriati smoke crack cocaine and use heroin  before she was arrested.
Two other people arrested with her, 20-year-old Tom Wineland and  17-year-old Timineet Branagan, were charged with possessing crack cocaine and  heroin, but police said there was no evidence Capriati used either.
Capriati, 18, entered a drug rehabilitation programme days after her  arrest.
Wilson has not been charged, and Rubin did not say why he had been hired,  though he did say it was Wilson's mother who approached him.
Rubin has been associated with several high-profile cases. He offered a  nymphomaniac defense for a woman who worked as a prostitute out of her home,  and lost a murder case using televivision intoxication as a defense.
