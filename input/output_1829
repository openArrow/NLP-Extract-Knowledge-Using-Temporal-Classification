Ballot counting was suspended Wednesday in a  tight Dominican presidential race amid charges of widespread fraud, with the  opposition warning of a popular uprising unless new elections were called.
With all but a small portion of ballots counted, President Joaquin  Balaguer held a slim lead over his principal challenger in his bid for a  seventh non-consecutive term as president of the Dominican Republic.
But the Central Election Board said it was suspending its final report  declaring a winner in Monday's presidential vote until it had considered a  complaint by 57-year-old populist candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez  contesting the results.
The partial returns showed the blind, 87-year-old Balaguer with 42.57  percent of the vote to 41.16 for Pena Gomez, who hopes to become the country's  first black president this century. Former president Juan Bosch was third with  13 percent.
Balaguer has denied fraud charges.
"The elections have been clean and pure," he insisted.
But Balaguer said Wednesday he would agree to new elections if serious  irregularities are proven to have marred the vote.
"I respect the decisions of the electoral board and I will comply with its  orders," the president said. "If there is something serious, the election  should be annulled and carried out again, but that is up to the board."
Pena Gomez charged that the names of some 200,000 voters were stricken  from computerized electoral lists and maintained that a "civilian army" of his  supporters stood ready to defend Dominican democracy if the elections are  tainted.
