China Tuesday welcomed a statement from the  United States that it does not recognize a Tibetan government-in-exile.
A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said that "while expressing our  appreciation, we hope the US government will honor its commitment in real  earnest," according to the Xinhua news agency monitored here.
US State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said in Washington Monday that  "I would say it is long-standing US policy that Tibet is part of China.  Neither the United States nor any other state regards Tibet as a sovereign  nation."
"The United States does not recognize a Tibetan government-in-exile," he  told reporters.
The Chinese ministry spokesman added that when the Dalai Lama admits Tibet  is an inalienable part of China, entirely gives up his stand for the  "independence of Tibet" and stops his activities aimed at splitting China,  then China "is ready to hold negotiations with him at any time, which will  cover any subject except independence for Tibet."
The Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, has lived in exile in India for  nearly 35 years. China has come under international criticism for alleged  human-rights abuses in Tibet.
