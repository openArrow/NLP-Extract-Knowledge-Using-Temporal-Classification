Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader  Mangosuthu Buthelezi Saturday urged his supporters to work for reconciliation  and peace in South Africa's violence-wracked black areas.
"Go out and break down the barriers that divide you from your political  opponenents," he said in a speech at a rally in KwaZulu-Natal where his party  trounced the African National Congress (ANC) in the April 26-29 election.
"Go out and spread the word of peace and reconciliation," he said. "There  can be no economic development in the region until we achieve peace. No  businessman will want to invest in this region if his life is in danger. No  investor will want to build factories if their factories are going to be  burned down."
Nelson Mandela's ANC swept to victory in the national poll, but lost in  Buthelezi's KwaZulu-Natal powerbase. The IFP came third nationally, after the  former ruling National Party and together the three parties make up the  government of national unity that was announced on Wednesday.
In a peace-broking move, Mandela gave Buthelezi the powerful Home Affairs  Ministry in his 27-member cabinet.
The two parties have engaged in bloody conflict in KwaZulu-Natal, where  10,000 people have been killed since 1990.
In his first speech as Home Affairs Minister, Buthelezi said Saturday: "We  will have to to work at political reconciliation if we are to end up with a  national will to make democracy work for the benefit of the people."
