Northern Yemeni forces Monday seized the rival  south's main air base, which controls a highway leading to the southern  stronghold of Aden.
An AFP photographer saw about 50 northern soldiers on the outskirts of the  Al-Anad base and on roads leading to Sanaa in the north and to Aden further  south.
The base is about 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Aden.
The base was quiet. Northern tanks, artillery canons and anti-aircraft  guns took up positions on the roads.
The official news agency of the north, SABA, had reported the fall of the  base earlier in the day but this was denied by a southern military spokesman.
The two sides lurched into civil war on May 5 after months of arguing over  how to run the country, formed from the unification of conservative North  Yemen and poorer, Marxist South Yemen.
