Around 4,000 people have died and hundreds have  been wounded in fighting between rival Kurdish factions in northern Iraq this  month, the official Iranian news agency IRNA said Tuesday.
IRNA said clashes which erupted since early May between the two main  factions in northern Iraq, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and Patriotic  Union of Kurdistan (PUK), was "the worst of its kind since the Kurdish  uprising" against the Baghdad regime in 1991.
"About 4,000 have been killed and hundreds wounded in clashes between PUK  and KDP this month," the agency added.
IRNA did not provide a source for the casualty toll, which is much higher  than the "hundreds of dead" given by Kurdish sources.
Tehran radio said Monday that thousands of Kurds had fled their homes in  northeastern Iraq amid intensified fighting between the two factions.
Northern Iraq has been under Kurdish control since it was established with  the help of the US-led coalition that drove Iraqi occupying forces out of  Kuwait in February 1991.
