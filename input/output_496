England's FA Cup final between Chelsea and  Manchester United here on Saturday remained goalless at half-time in a  typically super-charged, yet scrappy match.
Denmark's Jakob Kjeldbjerg nearly stole the limelight in this most  prestigious sporting fixture in the English calendar.
From a Denis Wise free-kick after 33-minutes, the ball came at an awkward  height for Chelsea's John Spencer on the edge of the box. He shot lamely, but  the ball came out nicely for Kjeldbjerg, who fired straight at Schmeichel.
The match began with a crowded midfield and slippery pitch stifling skill  and any flowing moves. Norwegian Erland Johnsen was booked in the first minute  for a foul on Giggs as the Londoners gave a first showing of their rugged  tactics.
Manchester United skipper Steve Bruce also went into the book in the 18th  minute as the double-chasers became more and more frustrated. Though United  began the match as overwhelming favourites, it was Chelsea who gained the  upper hand midway through the half.
Mark Stein had the first real chance in the 22nd minute at the near post.  And three minutes later, his Chelsea striker partner John Spencer just failed  to make contact in front of Schmeichel's goal.
Moments afterwards, Gavin Peacock confirmed the Londoners superiority as  he hit the crossbar with Schmeichel well beaten. It was Peacock who scored  both goals as Chelsea did a league double over champions United this season.
In the 37th minute, France's Eric Cantona headed across Chelsea's goal,  but Mark Hughes just failed to connect with a header as he sprinted forward.
The most positive player in the first half was Ukrainian winger Andrei  Kanchelskis, whose pace continually threatened Chelsea's defence.
