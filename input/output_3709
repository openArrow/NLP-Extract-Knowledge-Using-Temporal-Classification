A group of 17 pro-democracy activists arrested  during an election of delegates to a constitutional conference called by the  military regime, appeared in court here on Tuesday to be formally charaged, a  human rights activist said.
They were charged with attempting to disrupt the election, unlawful  assembly and causing a breach of the peace, said the human rights activist,  who is a lawyer.
The arrested activists - who included Tokunbo Afikuyomi, a special  assistant to Foreign Minister Baba Gan Kingibe,  Senator Bola Tinubu and  Olusegun Mayegun ex-president of the National Association of Nigerian Students  - were arrested in several parts of lagos during the election exercise on  Monday.
Twelve of them were granted bail after paying a mandatory fine of 10,000  naira (455 dollars) imposed on them by the Yaba magistrates (lower) court,  said the source.
Meanwhile, a 17-year-old pro-democracy activist, Sunday Saji also  arrested on Monday is still being detained, a statement by the Campaign for  Democracy (CD) said.
The CD, which is the umbrella group for about 40 human rights and  pro-democracy associations in Nigeria, called for the immediate release of the  teenager.
Pro-democracy groups called for a boycott of the elections held at ward  level on Monday for the constitutional conference.  Instead they want the  military to step down and a sovereign national conference to be convened to  debate the country's future.
