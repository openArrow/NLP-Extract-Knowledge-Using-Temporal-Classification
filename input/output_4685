Mikael Tillstrom, a qualifier who has never featured  in the world's top-100, continued his remarkable 'giant-killing' progress at  the French Open here on Friday when he defeated sixteenth-seed Richard  Krajicek in straight-sets to reach the fourth-round of the men's singles.
The 24-year-old Swede, a left-hander who is playing in his first-ever  Grand Slam event, raced to a 7-6 (7/4) 6-2, 6-3 victory.
Currently ranked 226th by the ATP computer, the Gothenburg player had to  compete in last week's strenuous qualifying tournament to reach the main draw  and his highest-ever ranking remains 117th two years ago.
Krajicek, a 6ft 5in (Im96) giant who reached the semi-finals twelve months  ago, won his fifth career title at Barcelona this year after several months  absence because of tendinitis of the knee.
But against Tillsrom he was never able to get his normally lethal big  serves working.
Tillstrom will have his work cut out if he is to reach the quarter-finals,  however. In the next round he faces world number-one Pete Sampras.
Sampras earlier dropped just six games putting out Paul Haarhuis of the  Netherlands.
