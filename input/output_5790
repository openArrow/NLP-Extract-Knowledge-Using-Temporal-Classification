Greece is determined to take "drastic measures" to  protect the interests of the Greek minority in Albania, Foreign Minister  Carolos Papoulias said here Tuesday.
Papoulias was responding to an overture made Monday by Albanian President  Sali Berisha who indicated his willingness to resume talks with Greece over  the status of the ethnic Greek minority in a part of southern Albania which  Greek nationalists claim belongs to Greece.
"The latest crackdown against the Greek minority have changed the climate,  and we will not accept to pursue a dialogue considering the conditions under  which the Greek minority is living," Papoulias said.
He added, however, that he was not rejecting talks on the issue but that  such a dialogue had to be prepared in advance.
"I hope the Albanian government has understood what is in its best  interest," Papoulias said.
The foreign minister warned Monday that Athens would close its border to  Albanian migrant workers if bilateral relations continued to deteriorate.
On Tuesday, Greek Defense Minister Gerassimos Arsenis visited the  Greek-Albanian border to insure that armed troops posted there were  "fulfilling their duty."
He said he planned to tour villages affected by the influx of migrant  workers and would look at ways to "ensure better border protection."
Greece has persistently accused Albania of persecuting its Greek minority,  estimated by Athens to number 400,000 but put at just 60,000 by Albanian  authorities.
