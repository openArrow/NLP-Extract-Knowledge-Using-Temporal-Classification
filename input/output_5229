Pole-sitter Al Unser Jnr won his  second Indianapolis 500 here Sunday after a heart-breaking crash eliminated  leader Emerson Fittipaldi 16 laps from the finish.
Unser, who also won in 1992, took the checkered flag under caution  conditions here Sunday in a crash-filled race, giving his four-time winner  father, Al Unser Snr, a special 55th birthday present.
Fittipaldi had dominated the race, leading 145 laps and appearing set for  his second straight Indy 500 triumph. But he slammed into the fourth-turn wall  on lap 184 and finished 17th.
"I'm very disappointed," the Brazilian said. "I was so close. I had  everything in control."
Fittipaldi lost control of his Mercedes-powered Penske exiting the fourth  turn, sending the rear of the car into the outer wall. The rear wing shredded  off and the car skidded to a stop on the main straightaway, just short of the  start-finish line.
"He got out there too far and the old vacuum cleaner got him," Unser said.
Fittipaldi, a former Formula One and Indy-car series champion, shook his  raised hands in frustration as he sat helpless in the cockpit.
That left Unser in the lead and he maintained his margin over first-time  Indianapolis starter Jacques Villeneuve of Canada to take the title. Stan Fox  crashed three laps from the end, forcing the race to end under caution a  caution, with overtaking prohibited.
Mercedes' victory marked the first time in 70 years that an engine running  here for the first time had won the Indy 500.
