Soon will not be soon enough for Rahal, who practiced this week in an  Ilmor-powered Penske car and reached 224 mph (360 km/h). He should be able to  requalify if bumped, but snubbing Honda was not a decision made lightly.
"It caused a few sleepless nights," the owner-driver said. "We're looking  forward to a long relationship developing their engine. But we felt we needed  something special at this race."
Making the Indy field is important to Rahal's other sponsors, already  unhappy after he was bumped out of last year's Indy field.
"Our confidence in Honda and its program tells me it's mainly a short-term  risk," Rahal said. "Yet we have a tremendous obligation to do the best we can  do to get into the race. At times it has been frustrating."
"There are a lot of demands they have never faced before and they have  learned very quickly. I have confidence in Honda, long-term and short-term,"  Rahal said.
Honda's Indy-car effort is separate from the successful Formula One  effort, even though it uses the same method of test and improve.
"Less than half the staff on this project comes from the Formula One  team," Clark said. "The main guys are not from Formula One. They are new and  have never dealt with Indy-car or F1 engines."
"It has been a little disappointing, but we have a lot to learn," Clark  said. "This is our first time at Indy, after all."
If a dozen other challengers have their way, however, the sun will set on  Honda's race effort before the green flag falls.
