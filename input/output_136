Thousands of refugees from Rwanda's ethnic  slaughter have fled to northern Burundi and put a great strain on the  country's limited relief food stocks, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) stated  Friday.
In a statement faxed to AFP here on Friday from the Burundian capital,  Bujumbura, WFP officials said the greatest influx was in the northeastern  province of Muyinga, where the refugee population rose from 2,000 to 20,000 in  less than a week.
Many of the refugees in Muyinga have arrived in a weakened state, some  with wounds and most with few or no provisions, a WFP official based in Ngozi  said Thursday, according to the statement.
Refugees from Rwanda, where an estimated 200,000 people have died in civil  war and bloodletting between the minority Tutsi and majority Hutu tribes,  started crossing into Burundi a month ago, but the rate of arrivals suddenly  rose last week as the refugee influx to Tanzania slowed.
A total of 63,000 Rwandan refugees are now located in Burundi's north and  northeastern provinces of Kayanza (5,700), Kirundo (13,500), Ngozi (17,000)  and Muyinga (26,500), the statement said.
To meet the growing needs of 900,000 people currently affected in Burundi,  WFP has had to borrow food from relief stocks already in place for internally  displaced people and Burundian returnees. Serious logistical constraints  continue to make delivery of adequate food rations to Burundi very difficult,  the statement added.
Before the Rwandan and Burundian presidents, Juvenal Habyarimana and  Cyprien Ntaryamira, were both killed in a suspected rocket attack on their  plane the Rwandan capital Kigali on April 6, triggering the Hutu-Tutsi war in  Rwanda, WFP was already feeding 680,000 Burundians affected by ethnic violence  resulting from the October 21 failed military coup which killed Burundi's  first elected president from the Hutu majority, Melchior Ndadaye.
But after April 6, an additional 145,000 Burundians returned from refugee  camps in Rwanda, and with 63,000 new arrivals from Rwanda, the WFP has to  provide them with relief until they can sustain themselves and/or return  safely to their homes, the statement added.
