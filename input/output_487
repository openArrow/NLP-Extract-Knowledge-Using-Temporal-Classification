Troops loyal to Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Saleh   have captured the key town of Daleh, north of Aden, after several days of  fierce fighting, correspondents said Saturday.
Local and foreign journalists taken to Daleh, which lies 90 kilometres (55  miles) from the southern stronghold of Aden, confirmed it was held by northern  troops.
Northern military officials said they captured the town on Friday.
Daleh controls a key position on the road to the main southern air base.  Several days of fighting around the area has forced residents to flee, seeking  safety in Aden.
With the loss of Daleh, the south called Saturday for the Arab League to  intervene to stop 10 days of war between rival northern and southern troops,  Aden Radio said.
The Council for the Coordination between Parties and the Masses,  Organizations and Nationalists in Aden sent a message to the League urging it  to protect "towns and citizens against all acts of aggression," it  said,  monitored by the BBC.
The League should intervene to see that a reconciliation accord signed in  Amman in February between the two parties is implemented, it added.
An Arab League delegation has been in Yemen since Thursday trying to  broker a ceasefire between Saleh and his southern rival, ousted vice-president  Ali Salem al-Baid.
A seven-point peace plan put forward by the southern Yemen Socialist Party  on Friday was swiftly rejected as "nothing new" by northern leaders.
