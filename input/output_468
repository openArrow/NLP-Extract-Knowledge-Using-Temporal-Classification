Passengers travelling South African Airways  (SAA) will face a barrage of greetings in at least four languages, in keeping  with the new South Africa, the national carrier said in a statement Saturday.
In the bad old days of apartheid South Africa, travellers on SAA were  addressed in two languages, Afrikaans first and then English.
From Saturday, four days after Nelson Mandela's inauguaration as the  country's first democratically-elected president, passengers will be greeted  in English first, then Afrikaans, then Zulu and Sotho. And on international  flights "a greeting appropriate to the country of destination or origin" as  well, SAA said in a statement.
"It is important that SAA be accepted by its diverse passengers," SAA  chief executive Mike Myburgh said in the statement.
"We are excited about the rebirth of a new South Africa and we must align  ourselves with the evident change and with international acceptance now that  we have become part of the world market again."
SAA was also busy scraping the old orange, blue and white South African  flag off all its aircraft and replacing it with the new, predominantly black,  green and gold one.
