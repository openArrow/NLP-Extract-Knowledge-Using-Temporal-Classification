Another bid by China to host the Olympics would be  enthusiastically welcomed by the International Olympic Comittee, the IOC  president Juan Antonio Samaranch made clear Friday.
Samaranch, here on a three-day tour of preparations for the 2000 games for  which Sydney defeated Beijing last September, said IOC officials were  currently discussing with Beijing whether it would bid for the 2004 games.
"Yes, we would like them to bid again," he said. "It would be very good  for the Olympic movement."
He also reaffirmed IOC hopes of trying to help Sarajevo, site of the 1984  winter Olympics, to rebuild sports facilities destroyed in the civil war.
Samaranch, who visited Sarajevo to make an appeal for peace in February,  said the movement planned to spend up to 10 million US dollars in the  reconstruction of its sporting facilities when peace returns.
He complimented Sydney on the progress it had made. He said Barcelona had  done nothing a year after winning the contest to host 1992 games. "And we had  to push them."
The chief executive in charge of organising the Sydney games should be  named in three weeks, organising committee chairman Gary Pemberton said.
Pemberton said an initial field of 150 had been narrowed to two  "high-performance" Australian candidates for the 400,000 dollar (290,000 US) a  year job.
