Japan's Justice Minister Hiroshi Nakai said Saturday  that Japan could not make an exception and issue a visa to Argentine soccer  star Diego Maradona.
Maradona has been refused entry to Japan with the Argentine soccer squad  because of a drug conviction.
In an interview with Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK), Nakai said, "I know  Maradona is a superstar. I know about Japan's soccer boom. But we cannot make  a special case for him."
He said Japan was conducting an anti-drug drive so could not issue a visa  to Maradona because his drug record was relatively recent.
The 33-year-old soccer player was arrested in Buenos Aires in 1991 for  cocaine possession and charged in 1992 in Italy for drug use.
Maradona was invited by the Japan Football Association as a member of the  Argentine national team to participate in a three-nation tournament here  scheduled for May 22-29.
Japan failed to win a place in the World Cup finals, but soccer is a boom  sport with the launch of the nation's first professional football league last  year.
