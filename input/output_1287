The British food giant Allied-Lyons on Tuesday  announced a 20-percent increase in annual pre-tax profits to 606 million  pounds (909 million dollars) compared with 505 million pounds for the previous  year.
The results for the year to March 5 were slightly better than analysts'  expectations of 604 million pounds. Turnover rose to 5.526 billion pounds from  5.266 billion the previous year.
The annual dividend rose to 22.2 pence from 21 pence a year earlier, while  earnings per share were up at 39.8 pence from 35.2 pence.
The pre-tax profit included a six-million pound gain from currency  conversion compared with the gain in 1992.
Chairman Michael Jackaman said that the current year had "started  satisfactorily" but that "much would depend on the performances of the western  European and Mexican economies".
"With economic growth in the US and Britain we can look forward to making  further progress," he added.
Last year showed "good progress" for the company, despite a "challenging"  world environment, Jackaman said.
The company's tax charge fell to 34.3 percent from 40.2 percent a year  earlier, mainly as a result of reorganisation and a restructuring of costs.
Allied-Lyons said that the sales of wines and spirits, such as Courvoisier  cognac, Ballantine's whisky, and Beefeater gin, had fallen by three percent to  1.931 billion pounds from 1.991 billion pounds the previous year.
Operating profit rose by five percent to 434 million pounds from 413  million pounds a year earlier.
Retailing sales rose by seven percent to 1.716 billion pounds from 1.604  billion pounds, and operating profit rose to 209 million pounds from 195  million pounds.
Brewing sales from labels including Carlsberg-Tetley, rose by eight  percent to 1.187 billion pounds from 1.103 billion pounds. Operating profit  rose to 96 million pounds from 91 million pounds.
Finally, food sales rose by 13 percent to 1.068 billion pounds from 971  million pounds. Operating profit rose by one million pounds to 87 million  pounds.
On Wednesday, the company is to sign a 739-million-pound deal which will  give Allied-Lyons control of the Spanish-Mexican wines and spirits group Pedro  Domecq, creating the world's second-largest drinks company.
The purchase is to be financed mainly by a two-for-13 rights issue at 490  pence per share to raise around 651 million pounds net of expenses.
The price of shares in the company fell by six pence to 584 by midday.
