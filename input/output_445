Austrian Formula One driver Karl Wendlinger  remains in a stable condition after his crash on Thursday, doctors said here  Saturday.
One doctor, speaking on grounds of anonymity, said that the trauma  suffered by Wendlinger's brain "appeared stable" following a scan at Nice's  university hospital where the driver, still in a deep coma, is being treated.
But there appeared grounds for cautious optimism, as the doctor added: "He  has come through the first 48 hours after the accident -- during which the  chances of neurological deterioration are at their highest.
"But it remains highly likely that there will be major functional  after-effects.
He added there is also the risk of complications arising from the coma --  an infection and/or breathing difficulties.
Wendlinger's family and fiancee, along with members of his Sauber-Mercedes  team, have been taking turns to stay at the driver's bedside.
The Austrian crashed during a practice session for Sunday's Monaco Grand  Prix, two weeks after Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger were killed in  accidents at the San Marino Grand Prix.
