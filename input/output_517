Ugandans living on the shores of Lake Victoria  have embarked on a major grave digging effort to bury thousands of corpses  that continue to flow into the lake from Rwanda though the River Kagera.
Health officials warned Saturday that unless the mass burials were  expedited, expidemics could break out, especialy in the western districts of  Masaka and Rakai, where mutilated, decomposing bodies continue to flood in  from the ethnic massacres in neighbouring Rwanda.
Ugandan villagers have buried an estimated 26,000 bodies recovered from  the lake during the past three weeks, said Emmanuel Pinto, a member of  parliament from western Uganda.
But many other bodies were buried before the government established a task  force to deal with the corpse problem, Pinto added.
The official New Vision newspaper reported on Friday that bodies were  arriving at the rate of 1,600 daily.
There are plans to start recovering the bodies from the river before they  flow into the lake.
The UN World Health Organisation has supplied villagers with grave digging  tools to speed up the macabre exercise.
Rwanda plunged into civil war pitting minority Tutsis in the Rwandan  Patriotic Front against the Hutu-dominated army and pro-government militias  after Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in suspicious plane crash  on April 6.
Children and women were clubbed or hacked to death with machetes as  militiamen giggled at their agony, according to witnesses.
The death toll has topped 200,000 in little more than a month of the  ethnic carnage. Some estimates have put the figure much higher.
An estimated half a million other Rwandans have fled to neighbouring  countries.
