Hanoi's anti-drugs police chief has been sentenced  to four years jail by a local tribunal after one of Vietnam's biggest  corruption cases, a legal source said Monday.
Captain Pham Xuan Lien, son of first deputy Interior Minister Pham Tam  Long, will be sent to a prison farm, the source said.
Le Van Luu, head of the police economics section who was charged with  covering up for Lien, was sentenced to three years.
Seven other officers implicated in the affair were jailed for up to 42  months at the end of the four-day trial.
All were charged with "abusing their powers to extort money." They were  said to have altered police reports and falsified documents to cover up a  car-smuggling operation by two Vietnamese along the border with China.
