Blue-chip stocks slipped early Thursday under  pressure from rising bond rates boosted by good US economic news of a sharply  narrower trade deficit and fewer unemployment claims.
The Dow Jones index of 30 leading industrials was down 1.23 point at  3,731.66 several minutes after the session opened on the New York Stock  Exchange.
Wednesday the Dow gained 12.28 points to finish at 3,732.89.
Interest rates on the main 30-year Treasury bond averaged 7.30 percent, up  from 7.27 percent late Wednesday.
The long rates rose after the government reported that the US trade  deficit shrank a surprising 18.5 percent in March to 7.46 billion dollars and  that initial claims for US unemployment benefits last week fell by 14,000.
A trader with CS First Boston said profit taking after two straight days  of advances could also depress the stock market.
