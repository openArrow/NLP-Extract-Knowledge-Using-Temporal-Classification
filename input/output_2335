Thai police said Friday they were investigating  the cause of a fire at a five-star Bangkok hotel that caused hundreds of  guests and employees to flee into the night.
The fire broke out Thursday evening in an office on the third floor of the  Ambassador Hotel and was extinguished 30 minutes later, a police official said.
No one was reported injured and damage was limited to the room where the  fire began, a hotel spokeswoman said.
