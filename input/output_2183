US-Japan trade talks to try to break a  three-month deadlock in bi-lateral trade talks will go into a second day  Friday a US trade official said Thursday.
"They will continue discussing this evening and into tomorrow" a  spokeswoman for the US Trade Representative Office said.
She said the exploratory talks were being pursued "diligently" but would  not indicate whether they had made any progress.
The talks had originally been scheduled to last only one day.
This week's talks are aimed at reaching agreement to resume talks on  opening Japan's markets and reducing its 60-billion-dollar trade surplus with  the United States which broke down in February.
The two sides met for three hours early Thursday but then broke for five  hours.
A Japanese official said the break was to allow the US side to hold  internal discussions.
