A large explosion, believed to have been  caused by a missile fired by northern Yemen forces, rocked Aden early Sunday  morning, military sources said.
The sources said the blast, which struck around 12:30 a.m. (0030 GMT), was  probably caused by a Scud missile.
There were no immediate reports on the location and effect of the blast,  or of any casualties.
Northern forces fired two Scud missiles overnight Thursday at the city,  the power base of the southern command.
The explosion came two hours after a five-man presidential council was  officially named to head the southern independent state proclaimed overnight  Friday by Yemeni Socialist Party leader Ali Salem al-Baid.
The north and south have been embroiled in a civil war since May 4.
