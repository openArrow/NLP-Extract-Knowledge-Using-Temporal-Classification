Nick Price completed an extraordinary  fightback to snatch the Southwestern Bell Colonial title here on Monday,  finally killing off Scott Simpson in a sudden-death play-off.
The Zimbabwean birdied the first hole with a ten-foot putt to win the  rain-blighted tournament.
Price, seven strokes off the pace going into the final round, hit a 64  over two days to keep his hopes alive while Simpson could only manage an  even-par 71 to tie on a 14-under-par total of 266.
Hale Irwin finished with a 65 and one stroke back at 13 under, after  missing a eight-footer at the 16th and seeing his long-range effort on the  18th green stop an agonising inch short.
Play had been halted on Sunday by thunderstorms, leaving Simpson on 14  under on the 12th green, one shot ahead of Irwin on 13 under and Price a  further shot behind.
