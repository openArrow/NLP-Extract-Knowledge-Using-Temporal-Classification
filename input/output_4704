"I am eager to understand truly and accurately your condition, to enter  into and share your worries and your fears and to search together for the  surest path out of our 75-year quagmire."
"My heart longs for the day when our country's long suffering people  might finally find a ray of light," he said.
On his first stop in Magadan, Solzhenitzyn, who lived the life of a  recluse in the US state of Vermont for 18 years, was welcomed home by Nikolai  Kartenko, the mayor of Magadan and by girls bearing the traditional welcome of  bread, salt and flowers.
He twice stooped to touch his native soil there, saying his gesture was in  tribute to the "hundreds of thousands, even millions" of people who died in  the Siberian camps for which the town served as a processing center during the  Soviet era.
"According to ancient Christian tradition, the land where innocent martyrs  are buried becomes a holy land, and for that it shall be honoured," he said.
"These victims today are easily forgotten, both by those who have not been  affected by the destruction and by those who carried out that destruction. The  roots of our self-destruction come from there."
Solzhenitsyn, who stayed only about 15 minutes in Magadan, also spoke  briefly with former labour camp prisoners who still live there.
Before leaving Anchorage, Solzhenitsyn said that he planned to take "an  active part in the social life of Russia. And as my voice will be heard, I  would like to have some influence on Russia's health."
Solzhenitsyn went to the United States in 1976 after spending two years in  Europe, eventually settling in rural Vermont.
Solzhenitsyn was arrested in 1945 after making derogatory remarks about  Stalin in a letter and was sentenced to eight years in forced labour camps,  followed by internal exile.
His novels "One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich", "Cancer Ward" and  "The First Circle" were hailed as epic works that exposed Soviet terror to the  world.
