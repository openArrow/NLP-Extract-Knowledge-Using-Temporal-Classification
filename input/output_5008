The first-time entries reflect the growing international flavor here. They  include Canada's Jacques Villeneuve, the fastest rookie ever here; Japan's  Hideshi Matsuda, who was a television commentator here the past two years;  Mexico's Adrian Fernandez plus Brazil's Marco Greco and Mauricio Gugelmin. All  seek to prove themselves and become the idols to the first young racers of the  21st century.
"You always go through periods dealing with different characters,"  Andretti said. "I'm sure as a youngster I didn't suit the old guard in those  days. Nothing has changed. It's just that old things are happening to new  people."
"You can't make new stars overnight," Mansell said. "It takes eight to 10  years."
Safety improvements have allowed racers the chance at longer careers.  Money is also a big factor. The famous names have been able to attract  financial support tomeet the growing expenses of their sport.
Newcomers often have a tougher time finding money than proving their  skills. France's Stephan Gregoire qualified here last year with the backing of  the French government. But he said his funding fell through last month because  he was driving in a US race instead of in Formula One.
"I looked for a ride for a month, but I could not get anything without any  money," Gregoire said. "I finally worked out something with Dick Simon, but it  was not enough. You need at least five or six days here to get up to speed.  It's difficult."
That's one reason why Andretti's last ride here brings a finality to an  era.
"There's a touch of sadness, but I'm prepared for it and comfortable with  it," he said. "I made the decision. To stay longer would bring a degree of  sadness I don't need. I don't want to be a load. If I do better than expected,  I'll want to squeeze out another year. But I'll try to fight these urges off."
