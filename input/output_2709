Republic of Ireland manager Jack Charlton is  banking on his golden oldies for the World Cup finals -- with a squad boasting  an astonishing 648 caps!.
That figure is even more remarkable, considering four of the USA party,  Jason McAteer (Bolton), Phil Babb (Coventry), Gary Kelly (Leeds United) and  Alan Kelly (Sheffield United), have only two caps each.
Charlton said on Saturday the players involved in Tuesday's game against  Bolivia in Dublin, and then against World Cup holders Germany in Hanover on  May 29, would be on duty in America.
But Charlton added: "I can still make alterations to the squad right up  until June 3, the date our list of players must be forwarded to FIFA."
Full-back Kelly, 19, is the youngest member of the squad. The oldest is  Blackburn defender Kevin Moran, who was 38 last month.
The most capped individual is goalkeeper Pat Bonner, handed a free  transfer by Celtic last week.
If he plays against Bolivia on Tuesday, he will equal Liam Brady's Irish  record of 72 international caps.
There is no place in the squad for Leeds' former Republic captain David  O'Leary, 36, who scored the shoot-out penalty against Romania that put his  country into the 1990 World Cup quarter final in Italy.
Squad: Goalkeepers; Bonner (Celtic) 71 caps, A Kelly (Sheffield Utd) 2.  Defenders; G Kelly (Leeds Utd) 2, Irwin (Man Utd) 24, McGrath (Aston Villa)  63, Babb (Coventry) 2, Kernaghan (Man City) 9, Moran (Blackburn) 70, Phelan  (Man City) 19.

Forwards; Aldridge (Tranmere) 56, Cascarino (Chelsea) 47,  Coyne (Motherwell) 11, D Kelly (Wolves) 15.
