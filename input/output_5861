Currencies showed little movement on the European  foreign exchange markets Tuesday, as dealers appeared ready to wait for  Friday's unemployment figures in the United States.
After a three-day break because of public holidays in Britain and the  United States, the dollar closed here at 1.6440 marks, the same level as  Friday.
"The market is waiting to see what US traders will do with Friday's  figures," said Peter Wood, a trader at the Bank of Boston.
"At the moment, dealers are selling the dollar each time any encouraging  news pushes it up. Unless there is concerted central bank intervention, it  will fall to around 1.62 to 1.63 marks in the next few days," said Wood.
Against the European currencies, the mark remained stable. At 1600 GMT, it  was worth 3.4170 French francs and 968.35 lire.
The escudo remained weak at 103.81 to the mark against 104.10.
At 1600 GMT, the dollar was trading at 104.65 yen from 104.40, at 1.4015  Swiss francs from 1.4035 and at 5.6163 French francs from 5.6213.
The pound was trading at 1.5115 dollars from 1.5090, at 2.4849 marks from  2.4808, at 158.18 yen from 157.54, at 2.1184 Swiss francs from 2.1179 and at  8.4890 French francs from 8.4825.
Gold was up at 387.25 dollars an ounce, compared to 384.90 and the  three-month euro-dollar was stable at 4.5625 percent.
The three-month British inter-bank rate was 5.1875 percent, compared to  5.125 percent.
