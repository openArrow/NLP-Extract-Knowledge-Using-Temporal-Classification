Australia will need to increase immigration to  counter declining population growth in the next century, according to an  official report released here Monday.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics projects the population will grow to  between 24.9 million and 26.7 million by 2041, compared to 17.7 million last  year, depending on immigration and fertility rates.
But the report says the growth rate is expected to fall from its current  level of about one percent annually to between 0.3 percent and 0.6 percent in  2041.
Growth rates below one percent have not been experienced in Australia  since the early 1940s.
"The lowest rates recorded this century were about 0.7 to 0.8 percent in  the depression years of the early 1930s," the report said.
The population projections assume gains from overseas migration will  remain steady.
In such circumstances and in the absence of a rise in fertility rates,  migration will contribute more to population growth than natural increase.
If it is assumed there is no net gain from overseas migration, the report  says the growth rate would be even slower, and the population would begin to  decline after peaking at 20.5 million in 2032.
