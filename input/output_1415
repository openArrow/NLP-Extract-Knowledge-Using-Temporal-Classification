The US Federal Reserve raised two key interest  rates Tuesday, saying it was acting to keep inflation down and support US  economic growth.
The US central bank raised the overnight interbank rate half a percentage  point from 3.75 percent to 4.25 percent and its discount rate from 3.0 to 3.5  percent.
It was the fourth rise in the overnight rate for loans between commercial  banks since February, but the first for the discount rate -- the interest the  Fed charges for direct loans to banks -- in five years.
The Fed said the move was "designed to maintain the favorable trend in  inflation and thereby sustain the economic expansion."
"As always, the Fed will continue to monitor economic and financial  developments to judge the appropriate stance of monetary policy," the Fed said  in a statement after a meeting of its Open Market Committee which sets US  monetary policy.
The meeting had been widely expected to raise short-term rates.
