Loris Capirossi, riding a Honda, shook  off fellow Italian Massimiliano Biaggi, on an Aprilia, on the last lap of the  250cc race to win Austrian motorcycle Grand Prix here Sunday.
Biaggi, winner of the Australian and Malaysian Grands Prix, had lost the  lead six laps from the finish but fought his way back in front on the last lap  before Capirossi attacked again.
Biaggi braked too hard on the last big curve and Capirossi was able to  slip inside and hang on to win by half a second.
Doriano Romboni of Italy, on a Honda, won the three-man race for third  place.
Tadayuki Okada of Japan, on a Yamaha, finished fourth to maintain his  world championship lead on 85 points.
Capirossi's first win this season took him to third in the championship on  77 points behind Biaggi on 83.
"I braked too hard and I slid and then the bike jumped once or twice so I  couldn't hold him off. I'm very unhappy after doing all the work," said Biaggi.
"It was a very difficult race. I took my chances," said Capirossi who put  in the fastest lap of the race at an average 117mph (188kmh) six laps from the  finish to set up the exciting finish.
