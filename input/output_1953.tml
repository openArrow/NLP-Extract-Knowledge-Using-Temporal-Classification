More than 50 people <EVENT eid="e3" class="ASPECTUAL" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">began</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">examining</EVENT> case studies of East Asian "Tiger"  economies -- and their younger "cubs" in Southeast Asia region -- during a  <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION">two-day</TIMEX3> conference <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PASTPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">organized</EVENT> by the World Bank and the UN Economic and Social  Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).&#13;
<EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">Divining</EVENT> the elements of East Asian business success has been a successful  business in itself, with experts often disagreeing, admits Callisto Madavo,  the World Bank's East Asia and Pacific director.&#13;
"There's no point in <EVENT eid="e7" class="REPORTING" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">citing</EVENT> a single 'magic bullet' because I don't <EVENT eid="e8" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="NEG" modality="none">think</EVENT>  there is one," he <EVENT eid="e9" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT>.&#13;
But ESCAP and the World Bank hope "policy-makers will have some new ideas  to <EVENT eid="e10" class="I_STATE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">consider</EVENT> when they go home," <EVENT eid="e11" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT> ESCAP executive secretary Rafeeuddin  Ahmed.&#13;
The promise of <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">leaning</EVENT> something valuable has <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">drawn</EVENT> emisaries from the  high-powered, like Hong Kong, to those with high potential, like China, to the  subdued and isolated like Burma.&#13;
Delegates from nearly 20 countries <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">sifted</EVENT> through World Bank studies that  <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">highlighted</EVENT> three qualities shared by East Asian economies. Eight of these  economies have been the among the 12 fastest <EVENT eid="e16" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">growing</EVENT> in the world since <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DATE">1960</TIMEX3>.&#13;
The three qualities they shared are:&#13;
-- Stable and enforced macroeconomic policies that were "conducive to  investment and enterprise."&#13;
-- Powerful incentives to <EVENT eid="e17" class="I_ACTION" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">encourage</EVENT> efficient use of resources, rather  than mad-grab consumption.&#13;
-- "A dynamic engine of growth to <EVENT eid="e18" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">provide</EVENT> leadership for development."&#13;
The last point is flexibly <EVENT eid="e19" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">defined</EVENT>, what Ahmed <EVENT eid="e20" class="I_ACTION" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">calls</EVENT> an "intangible."&#13;
But a World Bank advisory suggests undeveloped economies can <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="can">fuel</EVENT> an  "engine of <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">growth</EVENT>" by following certain guidelines, including <EVENT eid="e23" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">spreading</EVENT> <EVENT eid="e24" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">growth</EVENT>  and income, <EVENT eid="e25" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">investing</EVENT> in education, and <EVENT eid="e26" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">finding</EVENT> a national consensus on  economic goals.&#13;
