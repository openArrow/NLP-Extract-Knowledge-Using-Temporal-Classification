The Indian capital wilted under a blazing sun on  Monday as the hottest day in 50 years brought life to a standstill.
The meteorological office here said the 46 degrees Celsius (114.8 degrees  Fahrenheit) recorded in the afternoon was the highest temperature since 1944.
It warned that the temperatures could rise due to summer winds blowing in  from Pakistan.
Residents in this city of some eight million largely stayed indoors amid  power cuts and water shortages. Connaught Place, the main shopping center in  central Delhi, was virtually deserted.
At least 70 people have died in the heatwave gripping northern India,  according to official figures.
Pavement vendors and kiosk owners closed up shop here in the afternoon  while ice cream and soda pop sellers did brisk business.
