European Cup Winners Cup holders Arsenal were at  the centre of a double transfer riddle on Friday.
The English Premiership club have been linked with Benfica's  Ukrainian-born striker Sergei Yuran and England Under-21 international Scott  Minto, who is out of contract with London First Division club Charlton  Athletic.
A Portuguese television report claimed the Gunners were about to sign  Russian international Yuran, who is in trouble at Benfica after refusing to  sit on the substitutes' bench in a league match.
But Arsenal managing director Ken Friar said: "There is no truth in the  rumour that we are involved in contract negotiations with that particular  player."
Highbury manager George Graham has already spent two million pounds on  Benfica's Swedish international midfielder Stefan Schwarz.
Minto, 22, was reported to have signed for Chelsea in a 2.3 million deal,  but he is now said to be having talks with Arsenal.
