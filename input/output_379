Following the lead set by interest rates, share  prices on Wall Street bounced around this past week before closing Friday on a  down note as traders awaited the Federal Reserve's next move.
The Dow Jones index of 30 blue chips closed down 9.82 points (0.27  percent) Friday at 3,659.68.
Share prices started the week by dropping 40 points as bond rates rose to  their highest point since November 1992 after the Federal Reserve dashed  expectations that it would raise interest rates.
This intervention had been expected following the release on May 6 of  figures showing employment figures were better than expected.
Quarterly Treasury auctions on Tuesday and Wednesday and the release of  excellent inflation figures on Thursday convinced traders that the Fed would  step in on Tuesday after its Open Market meeting at which monetary policy is  decided.
Interest rates were again pushed higher by the disappointing results of an  auction of 10-year bonds, but they slid lower after the good inflation figures  were released.
While economic figures have reassured traders, most are still expecting  interest rates to rise, said Ed La Varnway, an analyst with First Albany.
It is difficult to predict how the markets will react to the Fed's  intervention, but traders have been expecting it for so long that they would  prefer the Fed to just raise rates "once and for all," said La Varnway.
They are expecting a one-half point increase in the rate that banks charge  each other to four percent and a similar rise in the discount rate to 3.5  percent.
"If the Fed keeps fiddling around with 25 basis point increases, it will  keep the markets on edge," said Hildegard Zagorski, an analyst with Prudential  Securities.
