South African rugby union was in a state of  upheaval on Sunday, less than two weeks before the first Test between South  Africa and the touring England side.
Press reports suggest the seven-man rugby selection panel may be axed in  the week before the June 11 second Test and Springbok coach Ian McIntosh will  be sacked if South Africa lose the first on June 4.
In a front page report, Afrikaans-language Rapport newspaper said South  African Rugby Football Union (SARFU) president Louis Luyt wanted to sack the  selection panel and had warned McIntosh his future was on the line.
It claimed it was still uncertain at this late stage who would captain the  Springboks in the first Test at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria.
Luyt said he was on the warpath after a series of selection bungles,  culminating in the nomination of a staggering 57 players to attend a national  squad training session on Monday.
"It can't go on like this," Luyt said. "We are being held up to ridicule  and I am willing to take action and to take it immediately."
He said he intended calling a special general meeting but because this  required two weeks' notice, it could not be held before the first Test.
Luyt added he wanted the coach, his assistant and one other selector to  pick teams.
"All the members of my executive I have spoken to agree with me that  something should be done," Luyt said. "I don't care if some people are going  to dislike me. It's for South Africa and I don't intend to do things by half  measures.
"By now we should have had a squad of 21 or 22 but with two weeks to go it  seems as if the selectors don't know what they're doing," Luyt said.
"I don't care if they pick 15 Western Province boys but I want to see some  planning and I want to see some consistency."
Luyt said that if his proposal was carried, the new three-man committee  would pick the team due to leave for New Zealand on June 19.
