American lawmakers voted against a US invasion  of Haiti but backed the use of a tiny Haitian island as a base for exiled  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
The non-binding resolution, adopted 223-201 by the House of  Representatives, comes as tension is rising in Haitian waters.
A US warship fired warning shots at ships suspected of smuggling in  violation of the UN embargo on Port-au-Prince.
The measure, sponsored by Florida Republican Porter Goss as an amendment  to a defense bill, opposed the use of US military force to restore Haiti's  democracy unless there is a "clear and present danger to US interests or  citizens."
It also supported the use of Isle de la Gonave off the Haitian mainland as  a US asylum request screening center and a base of operation for Aristide, who  has lived in Washington for more than two years.
The Haitian army presence on the island is minimal.
"The Goss amendment puts the House on record," said Republican Benjamin  Gilman of New York. "It should be on record in recognizing other options  (than) the use of military force.
President Bill Clinton has said he would not rule out the use of force if  Haiti's army rulers do not step aside and allow the reinstatement of Aristide,  his country's first democratically elected president, toppled in a September  1991 military coup.
