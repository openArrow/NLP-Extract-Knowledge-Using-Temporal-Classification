Brazil has signed the Tlatelolco Treaty  banning nuclear weapons from Latin America, the Mexican foreign ministry said.
"Brazil's adherence to the Tlatelolco Treaty asserts the importance of  that pioneer legal instrument that had the honor of establishing the first  nuclear-free zone in a densely populated region," comprising 450 million  people, Foreign Minister, Manuel Tello, said after the ceremony Monday.
As to Cuba, the only Latin American nation that has not joined Tlatelolco,  Tello said statements from Havana gave reason to hope that the treaty will  cover 100 percent of its adscribed ares "in the near future."
