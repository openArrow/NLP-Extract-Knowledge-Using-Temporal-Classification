Indian army troops with orders to shoot rioters  on sight took positions Saturday after a burst of ethnic violence left at  least 17 people dead and many injured in the northeastern frontier state of  Assam.
The army joined police and paramilitary reinforcements in the riot-hit  district of Kokrajhar, where fighting between Bodo tribespeople and Assamese  natives broke out late Friday, the Press Trust of India (PTI) said.
The riots engulfed 10 villages in the Kokrajhar countryside as Bodos --  among whom a militant group is fighting for a tribal homeland to be carved out  of Assam -- went on the rampage setting non-Bodo homes and property on fire.
"Some of the villages were burning throughout the night," PTI quoted  official sources in Guwahati as saying.
At least 17 people were killed, many injured and 500 left homeless, it  said. The agency had earlier reported that hundreds were injured.
Most victims were reported to be non-tribal natives of Assam, an oil- and  mineral-rich state of 22 million bordering Bangladesh hit by periodic  outbreaks of ethnic trouble.
Saikia blamed factional fighting within the Bodo tribal movement for the  riots, saying opponents of Bodo leader Prem Singh Brahma had provoked the  attacks against non-tribals.
A rumour that representatives of the militant All Bodo Students Union,  apparently opposed to Brahma, had not been called for peace talks to settle  the Bodo problem sparked off the riots, he said.
The rioting was also linked to Bodo demands that non-tribal settlers leave  Bodo-dominated villages in Kokrajhar, where 50 people were killed in ethnic  violence last October, PTI said.
Saikia announced a compensation of 100,000 rupees (3,330 dollars) for  families of each of the dead. He ordered district authorities to set up relief  camps to shelter residents whose homes had been destroyed.
Assam is also the site of an insurgency led by Assamese extremists  fighting for secession from India.
