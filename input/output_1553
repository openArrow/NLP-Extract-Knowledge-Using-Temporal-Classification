Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans cast  doubt Wednesday on the size of a planned UN peacekeeping force in  violence-torn Rwanda and refused to commit his country's troops immediately.
Evans said Australia would not send its soldiers as part of a UN force  until the international body defined a workable plan with sufficient resources  to carry it out.
The UN Security Council voted in New York Tuesday to increase the UN  military strength in Rwanda from 400 to 5,500 and slap an arms embargo on the  central African nation, but Evans said a much greater force might be needed.
"We are not going to be quick to respond to the Security Council  resolution until we are confident that a workable operational mandate has been  defined and that the resources will be there to enable the job to be done,"  Evans said.
The minister, who has previously called on the international community to  stop the slaughter in Rwanda, said it was unclear whether sufficient forces  were being deployed.
"Five thousand five hundred troops is not very many when you have not yet  got a peace to keep, when you are mounting what is in effect a nationwide,  full-scale policing operation to stop a lot of random violence as well as to  keep apart two warring armies," he said.
High-ranking government officials met here to discuss a UN request for  Australia to contribute either a communications squadron, helicopters, a field  engineering squadron or a movement control unit.
Officials said a potential Australian force could number up to 300 troops.  No decision is likely before next week, when senior members of the government  will decide on Australia's involvement.
