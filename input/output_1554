A court on Tuesday jailed for 11 months the  73-year-old ex-chairman of the Bank Leumi, Israel's leading bank, for criminal  involvement in a 1983 share crash.
Ernst Japhet was found guilty of manipulating shares and falsifying  financial reports in the scandal which saw Israel's top banks artificially  force up their own stock market prices.
When the bubble burst the government finally intervened and bought up the  shares to save the country from ruin, at a cost of seven billion dollars.
Japhet was also given a two-year suspended sentence and fined 300,000  dollars.
His lawyer announced an appeal.
Israel four major banks and nine top executives were found guilty on  similar charges last February and jailed last month.
