The outlawed militant Islamic group the Jamaa  Islamiyya has urged young people to join the holy war to topple President  Hosni Mubarak's secular government.
The appeal for jihad, or holy war, was made in a statement distributed  after prayers marking Saturday's Moslem feast of Al-Adha in the southern  Egyptian provinces of Beni Suef, Minia and Asyut.
A high police presence in Asyut meant the statement was not as widely  distributed.
"You young people of Islam, what are you waiting for to join the march of  the jihad, which will never cease," the leaflet asked.
"The blood (of Islamists) is still flowing in prisons," it added referring  to the death of the "martyr" Abdel Hareth Madani, an Islamic defence lawyer  who died in police custody.
Initial autopsy reports said he had died from being tortured, but a later  statement from the interior ministry said he had suffered an asthma attack.
The Jamaa has waged a two-year campaign to overthrow the government in  which nearly 400 people have been killed.
The Jamaa also denounced the Israel-PLO autonomy accord which launched  Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho.
In another statement it said the accord signed on May 4 in Cairo aimed to  "wipe out the Islamic movement and give up the Al-Aqsa mosque" in Jerusalem,  one of the holiest sites in Islam.
The Moslem Brotherhood, tolerated as a religious organisation, also  denounced the self-rule deal accusing PLO Yasser Arafat of giving in while  praising the radical HAMAS movement, saying "as long as people fight back,  there is hope."
