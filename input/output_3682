Anna Smashnova, the junior champion here in 1991,  moved into the big league when she dumped 5th seed Jana Novotna out of the  French Open here on Tuesday.
The Russian-born Israeli was always on top of last year's Wimbledon  finalist as she raced to a 6-4, 6-2 win that was the biggest of her career.
In the second round she faces American Shaun Stafford, who beat her  earlier this year in Sydney.
Smashnova, who emigrated to Israel in 1990, said: "I feel good. I played  the right game to beat Jana and this was the biggest win of my career by a  long, long way.
"The best person I had beaten previously was ranked in the fifties."
Novotna, whose service was restricted by an arm injury, admitted: "I'm  devastated. I've had a good season so far on clay and I never expected to lose  in the first round.
"I had never even seen Smashnova playing before today. But she just kept  hitting the ball back and I kept missing."
