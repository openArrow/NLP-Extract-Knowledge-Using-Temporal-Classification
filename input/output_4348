Zairean President Mobutu sese Seko has  recommended the immediate demilitarisation of the Rwandan capital of Kigali,  the Zairois Press Agency AZAP said Thursday.
"It is vital to declare Kigali and an area up to 20 kilometres around the  town neutral," the Zairean president said.
Mobutu said this would allow "the intervention of United Nations forces,  emergency services of humanitarian organisations, as well as the setting up of  a government of national union following talks between the two parties to the  conflict."
Zaire, along with Burundi, Uganda and Tanzania, borders the tiny east  African nation where up to half a million people have been killed in fighting  between the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis since early April.
