Russia retargeted Monday its missiles away from the  United States and Britain in line with agreements signed earlier this year  with the two countries, the commander of Russian strategic rocket troops said.
General Igor Sergeyev was quoted by Iterfax as saying that the nuclear  weapons were "de-targeted" and would not be aimed at any place on earth.
He added that the move would increase nuclear safety and would prevent an  unauthorised launch as the strategic missiles would not take off without a  flight program.
US President Bill Clinton signed the agreement on retargeting the missiles  with Russian President Boris Yeltsin during a summit meeting in January.
Britain joined the agreement in February.
