Japan's Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. announced Friday  a pre-tax loss of 28.1 billion yen (273 million dollars) for the year to  March, reversing a profit of 139 million yen a year earlier.
The manufacturer of Subaru cars and aircaft and transport equipment said  it expected to return to the black in the current year with a pre-tax profit  of three billion yen although it would continue to withhold dividends.
In the year just ended, Fuji said sales dropped 12.5 percent to 764  billion yen, depressed by weak sales of four-wheel drive vehicles abroad.
Subaru exports plunged 43 percent to 102,932 units during the year while  domestic sales were also down, albeit less sharply with sales dropping by less  than two percent to 311,199 units.
