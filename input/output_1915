Most Japanese business leaders believe Japan's  economic growth in real terms will average at least two percent through to the  end of the century, according to a survey published Thursday.
The Mainichi newspaper said that in its survey of 50 company presidents,  conducted from late April to mid-May, 32 expected a two percent-level growth,  compared with 14 forecasting a three percent-level. Three presidents predicted  zero percent or one percent growth.
The survey found that more than 30 predicted information and  telecommunications would be the next leading industry in Japan's economy, the  national daily said.
