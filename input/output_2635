Aden authorities proclaimed early Saturday an  independent state in South Yemen, 16 days after becoming embroiled in a civil  war with northern government forces.
Announcing the secession from the north after one of the bloodiest days of  fighting since the conflict began, the south's leader Ali Salem al-Baid said  in a televised address: "I proclaim the creation of the Yemeni Democratic  Republic as an independent state with its capital in Aden."
The declaration came just a day before the fourth anniversary of the  unification of North and South Yemen and hours after the north called a  three-day ceasefire.
The two sides, locked in a political crisis since August (eds:correct)  1993, have been at war since May 4.
Al-Baid said the decision to break away resulted from attempts by his  bitter northern rival, President Ali Abdallah Saleh, to "destroy the south" by  means of war, and his refusal to countenance dialogue on the basis of a  bilateral reconciliation document signed February 20 in Amman.
He said the new state, which he called on "friendly" countries to  recognise in line with international norms, would be governed by the same  constitution as that in force in the north.
It would base its legislative system on Islamic Sharia law, he added.
He also announced the formation of a council of national salvation  comprising elected southern deputies, representatives of political parties and  religious figures, which will choose a presidential council and an interim  government, adding that multi-party elections would be held within a year.
Al-Baid, Saleh's sacked vice president and the leader of South Yemen prior  to unification, said the new state was committed to respecting "political and  public freedoms, human rights and freedom of expression and of the press," and  would maintain a liberal economic system.
The announcement prompted spontaneous celebratory gunfire throughout the  southern port city, correspondents said.
It was also backed early Saturday by Abdelrahman Al-Jifri, leader of the  opposition Sons of Yemen movement, who told AFP the union "could not continue  under (the Sanaa) regime," which had sought to control it "by use of force".
Saleh's General People's Congress and Al-Baid's Yemen Socialist Party had  formed a fragile governing coalition after April 1993 elections.
The declaration came after a day of bitter fighting amid increasing  pressure from Arab leaders for an end to hostilities.
Hours earlier the government in Sanaa called a three-day ceasefire as of  Saturday 00:00 a.m. (Friday 2100 GMT), the SABA news agency said.
Northern leaders presented the truce as offering "a last chance to the  (southern) separatists ... to end their rebellion, adhere to the constitution  and place their troops under the command of the head of state" in Sanaa.
Earlier in the day Saleh seemingly ignored appeals from Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak and Palestine Liberation Organisation leader Yasser Arafat to  lay down arms for the Al-Adha feast, which starts Saturday.
But in Mukallah, 700 kilometers (450 miles) east of Aden, Al-Baid ruled  out any form of surrender and vowed "not to give up a single inch of our  territory in the south."
In a radio speech he said Saleh was "trying to get his hands on Aden and  the oil-rich eastern provinces and we are not going to let him have either  Aden or the oil."
A spokesman for the southern forces here said 1,500 northern troops had  been killed Friday in the Kharaz region west of Aden while trying to advance  on the city.
The death toll, which was not confirmed by the north, was the largest  daily loss announced since the fighting broke out.
Earlier Friday northern forces claimed to have made further progress in  advancing on Aden.
The southern army had also retaken control of the key Al-Anad airbase 60  kilometres (35 miles) north of Aden, the spokesman said, although earlier in  the day Sanaa said its forces controlled the airbase.
Despite unification in 1990, the north and south have persisted in  retaining separate security forces, civil services and bureaucracies.
