Blue-chip stocks posted modest gains Friday in a  mixed trading session marked by easing of interest rates eclipsed in part by  weakness in technology stocks.
The Dow Jones index of 30 leading industrials rose 6.84 points to close at  3,659.68.
On the broader market, declining shares slightly outnumbered advancers  1,075 to 1,027 with 677 shares unchanged. Some 252 million shares were traded.
The market got a boost from a drop in yields on 30-year Treasury bonds to  7.49 percent from 7.56 percent Thursday, a sign of declining fears among  investors over inflation and higher interest rates.
The decline in rates came after the government reported consumer prices  rose a modest 0.1 percent in April, which confirmed low inflation following  Thursday's report of a 0.1 percent decline in wholesale prices in April.
Bob Walberg of MMS Internation said the markets had already anticipated a  half-point boost in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
"The markets fear the two inflation reports will lead the Fed to raise  interest rates by only 25 basis points (one-quarter point) instead of 50,"  Walberg said. "The market wants to see a more aggressive move by the Fed  despite the relatively passive inflation numbers."
Fears of a decline in the growth rate of the computer industry caused a  drop in technology stocks. Compaq Computer fell 1-1/8 to 104-3/8, Sears 1-3/8  to 47-3/8 and AMR Corp. 2-1/2 to 53-1/8.
Philip Morris rose 1-5/8 to 52-1/8, Dow Chemical1 to 66-3/8 and J.P.  Morgan 1-1/2 to 63-1/8.
