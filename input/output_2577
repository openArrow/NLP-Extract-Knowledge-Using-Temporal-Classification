In his latest warning on the matter, North Korean President Kim Il-Sung  said that his country would not bow to international pressure over its nuclear  ambitions, saying that "pressure can never be a solution to the problem,"  according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).
Top South Korean officials expressed hope Friday that North Korea's  actions would not push Pyongyang and Washington to the brink.
Foreign Minister Han Sung-Joo was quoted by Korean journalists travelling  with him in Hanoi as saying that despite the start of refueling, chances of  Washington and Pyongyang sitting down together for talks were still "high."
A reporter from Yonhap news agency travelling with Han quoted a  well-informed source as saying the IAEA had "made a judgement call that saved  the two Koreas and the United States from going to the brink."
"The IAEA, instead of immediately charging North Korea with starting the  rod removal, has decided to go for substance," the Yonhap reporter said,  adding that the Washington-Pyongyang talks could start in June.
"The IAEA said North Korea's unloading process was still in an early  stage, and the scope of the inspections the agency wants can still be  achieved," the reporter said.
