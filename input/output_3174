Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev arrived  Monday in Berlin for a short unofficial visit accompanied by a group of  generals, a spokesman for Russian armed forces in Germany said.
Grachev was set to meet representatives from Deutsche Bank to discuss  financial details regarding the withdrawal of Moscow's remaining forces,  ITAR-TASS said. The bank was unavailable for comment.
Grachev was scheduled to leave for Brussels on Tuesday to discuss the  North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's "Partnership for Peace" initiative, which  offers increased cooperation with former Warsaw Pact states but falls short of  full membership of the western military alliance.
Moscow wants to be given a greater status in any relationship with NATO,  reflecting Russia's great power status.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin is also under pressure from conservatives  who are concerned about NATO extending its influence eastwards, which they  believe could harm Russian strategic interests.
To date, 18 former Communist bloc nations have signed up to the  "Partnership for Peace" scheme which they hope will be a prelude to full NATO  membership.
