Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) have completed their inspection of a controversial nuclear  reactor in North Korea and took samples from spent fuel rods, IAEA officials  said in Vienna Wednesday.
The samples should allow the IAEA to determine how long the fuel rods were  in the reactor and thereby calculate whether plutonium could have been  diverted, possibly for use in making nuclear bombs.
