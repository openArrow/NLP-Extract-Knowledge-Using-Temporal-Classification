The United Nations is negotiating with an armed  Somali gang to secure the release of a wounded Nepalese peacekeeper abducted  during an ambush in which five Nepalese troops were killed, a UN spokesman  said Wednesday.
The soldier was kidnapped from his bed in Mogadishu's squalid bomb-scarred  Digfer hospital, which UN officials last year classified as a base for the  militia of warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid, spokesman George Bennett said.
He was the first UN soldier to be taken to Digfer rather than to a UN  hospital.
Bennett said he had been taken there by Somalis after the shootout Monday.  Hospital officials contacted the International Committee of the Red Cross who  sent field workers to see him, but he was abducted before they arrived.
Red Cross officials visited him in captivity Monday evening. "His wounds  are not life-threatening," Bennett said by telephone from Mogadishu.
Asked whether a ransom had been demanded, Bennett said: "We are not giving  any details. We are in contact with the abductors and we're doing all we can  to effect his release but things are at a delicate stage."
