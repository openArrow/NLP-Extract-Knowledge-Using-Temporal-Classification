Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Saleh has appointed  new ministers of oil and transport in a further bid to isolate supporters of  his southern rival Ali Salem al-Baid.
Saleh appointed Faisal Uthman ibn Shamlan, a southerner, as minister of  petroleum and minerals on Thursday, the official news agency SABA said
He replaces Saleh Abubakr ibn Hussainoun, a supporter of Yemen Socialist  Party (YSP) leader Baid, who has declared a breakaway southern state.
Ahmed Musaid Hussain was appointed transport minister.
Saleh named Abdelkader Abdelrahman Bajamal from the southern port city of  Aden as deputy prime minister.
The president also appointed new governors in the eastern oil region of  Shabwa and in Lahej, a province just north of Aden. Both areas have been  bitterly contested by northern and southern troops.
Ahmed Ali Mohsin was appointed governor of Shabwa and Abdallah Awad  Bahmatraf governor of Lahej.
Saba also reported that the families of several prominent supporters of  Baid had arrived in DJibouti.
