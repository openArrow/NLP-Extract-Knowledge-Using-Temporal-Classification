Angola is threatened by severe famine due to a  grave food supply situation, the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO)  said in a statement released here on Friday.
"Deaths from starvation-related causes were reported from several parts of  the country and severe cases of malnutrition were observed in areas visited by  a recent FAO/World Food Programme (WFP) mission", the FAO said.
According to FAO, large numbers of Angolans have totally become dependent  on food aid due to a severe dislocation of the economy and the collapse of the  grain market due to years of intensive civil war.
But the food supply outlook for 1994 was extremely bleak due to a sharp  reduction in the output of cereals and cassava, rendering the country  seriously threatened by widespread famine "unless arrangements for large-scale  food assistance are made to feed the affected population", the FAO warned.
Angola faces a food deficit of 1.4 million tonnes in 1994/95, 60 percent  of which is due to reduced production of cassava which is being harvest about  six to nine months before maturity to compensate for the shortfall in maize  production, the recent FAO/WFP mission to Angola found out.
The mission recommended an increase in per capita cereal food-use  allowance to compensate for the large shortfall in cassava availability, and  new efforts to promote production of second season beans and vegetable crops  and to rehabilitate maize production, which has dipped from one million tonnes  20 years ago to 200,000 tonnes.
The mission estimated Angola's cereal import requirements for 1994/95 at  560,000 tonnes, of which 100,000 tonnes would be imported commercially and the  of 460,000 tonnes would require food aid.
With 103,000 tonnes of food aid already in the pipeline, and 20,000 tonnes  of food still in stock at the end of March 1994, leaves Angola with a net food  aid requirement of 337,000 tonnes in 1994/95, it said.
The emergency food aid for an estimated target population of 2.2 million  in Angola is estimated at 260,000 tonnes, leaving a programme food aid  requirement of 77,000 tonnes, while another 167,000 children would also need  supplementary feeding of about 8,000 tonnes, the FAO added.
