The Polish government and the London Club of  private creditors agreed on how a debt-reduction plan should be enacted at a  weekend meeting, the chief Polish negotiator Krzysztof Krowacki said on Monday.
Poland owes the private creditors 13.2 billion dollars. In March the two  sides had agreed a plan to reduce the debt.
The price for the repurchase of the debt was set at 41 cents in the dollar  concerning the principal and unpaid interest and at 38 cents in the dollar  concerning revolving credits, Krowacki said, the Polish PAP news agency  reported.
The Polish government had also drafted a "preliminary proposal" to convert  debt in exchange for creditor participation in the performance of the Polish  economy.
This arrangement between Poland and the Club of London "is final and we  shall have nothing else to put forward" to creditor banks, he said.
The banks would have until June 29 in which to give their reply and open  the way for the signature of specific agreements.
The agreement reached between the two sides in March, after four years of  negotiations, had resulted in a reduction of about 45 percent of the debt.  Repayment is to be spread over 30 years until 2024 and will not exceed 400  million dollars per year.
