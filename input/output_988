A passenger train carrying more  than 400 people hit a loose truck trailer and jumped its tracks before dawn  Monday, killing one person and seriously injuring four people, authorities  said.
More than 170 other people suffered lesser injuries in the collision,  which ocurred about 40 miles (65 kilometers) north of Fayetteville, North  Carolina at 4:32 a.m. (0832 GMT), Amtrak spokeswoman Pat Kelly said in  Washington.
Authorities said the Amtrak Silver Meteor, which was bound for Florida  from New York, hit a big-rig truck trailer that fell off a CSX freight train.  The trailer was loaded with cat box filler.
The lead engine jumped the tracks and slid down a ravine, derailing 12 of  the passenger train's 13 cars. Earlier, authorities said the passenger train  collided with the freight train.
The person killed was in an engine car, said Richard Self, Johnston County  manager. Many of the injured were in the first passenger car, which flipped  over on its side.
"I was thrown out of my bunk and I landed on both of my children,"  passenger Sue McGrath told a local television station. "The car was laying  over sideways."
Dick Hutchinson described the impact as "a bump and then three short  bumps. Everybody stayed relatively calm. It was terrifying."
A sheriff's deputy said they first became aware of the derailment when  they saw people streaming through the woods.
"We started checking cars. That's when we found people with broken legs  and lacerations. People were sitting on top of one car and we had to get an  extension ladder to get them off," said Deputy Lieutenant R.C. Medlin.
"From the look of some of the seats in there, the positions they were in,  it was a hell of a rude awakening," Medlin said.
