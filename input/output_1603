France is thinking of helping to equip African  peacekeepers among the 5,000 extra troops the United Nations is to send to  Rwanda, the foreign ministry said.
"We are ready to examine contributing to supplying African contingents  called on to participate" in a Rwandan force, the ministry said in a statement.
France had already earmarked 20 million francs (3.5 million dollars) for  humanitarian aid for Rwanda, and had for weeks been calling for international  troops to be sent into the civil war torn nation, the ministry said in a  statement Monday.
Junior health minister Philippe Douste-Blazy would be travelling to  neighbouring Tanzania in the next few days to check on the refugee situation,  the statement said.
