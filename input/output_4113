Vietnamese state banks have lent nearly 100 million  dollars to rice traders so far this year in an effort to buy up sinking  exports of the key commodity, a report said Thursday.
Shortages of working capital have hit traders hard as prices have fallen  and stockpiles mounted, the Tuoi Tre newspaper reported.
Banks have lent 946 billion dong (86 million dollars) in local currency  and 8.4 million dollars in hard currency to traders, who exported 508,000  tonnes of rice in the first four and a half months, the report said.
But traders, badly hurt last year by falling rice prices and the higher  cost of imported fertilisers, are complaining they are still short of capital  despite a 50 percent rise in loans over the same period last year.
Vietnam has become the world's third largest rice exporter after the  United States and Thailand but lacks the processing, storage and credit  facilities to boost exports further.
Rice exports to the end of March were at only 69 percent of last year's  level while average yields were up 21.32 percent to 4.79 tonnes per hectare,  according to figures from the Ministry of Agriculture.
The Mekong delta region, the country's rice basket, where yields are as  high as 6.1 tonnes per hectare, produced 5.23 million tonnes, up by around 25  percent on last year, the ministry said.
In 1993 Vietnam sold some 1.8 million tonnes of rice, down around 10  percent on the record exports a year earlier.
