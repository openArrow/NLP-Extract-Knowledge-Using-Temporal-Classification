Vietnam's most ambitious power project has been  completed with the connection of the trans-Vietnam power line, linking power  grids in the south and north for the first time, officials said Saturday.
The final section of the 500-kilowatt line was connected late Friday, they  said, adding it would go on line in June after the completion of tests which  started in April.
The line is designed to help alleviate power shortages in the south by  bringing electricity from the hydroelectric plant at Hoa Binh south of Hanoi.
The project, which was begun in April 1992, is expected to cost the  government some 500 million dollars, nearly twice the original estimates.
