Immigration Minister Sergio Marchi pledged Monday  to clamp down on alleged abuses of a special entrepreneurial visa which has  allowed thousands of Hong Kong residents to emigrate to Canada.
The so-called entrepreneurial visa allows foreigners to obtain landed  immigrant status in Canada if they invest a minimum of 250,000 dollars  (181,000 US) in a Canadian business and create at least one job for a Canadian.
The investment must be made and the job created within two years of the  immigrant's arrival in Canada.
Although the scheme is valid for any would-be immigrant, it has had its  largest success in Hong Kong, which will be transferred from British  sovereignty to Chinese control in 1997.
Just as most of the entrepreneurial visas have been issued to Hong Kong  residents, most of the reported and alleged abuses have involved immigrants  from the British colony.
Marchi's department has produced a report calling for the deportation of  entrepreneurial immigrants who fail to honor their commitments.
In an interview with a Canadian news agency, Marchi said Monday he hadn't  seen the report yet. But he added: "I wouldn't look too favorably on people  who've basically broken their end of the bargain."
But his officials admit that in many cases they simply cannot locate  entrepreneurial immigrants to verify that they have kept their side of the  deal.
A few years ago, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police broke up a ring  involved in setting up fake businesses in Canada to get entrepreneurial visas.  Some 149 immigrants from Hong Kong were charged.
Government statistics show that, in the first nine months of last year,  there were 28,217 immigrants from Hong Kong with about one fifth of them  entering Canada on entrepreneurial visas.
A government audit carried out in 1992 showed that about 40 percent of the  immigrant investors could not be located.
