Police in the far-eastern Russian town of  Vladivostok have reinforced the security detail around Alexander Solzhenitsyn  following several shooting incidents since his arrival there, ITAR-TASS news  agency said Monday.
The agency, quoting local police in Vladivostok, said several clashes  between armed groups and police have taken place since Solzhenitsyn arrived  there Friday. The incidents are apparently not linked to Solzenitsyn's arrival.
Police said that shortly after Solzhenitsyn arrived in Vladivostok Friday,  a police officer was killed by unkown assailants on the road leading to the  airport. The assailants were identified later in the evening and an ensuing  gunfight left two police officers injured and two assailants dead.
On Sunday, another unidentified assailant opened fire on a police patrol  near the hotel where the former dissident, who returned to his native Russia  last Friday after 20 years in exile, is staying. Two police officers were  injured in that incident.
The Nobel Prize recipient is to leave Vladivostock later this week for a  train journey through Russia. He will then settle in Moscow with his wife  Natalya.
