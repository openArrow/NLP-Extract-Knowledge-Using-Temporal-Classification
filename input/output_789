England's Laura Davies won her second  tournament in a row and the second major of her career here Sunday, surging to  a three-under-par 68 for a three-shot victory in the LPGA Championship.
Davies, who won the 1987 US Women's Open before she joined the LPGA Tour,  pulled away from the field with birdies at 11, 12, 14 and 15, then parred the  next three for a five-under total of 279.
Alice Ritzman, who was seeking her first victory in 17 years on the tour,  bogeyed to of the first three holes but recovered to card a 70 for 282. It was  her eighth second-place finish in 402 tournaments.
Hall-of-Fame golfer Pat Bradley, Sweden's Liselotte Neumann and Japan's  Hiromi Kobayashi shared third place on 283.
Davies, who won the Sara Lee Classic last wee, earned 165,000 dollars to  take her total for the season to 467,628 dollars.
Davies overcame a wild tee shot at the 14th with a 20-foot birdie putt.  She hit another errant tee shot at the par-four 15th, but landed her approach  shot within 18 feet of the pin and made it to move to five-under for the  tournament.
Davies had won the now-defunct McDonald's Classic on the DuPont Country  Club course last year, but Patty Sheehan was the defending LPGA Champion after  winning the 1993 event in Bethesda, Maryland.
Sheehan started the day tied with Ritzman, one shot behind Davies, and  opened with a birdie.
She gave that shot back at the second hole. Bogeys at 12 and 13, followed  by a double bogey at 14, put her out of reach of Davies.
Meg Mallon, who shared the overnight lead with Davies, missed a four-foot  birdie attempt at the second and took a double bogey at the third when she hit  her tee shot in the water. She carded a 75 for 286.
