Portuguese opposition parties called Monday on  Interior Minister Dias Loureiro to resign following a scandal involving the  country's SIS intelligence services.
Loureiro said earlier Monday he had accepted the resignation of SIS  director-general Ladeiro Monteiro and dismissed the service's regional  director in Madeira, Joao Evangelista, two days after the press published the  conclusions of an official report that the SIS had overstepped its authority  in the Portuguese archipelago.
The enquiry arose after allegations by Madeira's prosecutor general that  the SIS had pried into his private life and into the affairs of other  magistrates,  following the discovery late last month of a microphone hidden  under the prosecutor's floorboards.
The allegation was not proved, but the investigation established the SIS  had looked into matters which did not legally concern it. These included  prostitution, the corruption of minors and the affairs of political parties.        One of the SIS's main targets was reputedly the Social Democratic Party of  Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva.
No direct link to the SIS was made but political parties claimed the  organisation had been involved.
In a press conference Loureiro said SIS chief Monteiro had acted with  "great dignity" in submitting his resignation, but the Communist Party, the  Socialists and the right-wing Christian Democrats all said this was not  sufficient, and called for a further probe.
