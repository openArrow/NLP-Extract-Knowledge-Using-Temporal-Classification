Ireland rugby union coach Gerry Murphy has rejected  Wallaby hooker Phil Kearns' claims that the Irish would resort to fighting to  counter Australia's apparent superiority in the coming internationals.
"We have no interest in fighting," said Murphy shortly after the squad  arrived in Canberra for Wednesday's game against the ACT.
"If Kearns' comments are accurate then I would find them very  disappointing," said Ireland team manager Frank Sowman.
Following Sunday's 55-18 win over Ireland, NSW captain Kearns predicted  Ireland would come out "breathing fire" in the tests.
Ireland's team for Wednesday's game will include five players who did not  start in either of its two previous games against NSW and Western Australia.
The newcomers are winger Brian Walsh, flanker Paul Hogan, scrumhalf Alain  Rolland, fly-half Alan McGowan and hooker Shane Byrne, who arrived in  Australia last weekend.
Byrne was called into the squad after a facial injury to hooker Keith  Wood, who will not be available for selection until Sunday's game with  Queensland in Brisbane.
Murphy said Ireland's only casualty from Sunday's game was No.8 Roger  Wilson with a hamstring injury.
Murphy said he would be stressing the importance of ball retention to his  players following the eight-try loss to NSW.
He said as many as five, or even six, positions were still open with just  three games remaining before the opening Test in Brisbane on June 5.
The Ireland team to play ACT is: Jim Staples, Brian Walsh, Martin Ridge,  Maurice Field, Niall Woods, Alan McGowan, Alain Rolland; Peter Clohessy, Shane  Byrne, Garret Halpin, Jeremy Davidson, Michael Galway, David Corkery, Paul  Hogan, Paddy Johns
