The Japanese government will face a minimum 8.9  trillion yen (86 billion dollar) budgetary shortfall at the turn of the  century if the current tax structure is maintained, officials said Tuesday.
A report submitted by the finance ministry to the tax council, an official  advisory panel which is now working on reforming taxes, said the lack of funds  would result from increasing social welfare costs.
Following the report, observers here said the council would likely  recommend increases in indirect taxes when it makes its own report in June.
