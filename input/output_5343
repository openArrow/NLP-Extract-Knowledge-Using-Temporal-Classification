A strong earthquake which hit Indonesia's remote  province of Irian Jaya has killed at least three people, a news report said  here Monday.
Paniai regent Jusuf Adipatah was quoted by the evening daily Suara  Pembaruan as saying that the quake which hit the regency Wednesday also killed  cattle and damaged buildings.
He said officials had faced difficulty gathering reports on the situation  in the isolated area, which has many villages only reachable on foot.
The epicentre of the quake, which measured 5.8 on the Richter scale, was  located between 33 and 450 kilometres (20 and 279 miles) underneath the Gulf  of Cendrawasih, 50 kilometres (30 miles) west of Nabire, the provincial  capital.
It was also felt in Nabire and in Timika about 170 kilometres (105 miles)  south of the capital.
