The Beijing authorities announced Wednesday fresh  price controls on 34 staple commodities following widespread complaints from  residents over illegal price hikes.
"This action aims at putting prices of these commodities and services  within the level residents can stand," the municipal government said in a  report.
Prices of 10 staples, including salt, coal, petrol and housing rents will  be set by the state, while a monitoring system has been set up to record price  fluctuations in 24 others, including rice, edible oil, sugar and pork.
Enterprises or shops wanting to raise prices must apply five-to-10 days in  advance to the municipal price bureau for approval, the report said, adding  that the bureau could intervene if the hikes were too extreme or too frequent.
Since the beginning of the year, price rises of staple commodities in  medium and large cities throughout China -- amid nationwide inflation of  around 21 percent -- have drawn strong protests from urban residents.
In a bid to curb inflation, the State Council sent six price inspection  teams to 14 provinces at the end of March.
According to press reports, the teams have already handled more than  61,000 cases of illegal price-rising cases, involving more than 50 million  yuan (5.7 million dollars).
