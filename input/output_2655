A protest by engineers of state-run Indian  Airlines' continued into its sixth day Saturday, disrupting flights and  stranding hundreds of passengers, officials said.
The All India Aircraft Engineers Association (AIAEA) said no negotiations  were in sight, although the airline's management Friday offered a  productivity-linked 30 percent increase in wages in a bid to end the protest.
"If they call us, we will talk," said J.S. Chabra, general secretary of  AIAEA, whose nearly 700 members have shortened their working hours as part of  a "go slow" campaign to win a wage hike.
The protest has led to delays or cancellations of dozens of Indian  Airlines flights, causing a daily loss of more than 10 million rupees (333,000  dollars), an airline spokesman said.
The number of passengers flying daily with Indian Airlines has fallen from  24,000 to 6,000. Hundreds of passengers have been stranded all over the  country, officials said.
Indian Airlines is among the world's largest regional networks, flying to  some 60 destinations, and also operating international routes.
But inefficiency and frequent labour unrest have seen clients switching  loyalty to newly-started private airlines.
