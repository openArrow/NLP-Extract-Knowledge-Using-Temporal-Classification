Members of the International  Whaling Commission approved setting up a whale sanctuary in Antarctic waters  Thursday after days of heated debate.
With the exception of Japan which cast the sole no vote, delegates  accepted a modified French plan. The final proposal calls for the sanctuary to  stretch from 40 degrees south latitude.
Two areas are not included in this region, one in the Indian Ocean where  there already is a whale sanctuary. The other is in the territorial waters  around Chile and Argentina. There the sanctuary will begin at 60 degrees south.
In the final vote, 23 were in favor, Japan against, and China, Dominica,  Grenada, South Korea, Saint Vicent and the Grenadines and the Solomon Islands  abstained. Norway, which had fought to continue hunting, was absent.
Observers said the latest compromise included 90 percent of the protection  zone originally proposed by France.
Twenty-three of the 31 countries represented at the conference had to  approve a proposal for it to pass.
France had originally proposed a total ban on hunting whales below the  40th parallel in Antarctica. The 40th parallel circles the globe south of  Buenos Aires, Santiago and south of Australia and the southern tip of Africa.
The proposed sanctuary is designed to protect the 1,000 remaining blue  whales, which grow to 30 meters (100 feet) and can weigh 150 tonnes, and some  12,000 humpback whales.
The no-hunting zone would also benefit the much smaller minke whale, which  has replaced the blue and humpback as a target of Japanese and Norwegian  whalers.
The Japanese said such a ban actually would be harmful to the environment.
Japan estimates the minke population at 750,000 and said the animals eat  roughly five times the amount of fish humans catch.
Japan had proposed to hunt up to 2,000 minke whales and said that would  not threaten the species, prized as a dining delicacy in Japan.
