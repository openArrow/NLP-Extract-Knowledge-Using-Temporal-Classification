Jim Courier, three matches away from his third title  in four years at the French Open, needed to work his way through a dramatic  fourth set tie-break to slap back a plucky challenge from Frenchman Olivier  Delaitre in front of an appreciative centre-court crowd at the Roland Garros  Stadium on Sunday.
The seventh-seeded American, who now plays either Pete Sampras or Swedish  quaifier Mikael Tillstroem for a place in the semi-finals, scored a 6-1, 6-7  (7/9), 6-1, 7-6 (8/6) win over an opponent ranked 76th in the world.
