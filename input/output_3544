The British BET group of industrial services  recovered from losses last year, showing pre-tax profits of 92 million pounds  (138 million dollars) compared to a loss of 10 million pounds in 1992, the  company said on Tuesday.
This improvement in results for the year to April 2, was attributable to a  three-year "transformation" programme destined to return the company to  profits after two years of losses. BET had disposed of 17 companies for 58  million pounds.
BET, which employs almost 100,000 people worldwide, reported a  nine-percent decline in sales to 1.97 billion pounds from 2.17 billion pounds.
Managing director John Clark indicated that trading conditions were  improving in the United States but remained "delicate in Britain and on the  continent."
He estimated that BET could henceforth benefit from a large financial  injection to "support internal growth and acquisitions."
BET is Britain's leading company in industrial textiles, company cleaning  and security services.
The dividend remained unchanged at 3.25 pence, while earnings per share  rose to 6.9 pence from losses per share of four pence last year.
The price of shares in the company rose by one pence to 131.5 pence here.
