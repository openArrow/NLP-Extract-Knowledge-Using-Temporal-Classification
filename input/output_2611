Singapore plans to buy 18 US-made F-A-18  fighter jets along with an array of ammunition and spare parts for a total of  1.5 billion dollars, Defense Department officials said Friday.
The planes would be in lieu of F-16s the Asian country said last year it  intended to purchase. Singapore could choose between the two aircraft at a  later date, the Pentagon said.
In a letter to Congress, the Pentagon said the sale "would contribute to  the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping  improve the security of a friendly country which has been and continues to be  an important force for economic progress in Southeast Asia."
Under US law, Congress has 30 days to block the sale of the planes, which  would be built by McDonnell Douglas.
The sale would include spare engines, 268,000 rounds of ammunition,  Sidewinder and Sparrow missiles and spare parts.
