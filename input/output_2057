Gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter of  1994 is expected to be "significantly higher" than for the same period in  1993, the Economy Ministry said Thursday in its monthly report.
"The economic indicators are increasingly upward-oriented," the ministry  said, observing that in ex-East Germany the economy was moreover "on a growth  course."
But the labour market in both parts of Germany remained tense.
Demand for industrial products had "considerably grown" in the first  quarter, and this was expected to boost industrial production, the report  said. Above all, export orders had "grown strongly."
Export orders for west German firms increased by a seasonally-corrected  six percent in the first quarter of the year compared with the same period  last year, the Economy Ministry said.
