New Delhi police are experimenting with shorter  and lighter batons to stop constables from misusing the "lathi" -- their most  visible symbol of power when they walk their beats.
Members of the 35,000-strong force will be equipped with Western-style  truncheons instead of the long, heavy bamboo staves in the experiment being  tried out this week in some city districts, The Pioneer reported Wednesday.
Senior police officers told the newspaper that shorter batons would stop  policemen from "unconsciously" misusing the stick.
"If you carry a long lathi, you keep on hitting the ground or anything  within sight without even realising it," an officer said, adding that a  shorter baton would curb the policeman's reach.
On night patrols however the police will revert back to wielding the lathi  because its size made it a more effective defensive weapon.
