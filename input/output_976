French intellectuals will present a "Sarajevo list"  in the European elections on June 12 to denounce European inaction over  Bosnia, French philospher Andre Gluckman said on Monday.
Gluckman said the intention was "to explain to Europeans in general and to  the French people in particular that their future is at stake over there (in  Bosnia)."
In an interview with the right-wing daily Le Quotidien, Gluckman said the  "prevailing consensus is not to speak of the massacres" in former Yugoslavia.
The Sarajevo list is being formed by Gluckman with writer and journalist  Bernard-Henri Levy and could be headed by medical professor Leon  Schwartzenberg.
Gluckman said political will was lacking to halt the war in former  Yugoslavia although "we have the means" in NATO, which was conceived "to  resist an army of five million soldiers with nuclear weapons, the Red Army."
Levy presented his film "Bosna" at the Cannes Film Festival Sunday, a  two-hour panegyric to Bosnian Moslem fighters that denounces European and  American policy as preferring "a drip feed of humanitarian aid" to providing  the Bosnians with arms to defend themselves.
