The US economy expanded three percent in the  first three months of the year, sharply higher than initially estimated, the  Commerce Department said Friday.
The first estimate, in April, was that the US gross domestic product grew  2.6 percent.
The department's second of three estimates surprised most analysts, who  had forecast a downward revision to 2.4 percent.
An inflation index linked to the GDP rose 2.6 percent, unchanged from the  original estimate.
On the bond market, interest rates on the main 30-year Treasury bond  jumped to 7.42 percent from 7.35 percent late Thursday.
At 8:50 a.m. (1250 GMT) on the currency market, the dollar traded at  1.6485 German marks and 104.60 yen, compared with 1.6480 marks and 104.63 yen  two hours earlier in London.
The first-quarter slowdown in economic growth following a roaring seven  percent increase in the final quarter of 1993 was weaker than first estimated,  the department said.
Higher spending by the government and consumers and a less severe drop in  exports offset a drop in business inventories, according to the revised  estimates.
Consumer spending rose a revised 4.6 percent, up from 3.8 percent. A  decline in public spending was 3.6 percent, not 14.9 percent as first  reported. Exports were down one percent, not 15 percent. Imports rose 8.6  percent, from 2.8 percent.
The department also reported that after-tax corporate profits fell 3.7  percent in the first quarter to 284.9 billion dollars, compared with a 7.9  percent increase in the final quarter of 1993.
