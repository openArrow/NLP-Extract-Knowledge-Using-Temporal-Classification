Teen tennis phenomenon Jennifer Capriati  was treated at a drug rehabilitation center three months before her arrest  last Monday for possession of marijuana, Newsweek magazine reports.
In it's latest edition, Newsweek reports that Capriati was treated for  more than a week at The Manors, a 950-dollar-a-day private psychiatric  hospital in Tarpon Springs, Florida.
The Manors refused to confirm the report and a spokeswoman for Capriati,  Linda Dozoretz, declined to comment.
Timineet Branagan, the 17-year-old neice of a Newsweek contributing  editor, was one of two people arrested with Capriati. She was charged with  possessing heroin.
Branagan, who had been treated at The Manors, reportedly met Capriati  through another former patient of the clinic, a 16-year-old girl friendly with  the tennis star.
The trio embarked on a weekend of partying that ended when Branagan's  parents called police to the Florida motel room Capriati had rented.
Nathan Wilson, who said he partied with the group, told Newsweek he used  cocaine and heroin with Capriati. Tom Wineland, a 20-year-old transient  arrested with Capriati and Branagan, had made similar charges.
But Mark Black, a 19-year-old who also attended the party, said Capriati  did not use heavy drugs.
Branagan's stepfather, who was not named by Newsweek, arrived at the motel  on Sunday and saw Capriati, who he said looked "dazed, bloated, whacked-out on  something."
He took his stepdaughter home, but she climbed out a window and returned  to the motel, so her parents called the police.
