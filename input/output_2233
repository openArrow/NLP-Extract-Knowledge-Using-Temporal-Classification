A buddhist in catholic Italy, a shy, undemonstrative  man from a nation of extroverts: it is not surprising that Roberto Baggio is  also an original on the field.
Nine years after being told by doctors he would never play again, the  Juventus forward leads Italy to the United States acclaimed as a beacon of  flair and imagination in a game increasingly dominated by tactical rigour.
"Baggio is the most imaginative player in the world today," said Johan  Cruyff, the Dutchman who as a player was to the seventies what Baggio is set  to become for the nineties.
The only thing football pundits can't make up their minds about, is what  to call him. Is he a striker or a playmaker?
The issue has dogged Baggio since he took his first steps in professional  football as a fragile 16-year-old with Vicenza in Serie C of the Italian  league.
By the start of the last World Cup in Italy, he had joined Fiorentina and  already done enough to demonstrate he was the most talented player the hosts  had produced in years.
Unfortunately though, the national coach, Azeglio Vicini, was the only  Italian unconvinced the then 23-year-old was the man to lead them to glory.
Vicini liked his players to fit into recognisable categories and he wanted  Baggio to play as a striker. Baggio was adamanant he needed to play deeper to  find the space to make his talent count.
The stand-off meant Italy started the World Cup with Gianluca Vialli and  Toto Schillaci up front. Baggio might have spent the entire tournament on the  bench if Vialli had not been injured in the opening game and forced Vicini to  throw the young lion into Rome's Olympic arena against Czechoslavkia.
Baggio's response was to score a goal of such breathtaking audacity that a  line was permanently drawn under all the arguments about what kind of player  he should be.
