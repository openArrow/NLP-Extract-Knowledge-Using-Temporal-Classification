Australian champions Brisbane Broncos  and English rugby league giants Wigan will play for a 400,000 dollar (288,000  US) winner-take-all stake in Wednesday's world club challenge here, officials  announced Monday.
Players on the winning team will each receive more than 11,000 dollars  (8,000 US) from their half share of the purse.
The prizemoney will be deducted from an anticipated one million dollar  (720,000 US) gate should the match, to be televised live back to Britain, be a  sell-out.
More than 45,000 tickets have been pre-sold, with the Broncos' ground  record of 58,593 set against St George last August likely to be broken.
Wigan, who will be without key forwards Kelvin Skerrett and Andy Platt,  are rated 7-4 outsiders to take the championship back to Lancashire. The  Broncos are rated 1-3 to retain the title they won from Wigan 22-8 at Central  Park in 1992.
