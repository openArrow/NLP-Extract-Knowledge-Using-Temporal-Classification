South Korea summoned an emergency meeting of senior  officials here Saturday hours after the IAEA reported problems in checking  suspicions that North Korea was covering up a nuclear weapons program.
At the meeting, called by Foreign Minister Han Sung-Joo, officials  discussed the North's moves and possible motives. But they decided to refrain  from comment pending a full IAEA report, a ministry spokesman said.
"Until the IAEA makes an official report, the government is not in a  position to make any comment," ambassador Kim Sam-Hoon in charge of the  nuclear issue said in a press statement.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said earlier North Korea had  resumed refuelling at its Yongbyon nuclear reactor, threatening to make a full  accounting of weapons-grade fuel impossible.
IAEA director general Hans Blix said the accelerated pace of fuel rod  removal could, "within days," make it impossible for inspectors to determine  whether weapons-grade plutonium had been diverted for military use.
The foreign ministry officials discussed the intentions of the North in  refusing to allow the IAEA opportunities to test the used fuel rods from the  reactor in Yongbyon, Yonhap news agency said.
The officials suspected the North might be playing its usual brinkmanship  to the hilt to draw maximum concessions from the United States when the  US-North Korea high-level talks resumed, Yonhap said.
But they also raised the possibility that the North was attempting to  cover up a nuclear weapons development program by pushing ahead with the  removal of fuel rods despite repeated warnings of UN sanctions, Yonhap said.
