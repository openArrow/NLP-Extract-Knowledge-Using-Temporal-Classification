Mexico are clearly looking forward to their return to World Cup football.  As hosts in 1986 they acheived their best result, losing on penalties to West  Germany in the quarter-finals.
They were suspended by FIFA for a year for fielding over-age players in a  the World Youth Cup, missing out on Italia '90.
But their confidence was hurt by two poor results in February. They lost  5-1 to Switzerland and 4-1 to Russia and fans feared the defeats had exposed a  weakness against the kind of quick, European attacks Mexico will face in first  round matches against Italy, Ireland and Norway.
Baron said the defeats were due mostly to fatigue, and his men did beat  Sweden 2-1 later in February but a goalless draw against Colombia didn't fully  convince some critics.
They will have their first World Cup test on June 19, when they open their  campaign against Norway at RFK Stadium in Washington.
