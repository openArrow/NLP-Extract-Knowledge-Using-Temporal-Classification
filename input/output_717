A "surprise" included in the schedule of  the 47th Cannes International Film Festival is by leading South Korean  director Shin, Sang Okk, reliable sources said Sunday.
The director, who is on the jury judging the main competition of the  festival, will see have his latest film "Vanished" screened at a special  projection here on Tuesday night.
The movie is not in competition at the festival, which opened last  Thursday and is due to end next Monday.
It will not be the first time that the surprise selection is by a member  of the festival jury. In 1979 Francoise Sagan, president of the jury that  year, saw her film "The Blue Ferns" screened.
Okk, long seen as one of South Korea's most prolific directors, was held  captive for some years in North Korea before fleeing to the United States in  1986.
