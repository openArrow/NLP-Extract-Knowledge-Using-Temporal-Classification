Paul Ince, who is delaying an operation on a hernia, looks certain to  return for Kevin Richardson in midfield, while Dennis Wise could come in for  the disappointing Paul Merson.
Venables may also give Les Ferdinand a run, and recall David Seaman in  goal.
England captain David Platt has told how England's failure to qualify for  the World Cup finals in the USA hurts him more and more as the tournament  approaches.
The Sampdoria star says he will spend the summer hiding away on a  Caribbean beach and then take a motoring holiday round France, just hoping  that he can avoid restaurants and bars with television sets.
Platt said: "I'll be in hotel rooms, flick on the TV and there it will be.  Now what's going to be first thing through your mind?
"When we didn't qualify I just felt numb. You don't put it into  perspective. But when I pick up papers in Italy and see all the pull-outs  about the 24 teams who are going to be there -- that's when it hits you."
