Vietnamese vice-prime minister Tran Duc Luong has  made a fresh appeal for normalisation of relations with Washington following a  10-day semi-official visit to the United States.
Luong led a team of senior officials and businessmen to the United States  from May 18-28, the most high-powered mission since the end of the Vietnam war.
In an interview published in the media here Tuesday, Luong described the  trip as satisfactory and said the response from American businessmen had been  "very positive."
During the visit, preliminary agreements were reached for the supply of  Vietnamese rice to the United States, the signing of oil exploration contracts  and the opening of direct air links between the two countries.
Luong said business leaders in New York, Washington and San Francisco had  spoken in favour of complete normalisation of relations between Hanoi and  Washington and the rapid approval of most-favoured-nation preferential trade  status for Vietnam.
Luong met Secretary of State Warren Christopher during his visit as well  as the heads of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and United  Nations Development Fund.
US firms have invested 78 million dollars in 11 projects in Vietnam since  Washington lifted its economic embargo in February, according to official  statistics.
Last week the United States and Vietnam agred to open liaison offices in  their respective capitals, the first step toward normal diplomatic relations  between the former enemies.
