"Serious accidents" cut off three train routes  from the southern Chinese city Guangzhou to destinations in southwestern and  eastern China this week, a semi-official news agency reported here.
The train services between Guangzhou and Kunming in Yunnan province and  Chongqing in Sichuan provinces were suspended following "a serious accident"  Wednesday night, the Hong Kong branch of China News Service said.
The report did not give the nature of the accident, adding that  authorities were "looking into the cause of the problems."
The resumption of train services from Guangzhou depended on the completion  of "emergency repair" works, it added.
Meanwhile, it said an accident on a rail bridge in Zhangshu, Jiangxi  province in eastern China on Tuesday also suspended indefinitely train  services from Guangzhou to Nanjing, Nanchang and Hangzhou.
The bridge accident had not been reported earlier.
