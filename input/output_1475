In keeping with President Bill Clinton's pledge  to be open and avoid any appearance of conflict of interest, the White House  published the first family's net worth for 1993 Tuesday.
But the financial disclosure -- which also included first daughter  Chelsea's assets -- only gave a ballpark figure of between 633,000 and 1.6  million dollars as it was calculated on a margin, rather than exact worth.
Last July, Clinton voluntarily put most of his assets in a "blind trust,"  an independently managed account that presidents traditionally use in order to  avoid any suspicion of using their office for personal enrichment.
Aside from the assets in that account, the Clintons' earned 293,000  dollars in 1993 income, 189,000 dollars from the president's salary.
It was the first time in years that Clinton made more than his wife, who  was a high-powered lawyer in Arkansas while he was making about 33,000 dollars  annually as governor.
The Clintons also received a couple of pricey gifts from Hollywood  friends, including 530 dollar picture frames from actor Tom Hanks and a 1,200  painting from singer Carly Simon.
Clinton announced that he would make full disclosure of his earnings last  month when the media was giving big play to his soured Whitewater land deal  and raising questions about his wife's uncanny ability to turn a 1,000 dollar  cattle futures investment into 100,000 dollars.
