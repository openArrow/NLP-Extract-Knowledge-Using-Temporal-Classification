Rwandan rebels captured Kigali airport Sunday, the  UN Mission for Aid to Rwanda announced.
Spokesman Abdul Kabia said an adjoining military base, Camp Kanombe, was  still held by the mainly Hutu government army, but was encircled by troops of  the mostly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front.
The battle for the airport had raged four days, preventing relief planes  from landing and halting UN efforts to pave the way for a new peacekeeping  mission.
The United Nations has been trying to secure neutral status for the  airport to allow it to fly in humanitarian aid and reinforcements for the UN  peacekeeping troops.
The rebels replied that they considered the airport a military target  because of the government army base beside it.
At least two million of Rwanda's seven million people have been made  homeless by the fighting which erupted in early April, and hundreds of  thousands have fled the country.
Estimates of those butchered range up to around 500,000.
