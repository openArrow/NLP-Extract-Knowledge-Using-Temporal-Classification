Fifty years after the Allied landings rolled back  the German occupation of France, a majority of the French believe that the  French Resistance and the Allies share the credit equally, an opinion poll  said Monday.
The poll published by the daily Le Monde said that 64 percent of the 969  French nationals interviewed believed that the French Resistance and the  Allies "contributed equally to the liberation of France."
Twenty five percent said that the Allied intervention contributed the most  to the liberation of France, while 10 percent said the Resistance had done so.
The poll, published to coincide with commemorative ceremonies next weekend  marking the 50th anniversary of the Normandy landings, was part of a wider  survey also carried out in the United States, Germany and Britain by the  French daily and CNN.
But the question on the contribution to the liberation of France was only  put to the French respondents.
On other issues, the respondents in all four countries notably said that  Russia was the least reliable ally of each: 13 percent in France thought  Moscow was a good ally, 29 percent in Britain, 20 percent in Germany and 40  percent in the United States.
The poll was carried out between May 10 and 22.
