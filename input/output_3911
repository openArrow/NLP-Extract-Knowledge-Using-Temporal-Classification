Ballesteros responded only briefly to the decision, saying: "I told you it  would be. It was certain."
Ken Schofield, executive director of the European Tour, announced that the  committee's decision was unanimous.
"In these difficult last few weeks Seve's view was pretty different from  the remainder of the committee," he said.
"We have been pretty frank with him and with the other venues to kind of  mark their cards accurately.
"The committee's opinion was that Valderrama best met the requirements of  course, location, accommodation and accessibility.
"Seve's comments didn't take up a lot of time at this morning's meeting.  The committee's job was to choosen a venue based on our exhaustive studies."
Emma Villaceiros, president of the Royal Spanish Golf Federation, added:  "There will be people who thought it should go to Madrid or El Saler or  Seville, but the main thing is that the Ryder Cup is going to Spain.
"I'm not going to get involved in rows. The committee have made the right  decision."
