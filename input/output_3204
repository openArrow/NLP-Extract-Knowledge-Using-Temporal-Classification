Three Thai women were sentenced to 10 years in  prison each Monday for killing another Thai woman who had forced them to  become prostitutes, news reports said.
The prosecution's demand of life imprisonment for the three, aged 27 to  32, was rejected.
"Their offense was premeditated and cruel," the presiding judge was quoted  as saying in handing down the verdict. "But the victim had treated the three  accused women with complete disregard for their human rights, by making them  prostitutes themselves," the judge said.
The three stabbed 28-year-old Win Uoochai Sirirat September 29, 1991 at an  apartment they shared in Shimotsuma city in Ibaraki.
They then robbed her of some seven million yen (67,000 dollars) in cash  and recovered their passports which had been taken away by the victim.
