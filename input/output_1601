India's world record breaking allrounder Kapil  Dev said Wednesday he did not know how to tamper with the ball and was unaware  other bowlers did so.
Kapil Dev, taker of a record 434 wickets in tests and 252 in one-day  cricket, said he was ignorant of former Pakistani captain Imran Khan's claim  that ball-tampering was a common practice.
"I've never done that," said the 35-year-old medium pacer who started his  career in Pakistan in 1978. "If I had done that I would have bagged 500  wickets by now.
"Frankly, we didn't know that a ball could be tampered with, so how could  we do that?"
Kapil said team-mates were baffled when Pakistani bowlers swung the old  ball, but did not know how it was done.
"We were surprised when they made the old ball wobble in the air specially  after a drinks or lunch interval, but we could not put our finger on the real  reason.
"If what Imran says is true, the concerned bowlers must get full credit  for keeping it a secret for so long."
