Labor Minister Kunio Hatoyama is the richest member  of Japan's cabinet, while Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata ranks 12th in personal  wealth among his 21 coalition colleagues, figures released Tuesday showed.
Hatoyama, the 45-year-old son of late foreign minister Iichiro Hatoyama  and a grandson of a former prime minister, reported personal assets valued at  2.078 billion yen (19.8 million dollars).
But his assets, including a 662-square-meter residence in central Tokyo  and membership at five golf links, were estimated to be worth about eight  billion yen if his real estate and stocks were valued at going prices.
The cabinet, which ranges from affluent conservatives to frugal centrists,  published the list of personal assets in line with a practice put in place in  1984 following a series of money scandals involving members of the then-ruling  Liberal Democratic Party.
Hata, 58, who took office a month ago after his predecessor Morihiro  Hosokawa was forced to step down amid a series of corruption scandals,  reported assets totalling 79 million yen, compared to the average of 178  million yen among the cabinet members.
The assets reported by Hata, a former bus company employee and a son of a  parliamentarian, included 50,000 yen in stocks and three golf club memberships.
Ministers from the Buddhist-backed Komeito and the centrist Democratic  Socialist Party ranked low on the list of assets and were burdened with  housing loans.
Transport Minister Nobuaki Futami from Komeito was at the bottom of the  list with real estate worth 1.6 million yen at face value but no savings or  stock holdings.
