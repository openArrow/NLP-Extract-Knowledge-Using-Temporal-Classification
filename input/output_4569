The captured head of an insurgent communist  assassination unit will be charged with murder for publicly saying his group  was behind the killing of a former police official earlier this month,  officials said here Friday.
Police investigation chief, Senior Superintendent Romeo Acop said they  would charge Felimon Lagman, head of the Alex Boncayo Brigade (ABB), a  Manila-based murder squad, with the slaying of former chief inspector Timoteo  Zarcal on the basis of press interviews where he claimed credit for the  killing.
Acop said he would subpoena newsmen who interviewed Lagman to get  "corroborating statements that it was really the ABB chief who gave the  interview and admitted that the crime was the handiwork of the ABB."
In a related event, military chief, Lieutenant General Arturo Enrile said  the military was on alert for any attacks the ABB might stage to retaliate for  their leader's capture on Thursday by Naval intelligence agents in a suburb of  this city.
Lagman, whose ABB is credited with killing more than 200 people including  a US colonel, already faces kidnapping charges for holding five soldiers  hostage in 1987.
Lagman was an advocate of urban armed struggle, splitting last year from  the insurgency's main body led by the Netherlands-based party founder Jose  Maria Sison, who has stuck to the classic Maoist theory of rural warfare  despite failing to seize power after 25 years.
President Fidel Ramos is offering a political settlement, including  amnesty, to communist and Moslem guerrillas as well as right-wing military  officers involved in coup attempts against his predecessor Corazon Aquino.
However the communists and the government have not signed a ceasefire and  authorities continue to arrest guerrilla leaders.
