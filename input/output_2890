The parliament here approved a new law Sunday  imposing heavy taxes and tougher controls on foreign trucks transporting goods  into Iran.
The amount of the taxes or the type of controls were not specified.
Some 120,000 heavy-goods lorries cross into Iran every year, mainly from  Turkey, deputies said.
The new law is partly a retaliatory measure against Turkey which imposed  tough controls on about 5,000 Iranian trucks crossing its borders.
In addition to the high cost of gasoline -- 20 times higher than in Iran  -- Iranian truckers undergo numerous police checks and can only travel on  specified roads in Turkey, deputies added.
