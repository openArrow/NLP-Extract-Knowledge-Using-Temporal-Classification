Japan and the United States are to discuss next week  a US proposal to expand the scope of bilateral cooperation to deal with global  issues, a foreign ministry official said Monday.
Japanese and US officials plan to meet in Washington on May 24 to consider  the additional items in "the common agenda for cooperation from a global  perspective," which is part of bilateral framework talks, the official said.
Proposals include increasing information exchanges to monitor production  and distribution of drugs such as cocaine and heroin and developing an  information exchange system linking Europe, the United States and the  Asia-Pacific region with an aim of preventing global warming, the official  said.
The framework talks have been stalled in the area of macroeconomic  subjects as well as specific areas such as automobiles, government procurement  and insurance, but Tokyo and Washington have been continuing talks on  bilateral cooperation on global issues.
