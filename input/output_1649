Government forces were still fighting Wednesday  to regain ground along the road linking Cambodia's second city of Battambang  to the Khmer Rouge's Pailin headquarters.
The government forces had secured control of Sdao on National Route 10  about 30 kilometers (18.7 miles) west of Battambang, a government official  said.
But the troops were exchanging artillery fire with Khmer Rouge guerrillas  based in Treng, 10 kilometers (six miles) further to the west, an official  from a humanitarian aid agency operating in the area said.
Treng was the government's original frontline position before the royal  armed forces launched their offensive which led to the March 19 capture of  Pailin.
But, exactly one month later, the guerrillas counterattacked, re-took  their "capital" and surged forward to within 15 kilometers (9 miles) of  Battambang city.
Western diplomats said the Khmer Rouge's sudden advance had more to do  with their taking advantage of the panic of the ill-disciplined government  forces than with the guerrillas' military prowess.
The government troops, however, brought in reinforcements, rallied their  strength and have since been slowly pushing the guerrillas back.
Over 40,000 people fled their homes to escape the fighting in early May  and some 30,000 were still camped out along Route 10, on the outskirts of  Battambang city, waiting for the fighting to end, so they can return to home,  the aid official said.
But many of the villagers' houses adjacent to the road were burned to the  ground in recent clashes.
Government and military officials in the capital claimed the army had  retaken Treng more than two weeks ago, but officers in Battambang admitted  this was an exaggeration and said their troops had yet to regain the area.
There were no reports of casualties.
