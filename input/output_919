Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic supports  last Friday's Geneva declaration on Bosnia by representatives of the European  Union. the United States and Russia, Russian special envoy to former  Yugoslavia Vitali Churkin said Monday.
"President Milosevic and Belgrade fully support the Geneva declaration  proposing an end to hostilities in Bosnia," the Tanjug news agency quoted  Churkin as saying at the end of a 90-minute meeting with the Serbian leader.
The Russian envoy arrived in Belgrade late Sunday to inform the Serbian  authorities of the outcome of the Geneva meeting which he said he hoped had  provided a framework to bring about a peace settlement.
Churkin announced he would "very soon" be recommending to UN special envoy  Yasushi Akashi that a meeting of the warring parties be called to negotiate  what he called "one of the elements of the Geneva declaration: an end to the  fighting."
