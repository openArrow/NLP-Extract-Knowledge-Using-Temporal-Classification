French state-controlled bank Credit Lyonnais has  issued a summons to claw back 100 million francs (17.25 million dollars) of  money owed to it by a company belonging to parliamentarian Bernard Tapie, a  senior bank official said Saturday.
The cash, lent to Bernard Tapie Finance (BTF), reportedly constitutes  money left over from the controversial entrepreneur's sale of sportswear firm  Adidas.    Dominique Bazy, a member of the bank's executive committee,  confirmed a report on the summons in French daily Le Figaro.
The bank, which has backed the Marseille lawmaker's financial schemes  since the 1970s, has over the past week stepped up pressure on him to begin  paying off his debts to the bank, which total 1.2 billion francs (220 million  dollars).
Tapie already faces litigation which could see him lose his home,  furniture and works of art as well as a mansion and hotel he owns in Paris.
The business tycoon is being investigated for fraud and embezzlement for  business and football activities.
Tapie is the owner of Olympique Marseille football club, itself in deep  financial trouble and relegated to the second division for match-fixing a year  ago just before it won the European Cup against AC Milan.
He has to raise 450 million francs (77.6 million dollars) by Thursday and  also faces judicial moves to strip him of parliamentary immunity.
Undeterred, Tapie is going ahead with his campaign to become a Euro-MP at  next month's elections to the European Parliament and heads a list for a  centre-left splinter party.
Tapie has specifically been accused of tax evasion, registering his  private yacht as a commercial vessel.
