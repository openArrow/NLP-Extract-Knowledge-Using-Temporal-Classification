Azerbaijani Defence Minister Mamedrafi Mamedov  will travel to Moscow Thursday to meet with Russian Defence Minister General  Pavel Grachev for talks on Nagorno-Karabakh, the spokesman for the Azerbaijani  defence ministry said by telephone from Baku.
The spokesman said details of the Azerbaijani proposals to stop  hostilities in the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh would not be made  known until after the meeting.
Azerbaijani and Karabakh Armenian forces have been fighting over the  disputed enclave, inside Azerbaijan but populated by an Armenian majority,  since 1988.
Senior Azerbaijani sources claim Azerbaijan refused to sign the latest  ceasefire agreement Tuesday after negotiators from the Russian defence  ministry proposed that the political status of Nagorno-Karabakh be resolved  before a withdrawal of Armenian troops from Azerbaijani territory surrounding  the enclave.
Azerbaijan wants the withdrawal of Armenian troops from its territory  first and negotiations on Karabakh's status second.
The Russian-brokered ceasefire agreement called for the deployment of  military observers to be followed by the arrival of 1,800 troops from the  Commonwealth of Independent States to separate the warring sides.
An Azerbaijani source said Tuesday that the situation at the front had  been quiet since the failure of the latest ceasefire agreement -- the fifth  this year. But the Yerevan-based spokesman for the self-styled republic of  Nagorno Karabakh said late Tuesday that there had been fighting around  Mardakert and Agdam on the northeastern front.
"The idea that peace will come in a few weeks or months is a fairy tale,"  said Arif Yunusov, president of the opposition "Azeri" Independent Information  Analytical Centre in Baku: "It is like the Arab-Israeli conflict - it will  take many years to resolve," he said.
