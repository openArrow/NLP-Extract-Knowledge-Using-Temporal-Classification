A supporter of double winners Manchester United was  seriously injured by a missile at the end of United's FA Cup final victory  over Chelsea at Wembley on Saturday.
A Scotland Yard spokesman confirmed the news, and added: "There is a  suggestion that he could lose an eye."
The supporter was transferred to the Western Ophthalmic Hospital in  Central London, after first being examined in a West London hospital.
The spokesman said three had been 35 arrests in and around the stadium and  the total was expected to rise after "sporadic minor disorder" around the  ground and surrounding streets.
Thirteen of the 35 arrests were for alleged drunk and disorderly offences.  Six were Chelsea fans, while seven supported United.
Fourteen people were arrested for public order matters, nine Chelsea and  five Manchester United.
There was one arrest for alleged assault, one for possession of drugs -  both United supporters -- while five Chelsea fans were arrested for possessing  missiles.
The disorder came after United won 4-0 with a rush of goals in the second  half.
