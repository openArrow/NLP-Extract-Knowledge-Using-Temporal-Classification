Japan's Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. Ltd. suffered a  special loss of 130 billion yen (1.25 billion dollars) in the year to March  after writing off bad loans by six affiliates, industry sources said Friday.
The industry sources said the writeoffs were the the first ever by a  Japanese life insurance company and offset by sales of property and securities  which raised some 80 billion yen.
Sumitomo's unrealised gains on property and securities holding at the end  of March were estimated at being some 25 times larger at 2,000 billion yen.
