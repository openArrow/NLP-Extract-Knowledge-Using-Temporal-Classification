PLO leader Yasser Arafat will visit  the occupied territories early next month, the chief PLO negotiator at the  autonomy talks with Israel Nabil Shaath said here late on Thursday.
Shaath said Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) chairman,   would come "in the first half of June".
Shaath, 55, is the most senior member of the Palestinian diaspora to visit  the occupied territories since 1967.
He is one of the 18 chosen members of the autonomous Palestinian Authority  for the Gaza Strip and Jericho on the West Bank.
Shaath said it was the first time he had been to Gaza for 40 years.  He  said he had come "to see if everything is going well on the ground" and to  look into the "urgent" matter of funding of the Palestinian police force.
"I was here in February 1964 for a conference of Palestinian students," he  said at a press conference, adding: "I am very happy to be back."
Shaath, who was accompanied by Zohdi al-Kadra the PLO's "ambassador" in  Cairo, said he would be staying "only 24 hours" in Gaza.
Shaath crossed into Gaza from Egypt at Rafah. He was welcomed there by the  Israeli military commander in Gaza General Doron Almog, an Israeli military  spokesman said.
Amin al-Hindi, who is believed to have helped to organise the 1972  massacre of 11 Israeli athletes in Munich, entered the Gaza Strip unhindered  at Rafah.  He will take over as external intelligence chief for the autonomous  Palestinian territories.
In another development, 500 extra police drawn from the ranks of the  Palestine Liberation Army in Yemen arrived Thursday night in the Gaza Strip  bringing the total number of Palestinian policemen there to 3,500.
