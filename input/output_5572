Police continued Monday to seal off an area around  the Belgian ambassador's residence where 113 asylum-seekers have been holed up  since Saturday, while ambassadors from eight European Union countries met to  discuss the situation.
The EU ambassadors met at the Greek ambassador's residence for about two  hours, but made no comment on the matter.
In Brussels, a Belgian foreign ministry spokesman said the Belgian  government had won "verbal guarantees" from the Cuban authorities that  asylum-seeking Cubans would not be prosecuted.
Brussels said it had also asked the Cubans to provide enough food and  water for the asylum-seekers. The residency normally houses three or four  officials in addition to the ambassador.
A total of 114 Cubans broke into the Belgian ambassador's residency on  Saturday requesting political asylum in Belgium. One of them left voluntarily  Monday.
The official Cuban news agency Prensa Latina cited officials as saying the  two countries agreed the asylum-seekers acted illegally.
Serafin Rodriguez, a Cuban foreign ministry official cited by the agency,  said the government agreed the Cubans could apply for immigration visas after  leaving the ambassador's residence.
Journalists were kept away Monday from the compound, located in the  residential Miramar neighborhood of the capital.
On Sunday, Cuba's state-run television blamed Florida-based anti-Castro  radio stations and the US government for the occupation of the building.
The United States routinely grants political asylum to Cubans who request  it after reaching US shores -- a policy Cuba has blamed for encouraging  emigrants' risky trips in unseaworthy vessels. A restricted number of US visas  are granted in Havana, where Washington has an Interests Section office but no  embassy.
