Former Formula One flop Michael  Andretti backed FIA's decision to go ahead with Sunday's Monaco grand prix  following Karl Wendlinger's horror crash and the deaths of Ayrton Senna and  Roland Ratzenberger.
Andretti, who quit McLaren after less than one season after failing to  repeat his IndyCar success in Formula One, said in the run-up to the  Indianapolis 500 here: "To cancel one race, what would that accomplish? Karl  Wendlinger wouldn't want the race cancelled if he was on the other side of it.
"If you're going to cancel Monaco, you might as well cancel the rest of  the year. The problem is not the races.
"It's that the neck and shoulder protection need to be improved."
