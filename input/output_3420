One-time cover-girl Janet Sackman, whose face  smiled out from magazines and billboards with the slogan "Smoke a Lucky and  feel your level-best" is appearing here in a new series of commercials for an  anti-smoking campaign.
The American former "Lucky Strike" girl, now 62, uses oesophageal speech  to broadcast her message on the perils of smoking, which she says cost her  part of a lung and her voice box in a cancer operation.
Sackman launched the anti-smoking campaign Tuesday, saying: "My tobacco  ads would have encouraged people to start smoking.
"Today, I hope that this TV commercial will help many more people give up  smoking and stop young people from starting to smoke."
Now a staunch anti-tobacco crusader, she said she had her first cigarette  as a Lucky Strike girl after an executive suggested it would make her more  convincing and authentic -- then smoked for 33 years.
She said no-one knew of the dangers of smoking then and in later years she  felt she was not harming herself because she did not inhale the smoke.
Quit Campaign executive director Michelle Scollo said the Don't Wait Until  It's Too Late theme was directed at smokers who wanted to give up but were  putting it off until a later date.
"We want to remind them that, unfortunately, eventually is sometimes too  late."
