Sepak takraw, a traditional village pastime that  has become one of southeast Asia's most popular sports, may make it to the  2000 Olympics in Sydney, the Bangkok Post reported Sunday.
International Olympic Committee (IOC) chief Juan Antonio Samaranch  suggested sepak takraw be included because of its acrobatic action and  exciting play, the Post quoted Thai Olympic official Santiparb Tejavanija as  saying.
"It's too early to make any predictions, but I feel that the chances are  good," Santiparb told the Post on his return from a meeting of the Olympic  Council of Asia (OCA) in Hiroshima. Santiparb is OCA treasurer.
Sepak takraw, which made its entry into international sport at the 1990  Asian Games in Beijing, is played on a badminton-sized court, divided by a  net, by two three-man teams.
The teams have to get a rattan ball from one side of the court to the  other, using any part of the body, except hands. It started as a traditional  village sport played in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Burma. Malaysia were  the first Asian Games champions.
Because of reluctance to add new sports to the packed Olympic lineup,  sepak takraw could be included under another name such as "acrobatic  volleyball," Santiparb said.
Santiparb also said four sports -- kabaddi, handball, women's football and  baseball -- were doubtful starters for the Hiroshima Asian Games starting  October 2 because they had failed to attract the minimum six countries.
A Games organising committee spokesman in Japan said he was unaware of any  threat to the events.
