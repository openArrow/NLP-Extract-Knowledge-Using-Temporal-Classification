A Russian aid convoy left Dar es Salaam Sunday en  route for Rwandan refugee camps in northwest Tanzania, Radio Russia said.
A BBC dispatch monitored here, quoted Russian radio as saying the convoy  comprised 10 trucks and three support vehicles.
The convoy's commander said its task was to deliver relief parcels to the  camps and that the trucks could carry a weight of more than 60 tonnes.
At least 300,000 Rwandans have fled their country for neighbouring  Tanzania since April 6, when Rwanda was plunged into an ethnic bloodbath which  aid agencies estimate has claimed up to 500,000 lives.
Most of the refugees are in the Benako camp near Ngara.
