Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the celebrated Russian  dissident writer expelled by the old Soviet regime, will return home by the  end of the month after 20 years in exile, his wife said in an interview  published Wednesday.
"We have always known that we would come back one day or another. The fate  of Alexander Solzhenitsyn must end on Russian soil," his wife Natalya Svetlova  told the Russian paper Izvestia.
She refused to state the exact day, saying her husband wanted to avoid  journalists and return quietly.
Solzhenitsyn, 75, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1970, was  stripped of his Soviet nationality and expelled from Russia on February 13,  1974, handcuffed and surrounded by KGB agents.
He will return from his home in exile in Vermont in the United States with  a Russian passport and settle in a big home in the Moscow suburbs on property  the Moscow city hall will rent to him.
