Mansell went on to five Indy-car triumphs and the series title last  season, but well remembers the one that got away.
"Last year I made some mistakes here and I'm not going to make any excuses  why they happened," Mansell said. "The strategy will be very much the same.  This time I'm more comfortable and aware of a lot more situations. I will try  to make sure I'm in good shape and get the first 400 miles out of the way,  then you really have to start charging and racing and go for it."
Mansell's Indy rookie of the year performance made most people forget he  ws injured just a month earlier in a crash at Phoenix in his first oval  effort.
"This year I can walk and it's so much better," Mansell said. "I have a  comfort level mentally and physically. After the accident on the first oval, a  lot of people said, 'I told you so.' To have the dogged determination to come  back and do well on the ovals showed a lot of people."
Despite four oval triumphs last year, Mansell does not feel he has the  circuits mastered.
"I'm still learning about the ovals," he said. "I haven't adapted really.  Oval racing is pure racing and I have always thought of myself as a racer. You  get in traffic and you have dogfights and I forget I'm on an oval."
Mansell has not forgotten what the ovals have meant to him, however.
"Winning the Indy-car championship had more impact than winning the  Formula One championship," he said. "I was runner-up three times basically  from 1986, so when we eventually did win Formula One, everyone was so  relieved. Winning here, everybody was more shocked and surprised."
