British author Salman Rushdie was presented with  the European prize for literature Monday by the Austrian Minister for  Education and Culture Rudolf Scholten.
The prize, which was awarded to Rushdie in 1992 and includes a cash prize  of 17,000 dollars, was handed over amid strict security at the ministry.
Rushdie has been living in hiding since he was condemned to death by the  late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini for allegedly blaspheming Islam in his  novel "The Satanic Verses."
The writer was emotional during the ceremony saying he had almost  forgotten what it was like to be in a room full of people discussing his work.
A jury of authors decided to award Rushdie the prize in 1992 but their  decision was kept secret for a year because Austrian authorities said they  could not ensure Rushdie's security in Vienna.
But public outrage and Rushdie's willingness to travel to Austria to  receive the prize forced the government to reconsider its position.
