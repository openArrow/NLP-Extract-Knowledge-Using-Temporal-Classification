As it is, one of his teammates, 27-year-old Claudio Caniggia, who like  Maradona has been <EVENT eid="e2" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">beset</EVENT> by problems off the field, is neither as quick nor as  fit as he was.&#13;
Yet only about a quarter of Argentina's expected squad of 22 are likely to  be younger than him&#13;
The Dutch, too, have some outstanding seasoned campaigners to <EVENT eid="e3" class="I_ACTION" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">call</EVENT> on,  such as the stars of their <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE">1988</TIMEX3> European Nations Cup <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">win</EVENT> -- <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION">32-year-old</TIMEX3> Ronald  Koeman and <TIMEX3 tid="t3" type="DURATION">31-year-old</TIMEX3> Frank Rijkaard plus PSV Eindhoven's Jan Wouters, 33 --  , all of whom have <EVENT eid="e5" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">shown</EVENT> outstanding form for their clubs.&#13;
Rijkaard <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">won</EVENT> his fourth Dutch title with Ajax <TIMEX3 tid="t4" type="DATE">this year</TIMEX3> and Koeman will  <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="FUTURE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">turn</EVENT> out for Barcelona against AC Milan in the European Champions Cup final on  <TIMEX3 tid="t5" type="DATE">May 18</TIMEX3>.&#13;
But the granddaddy of them all at USA '94 is likely to be Roger Milla, the  outstanding personality of the <TIMEX3 tid="t6" type="DATE">1990</TIMEX3> World Cup when his Cameroon team <EVENT eid="e8" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">battled</EVENT>  against all the odds to <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">reach</EVENT> the <TIMEX3 tid="t7" type="DATE">quarter-finals</TIMEX3>.&#13;
