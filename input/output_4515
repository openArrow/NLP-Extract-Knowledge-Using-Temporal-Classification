China has expelled a number of foreign journalists  for breaking reporting regulations, foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said  Friday.
"Several journalists violated regulations concerning news reporting so the  Chinese cut short their period of stay," he told a press conference.
Wu did not say how many had been expelled or give their nationalities, but  indicated that they included South Koreans and had been reporting in eastern  China.
The official news agency Xinhua reported that the group included a South  Korean, Kwon Heung-Soon, who works for the radio and television network Mon  Hwa Broadcasting Company (MBC).
The expulsion came eight days before the fifth anniversary of the bloody  crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
The runup to the anniversary has also seen the detention of several  non-accredited and accredited journalists in Beijing who have been accused of  conducting illegal interviews with dissidents.
Nine foreign journalists were detained for questioning in March and April  for having contacts with dissidents, and a five-member crew with the US  television network NBC was also briefly held on May 17.
