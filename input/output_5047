Olympic 100m champion Gail Devers  launched her 1994 athletics season with a victory Saturday, winning the 100m  at the Bruce Jenner Classic in a wind-aided 10.77 seconds.
Devers, The 1992 Olympic 100m champion and the 1993 world champion in the  100m and 100m hurdles, edged fellow American Carlette Guidry (10.97) and  Jamaican Juliet Cuthbert (11.04).
"I really didn't practice all last week and maybe that did me some good,"  said Devers, whose car was rear-ended while she waited at a traffic light on  May 17.
The wreck left her with a sore neck and back, forcing her to skip the New  York Games last weekend.
"I really wanted to run here," she said. "I wanted to run well. I wanted  to see where I am. It's going slowly, but I'm off to a good start and there's  plenty of room for improvement."
I the 100m hurdles, Jamaican Michelle Freeman took advantage of a mistake  by Jackie Joyner-Kersee to win in 12.74, one hundredth of a second in front of  the American.
"She fumbled it a bit and I took the lead," Freeman said. "At the wire, I  knew I had her."
Joyner-Kersee, who stumbled at the seventh hurdle, said: "I think it was  more mental than anything else. I have to concentrate better."
Joyner-Kersee easily won the long jump with a leap of 7.30m, ahead of  Australian Nicole Boegman with a jump of 6.76.
In men's events, American Andre Cason won the 100m in 10.01, with Jon  Drummond second in 10.06 and Daniel Effiong of Nigeria third in 10.10.
Effiong won the 200m in 20.10.
