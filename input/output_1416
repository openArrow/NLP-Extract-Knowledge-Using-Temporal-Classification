Four people were charged Tuesday with  serious public order offences after an attack by skinheads on a group of  Africans in the eastern German town of Magdeburg, the state prosecutor said.
A total of five people have now been charged over the fighting. A  19-year-old believed to be one of the ringleaders of the racist violence was  charged Monday.
Prosecutor Rudolf Jaspers said he had requested that four more people also  be charged, and two of these cases are due to be decided Wednesday.
Last Thursday, around 50 skinheads attacked a group of African people and  chased them through the town centre. They were joined in the chase by a group  of inebriated youths.
In the fighting which followed, five people were hurt, all of them among  the attackers.
The regional government in Magdeburg Tuesday expressed regret at the  police decision to release 49 people arrested Thursday "too soon and in an  undifferentiated fashion," its government spokesman Dietrich Pawlowski said.
However he added that the regional state authorities had expressed support  for the police action at the time of the riot, after some had criticised it as  lax.
The Magdeburg events are to be the subject of debate in the German  Bundestag, or lower chamber of the federal parliament, on Wednesday.
