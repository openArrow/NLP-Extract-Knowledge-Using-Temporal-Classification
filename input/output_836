Australian champions Adelaide City  hammered relegated English premier division side Sheffield United 3-0 here on  Sunday night.
City, who earlier this month retained their national title, took the lead  in the 18th minute when national team striker Carl Veart beat his man and  crossed for Bradley Hassell to push the ball home at the far post.
Three minutes before half time City made it 2-0 when Damien Mori raced  through the centre before setting up an unmarked Veart, who made no mistake  from 15 metres.
Three minutes from time veteran fullback Sergio Melta overlapped down the  right before crossing to the near post where Hassell deflected the ball past  United goalkeeper Bill Mercer.
Sheffield United manager Dave Bassett said he was impressed with a number  of City's players, singling out Hassell.
United, who won their opening match in Perth 2-0, have two more matches on  their Australian tour this week in Newcastle and against Australia's Olympic  team in Tweed Heads, New South Wales.
