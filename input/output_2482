MOSCOW, May 20 (AFP) - Russia and the European Union are close to sealing  a partnership agreement, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said here Friday.
France until now had been blocking such an accord.
The two sides were "very close to concluding" an agreement on the  partnership deal said Juppe, adding that he hoped a final accord would be  hammered out in time for signing when EU foreign ministers hold their June  12-13 summit.
France has until now been holding up a final deal, fearing cheap Russian  nuclear fuel imports into the union would undercut French-produced fuel.
Juppe, who held talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin and Defence Minister Pavel Grachev, said it "went without  saying" that Russia should have a special place" within NATO's Partnership for  Peace programme.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has offered closer military  cooperation with former Warsaw Pact states, while stopping short of offering  full membership.
Russia has claimed special status within such a programme to take account  of its former status as a superpower.
