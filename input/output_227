Israeli intelligence chief
JERUSALEM, May 13 (AFP) - The PLO will need support if the peace process  is to succeed, the head of Israeli military intelligence Uri Saguy said in an  interview published Friday.
Saguy told the right-wing daily Maariv that "backing the PLO is a  necessary condition for the success of the peace process."
He warned that radical and Moslem fundamentalist groups opposed to the  peace process were likely to step up their attacks on Jerusalem and the West  Bank, as well as "inside Israeli territory."
But in the newly autonomous Gaza Strip, "terrorist attacks will go down or  at least will come up against PLO opposition."
He warned however that supporting the Palestine Liberation Organisation  could "whet the appetite of this organisation and its demands for the creation  of a Palestinian state."
