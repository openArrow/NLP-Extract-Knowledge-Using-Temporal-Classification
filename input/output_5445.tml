<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><TimeML><TIMEX3 tid="t0" functionInDocument="CREATION_TIME"/>The 6'2" (1.88m) Dreekmann is <EVENT eid="e1" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">built</EVENT> like Becker but there the resemblance  <EVENT eid="e2" class="ASPECTUAL" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">ends</EVENT>. Unlike Becker, Stich and Goellner, the latest German star is happier  rallying from the baseline than <EVENT eid="e3" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">charging</EVENT> to the net.&#13;
"I have been <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE_PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">playing</EVENT> on clay since I was seven years old," he <EVENT eid="e5" class="I_ACTION" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">explains</EVENT>.&#13;
The key to his victory over the experienced Krickstein was his intelligent  <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">changes</EVENT> of pace and clever drop shots but he is not about to <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="NEG" modality="none">boast</EVENT> about his  tactical sense.&#13;
"It just comes out," he <EVENT eid="e8" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT>. "I try something and if that works I <EVENT eid="e9" class="ASPECTUAL" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">keep</EVENT>  <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">doing</EVENT> it. If it doesn't, I <EVENT eid="e11" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="NEG" modality="none">change</EVENT>."&#13;
Krickstein was more forthcoming. "He looks very noncholant out there. But  he has <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">got</EVENT> a pretty good disguise on his forehand and he is capable of <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">hitting</EVENT>  some big shots.&#13;
"He doesn't <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="NEG" modality="none">look</EVENT> like a great player but he is young and in <TIMEX3 tid="t1" type="DATE">the quarter</TIMEX3>  finals of a grand slam, so he must be <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="must">doing</EVENT> something right."&#13;
Despite his surprise at having come so far so soon, Dreekmann never  <EVENT eid="e16" class="I_ACTION" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="NEG" modality="none">doubted</EVENT> that he would <EVENT eid="e17" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="would">make</EVENT> it to the top.&#13;
"I've always <EVENT eid="e18" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">thought</EVENT> I was <EVENT eid="e19" class="STATE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">good</EVENT> enough," he <EVENT eid="e20" class="REPORTING" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">says</EVENT> in response to questions  about the business studies he is <EVENT eid="e21" class="I_ACTION" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">trying</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">combine</EVENT> with a life on the tour.&#13;
