The Philippine Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered the  government to allow a private conference on human rights abuses in East Timor  to go ahead, striking down a lower court ban, officials said.
The high courty ordered the lower court to "cease and desist from  enforcing or implementing" its order to ban the conference, which has sparked  threats of retaliation from Indonesia. Jakarta annexed the former Portuguese  territory in 1976.
But the high court upheld Philippine President Fidel Ramos' authority to  expel foreigners in the name of national interest. Manila has expelled 10  foreign participants to the Tuesday to Friday meeting, citing Ramos' opinion  that their presence here would be "inimical to the national interest."
Rousing applause greeted the decision. Participants gathered at the  state-run University of the Philippines in suburban Manila at midday for the  beginning of the conference around 2:00 p.m. (0600 GMT).
The decision is a setback to Ramos' efforts to appease Jakarta, which is  acting as go-between in Manila's peace talks with Moslem guerrillas in the  country's southern islands.
"Nothing in this resolution should be interpreted as impairing the  constitutional and statutory authority of the president of the Philippines to  exclude aliens from entering the Philippines when demanded by national  interest and national security," the Supreme Court resolution said.
