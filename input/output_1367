A new Dutch parliament was sworn in Tuesday  following legislative elections two weeks ago, and MPs re-elected Christian  Democrat Wim Deetman as speaker.
A total of 58 new MPs were among the 150 sworn in Tuesday.
The Labour Party dropped 12 seats to 37 in the elections with the  Christian Democrats down 20 to 34, the VVD rightwing liberals up nine to 31  and the D66 leftwing liberals up 12 to 24.
Three small Protestant parties rose by one seat to seven, senior citizens  parties' won seven seats, the Green-Left party fell one seat to five, the  extreme-right rose two to three and the far-left SP won two seats.
The ceremony appeared most moving for Sharon Dijksma, leader of the Young  Labour, who at 23 became the youngest person ever elected a deputy in the  country.
After an agreement from the main parties, Deetman was re-elected speaker  with 137 votes out of 140 cast, breaking a tradition that the largest party in  the chamber provide the person for the post.
Labor, which took over from the Christian Democrats as the largest party  in the chamber, already has one of its nominees, Herman Tjeenk Willink,  installed as speaker in the senate.
Outside the chamber, demonstrators from the Dutch Auschwitz Committee  protested against the presence of three far-right MPs.
The ceremony was broadcast live in the Netherlands for the first time.
