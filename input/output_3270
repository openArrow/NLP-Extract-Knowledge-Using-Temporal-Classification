Six UN disarmament experts travelled to Iraq on  Monday for a week-long mission to monitor ballistic missiles, a UN official  here said.
The official at the Bahrain-based UN commission for disarming post-war  Iraq said the experts would set up a "technical reference baseline" for Iraqi  missile systems.
The team led by Guy Martelle, a US national, would also check the missile  works' areas in Iraq and prepare for a mission in early June to tag missiles.
Iraq is banned from having missiles with a range of more 150 kilometers  (90 miles), under the UN ceasefire terms for the 1991 Gulf war.
Meanwhile, a 10-member chemical team arrived here on Monday and was set to  visit Baghdad two days later to help set up a system of long-term monitoring,  the official said.
"The team mission is to design the technical measures necessary to control  general chemical plants," he said. "The team will visit a number of sites and  hold talks with Iraqi officials about technical matters."
Headed by a Briton, Ron Godfrey, it will stay 10 days in Iraq.
