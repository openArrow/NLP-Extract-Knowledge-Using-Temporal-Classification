President Bill Clinton has asked Britain to  allow the US Coast Guard to use British Caribbean territories to process  asylum claims by thousands of Haitians, a newspaper report said Wednesday.
The White House would only confirm that Clinton and Prime Minister John  Major had talked about Haiti on the telephone, without saying what they  discussed.
However, White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said Tuesday that the  United States was negotiating with "a number of countries in the region about  third-country processing and some countries that are not in the region about  accepting additional refugees."
Clinton asked Major whether the Turks and Caicos Islands could be used as  processing centers for Haitians fleeing their desperately poor, unstable  country, The Washington Post said.
The Post said the United States wanted to consider the asylum claims on  board ships anchored off the islands, not on the islands themselves.
The Turks and Caicos are British dependencies. Only six islands in the  archipelago of about 30 islands southeast off the Bahamas are inhabited.
If no country offers to allow its territory to be used as a staging ground  for the operation, immigration processing will be carried out on chartered  cruise liners, US officials told the Post.
Clinton bowed to pressure from human rights groups May 8 and decided to  give fleeing Haitians immigration hearings before turning back those not  considered political refugees, reversing a two-year-old US policy of immediate  repatriation.
A growing number of Haitians have risked sailing to US shores in rickety  boats since the 1991 toppling of president Jean-Bertrand Aristide in a  military coup.
