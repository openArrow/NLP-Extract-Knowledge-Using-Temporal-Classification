President Boris Yeltsin told Russian  counterespionage agents Thursday to take decisive measures against extremists  who want to overthrow the government, Interfax reported.
In an address to the reformed KGB, Yeltsin said that "certain parties,  movements and social groups in Russia are resorting to illegal means for their  battles.
Such groupings "do not always receive an adequate rebuff," he added.
Yeltsin stressed that the security organ had an important role to play in  "defending the constitutional order" and said that every appeal aimed at  destabilising the current regime constituted a blow to the Russian state.
"The counterintelligence service must always have preventive information  on potential threats to state security," he said.
Yeltsin added that these measures should not attempt to control the  thoughts and actions of citizens but rather to seek out information and  prevent "anti-constitutional" actions.
