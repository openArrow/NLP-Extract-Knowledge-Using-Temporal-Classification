The North Korean nuclear crisis deepened  Friday as talks on monitoring the removal of fuel rods at a nuclear site  apparently ended in failure, diplomatic sources said.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and North Korea were trying  to agree conditions for checking the removal of fuel rods from a reactor at  Yongbyon.
But a senior administration official in Washington said "we understand the  talks did not produce any agreement." The official said he understood there  were no plans to resume the talks in Pyongyang.
North Korea is continuing to remove the used rods, diplomatic sources here  said.
IAEA director general Hans Blix is likely to provide a report on the  problem to the UN Security Council later Friday or early Saturday at the  latest, they added.
According to reports circulating here, North Korea has speeded up the  discharge of the spent fuel rods and the operation could be completed by  Tuesday.
The IAEA says it must be able to set its own conditions to monitor the  discharge of the rods from the five-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon in order to  ascertain whether any plutonium has been diverted.
North Korea has blocked full international inspections of its nuclear  facilities for more than a year, sparking fears that it is developing nuclear  weapons.
The United States hopes the Security Council can discuss the issue late  Friday or early Saturday, diplomats said.
The five permanent Council members (Britain, France, the United States,  China and Russia) have already held intensive talks after an informal session  between US and North Korean representatives in New York on Thursday.
The Security Council could discuss a statement, or even a resolution,  demanding that Pyongyang stop discharging the reactor or face Security Council  action, presumably sanctions.
