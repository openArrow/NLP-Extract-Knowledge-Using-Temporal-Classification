The Philippines Saturday expelled a Nobel peace  prize winner from Northern Ireland, Mairead Maguire, who defied a ban on  foreigners attending an outlawed international human rights conference on East  Timor.
Maguire, 50, who won the Nobel prize in 1976, and her companion Tom  Hyland, were ordered to board the same KLM jet that took them to the  Philippines from Europe late Saturday. Its final destination was Amsterdam.
They were the first foreigners deported by Manila under the ban, issued  last week by President Fidel Ramos following a diplomatic crisis with  neighboring Indonesia over the conference.
A Manila court also issued Friday a restraining order banning organizers  from going ahead with the planned May 31-June 3 meeting, but left-wing  Philippine groups vowed to push through the conference.
Human rights groups accuse Indonesian troops of widespread human rights  abuses in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony annexed by Jakarta in 1975.
Before being deported, Maguire told AFP in a telephone interview from an  airport detention office that they were aware of the ban but flew to Manila to  express solidarity with the people of East Timor.
Maguire shared the Nobel Peace Prize under her maiden name Mairead  Corrigan in 1976 with Betty Williams for spearheading a peace movement in  Northern Ireland.
"We are deeply concerned with the people of East Timor, where at least one  third were killed by the Indonesian forces," she charged. "We call on all  people to support the people of East Timor."
"We were aware that we would be deported but we tried to go to the  conference. We decided that we would come because we feel the need for  solidarity with the suffering people of East Timor," she added.
