Japan confirmed Wednesday that North Korea fired an  improved version of a "Silkworm" anti-ship missile into the Sea of Japan.
The missile was launched Tuesday from the North Korean port of Wonsan,  according to Japanese governement sources quoted by the Japanese public  radio-television channel NHK.
"I heard it was true," Chief cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai told  reporters. "It looks like it was not a test launch of a ballistic missile."
The Chinese-designed "Silkworm" missile has a range of approximately 85  kilometres (53 miles).
American television networks NBC and ABC earlier reported the North Korean  missile launch on their evening news programs Tuesday but gave no further  details.
However, sources at the Japanese Defense Agency quoted by Kyodo News  Service said the latest missile launch was a routine test.
This missile was launched as North Korea is facing a stand-off with the  International Atomic Energy Agency over inspection of its nuclear facilities.
