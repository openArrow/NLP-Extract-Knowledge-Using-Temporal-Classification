Ugandan fishermen are being paid to help stop  thousands of bodies from ethnic massacres in Rwanda from floating into Lake  Victoria, officials said Thursday.
Ugandan authorities and charity organisations have provided the fishermen  on Lake Victoria with strong nets to help them trap the floating corpses at a  narrow bend on the Kagera river before it enters the lake.
They are then being paid two US dollars for each body recovered and  buried, in a move aimed at decreasing the pollution of the lake itself, which  borders on Uganda. The Kagera river links Rwanda to the lake.
"It is easier here, than collecting them from the massive waters of the  lake, whose tides are unpredictable", said Emmanuel Pinto, chairman of the  disaster committee and member of Uganda's interim parliament, the National  Resistance Council (NRC).
"We have to do this for a quicker clean-up of our waters, if we are ever  to go back to our fishing business," added John Migaddo who depends on money  from the fishing industry.
Ethnic bloodletting in Rwanda has left hundreds of thousands of dead since  last month. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has confirmed that there are  some 50,000 bodies floating on Lake Victoria, some of them having submerged  for more than 150 kilometres before surfacing down at the mouth of the river.
Some of them had only been killed 48 hours earlier, WHO pointed out,  adding that there were still no signs of water contamination over and beyond  the normal level on the Tanzanian and Ugandan coastlines.
