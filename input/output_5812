Japan will send a mission to Canada to discuss  cooperation in peacekeeping activities on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights,  officials said Tuesday.
The dispatch of the six-member mission follows a United Nations request  for Japan to study the possibility of helping Canadian peacekeepers on the  Golan Heights, they said.
Japan is to make a decision on whether it should send self-defense force  members to the heights after consultations with Canada, government officials  said.
The mission is to leave Saturday for Canada and return home June 11.
Currently, United Nations Disengagement Observer Forces comprising 464  people from Austria, 357 from Poland and 215 from Canada are engaged in  peacekeeping activities on the Golan Heights.
The heights have been occupied by Israel since it seized the territory  from Syria in 1967.
Under a law enacted in 1992 allowing the dispatch of non-combatant  military personnel overseas, Japan has sent military engineers to Cambodia and  Mozambique.
Japan's pacifist constitution, promulgated after World War II, prohibits  the country from sending troops overseas to settle international disputes.
