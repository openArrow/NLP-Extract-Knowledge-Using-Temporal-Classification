Japanese consumer electronics giant Sony Corp. said  Thursday its consolidated pre-tax earnings rose 10 percent from a year earlier  to 102 billion yen (990 million dollars) in the year to March.
But the company, which has been adversely affected by the strong yen, said  worldwide sales slipped seven percent to 3.73 trillion yen in the same period.
Sony forecast sharply higher group earnings of 125 billion yen for the  current year with sales climbing to 3.99 trillion yen.
