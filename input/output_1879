Japanese trading company Marubeni Corp. said  Thursday its pre-tax earnings climbed 10 percent from a year earlier to 41.1  billion yen (400 million dollars) in the year to March.
But the Osaka-based affiliate of Fuji Bank Ltd. said sales dropped 10.1  percent to 15,156 billion yen in the same period, depressed by reduced revenue  from all areas except domestic trading.
Marubeni forecast lower earnings of 38 billion yen for the current year on  increased sales of 15,500 billion yen.
