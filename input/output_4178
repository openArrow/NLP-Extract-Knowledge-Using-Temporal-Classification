Charges flew back and forth during an overnight  Pakistani Senate debate of alleged ruling party member and opposition leader  involvement in a multi-million-dollar banking scandal here.
The former chief operating officer of the private Mehran Bank, Younus  Habib, has been jailed on charges of embezzling huge sums and doling out money  to friends, including prominent politicians and a former army chief.
Interior Ministr Nasreeullah Babar told the senate that Habib  misappropriated 2,100 million rupees (70 million dollars) plus 36.7 million  dollars from the sales of Foreign Exchange Bearer Certificates.
He said the beneficiaries of Habib's "generosity" included ex-prime  minister Nawaz Sharif, now the main opposition leader, former army chief  general Mirza Aslam Beg, two former provincial chief ministers and other  politicians.
Babar said the former Mehran Bank official, who extended big loans without  proper guarantees, had acquired property worth more than 130 million dollars  in Islamabad and the nearby hill resort of Murree.
The bank, established in 1991, ran into trouble last year after state  establishments tried to close their accounts. The central bank intervened,  dismissing Habib and charging him with fraud.
While most of the alleged wrong-doers mentioned by the interior minister  belong to the opposition, the opposition members accuse high officials in the  government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of involvement in the scandal.
Officials said the government would set up a panel of judges this weekend  to investigate.
