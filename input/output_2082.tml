The top 40 clubs <EVENT eid="e3" class="REPORTING" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">say</EVENT> they are being <EVENT eid="e4" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">frozen</EVENT> out in the restructuring of the  union and are <EVENT eid="e5" class="I_ACTION" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">threatening</EVENT> a boycott.&#13;
They <EVENT eid="e6" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">believe</EVENT> that they should have eight seats on the 56-strong council  and two on the 19-man executive.&#13;
All they have been <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">offered</EVENT> is two seats on the council, which is not the  policy-making body.&#13;
Frank Gibbon, chairman of the Senior Clubs Association, <EVENT eid="e8" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT>: "We are  dismayed that what is being <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PROGRESSIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">offered</EVENT> is fewer than the three seats each being  <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">provided</EVENT> for both students and the services.&#13;
"We <EVENT eid="e11" class="I_STATE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">believe</EVENT> the SCA's relevance is sufficient to <EVENT eid="e12" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">justify</EVENT> having two seats  on the RFU executive committee.&#13;
"If this cannot be <EVENT eid="e13" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="NONE" aspect="NONE" polarity="NEG" modality="can">achieved</EVENT>, we will not be <EVENT eid="e14" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="FUTURE" aspect="NONE" polarity="NEG" modality="none">prepared</EVENT> to <EVENT eid="e15" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">take</EVENT> up the two  council seats."&#13;
