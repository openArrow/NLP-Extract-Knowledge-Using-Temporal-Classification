The Non-Alignment Movement (NAM), which groups 110  developing countries, will discuss the nomination of a new country to chair  the group in Egypt later this month, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Tuesday.
Alatas said after meeting with President Suharto that he would attend the  NAM ministerial meeting in Egypt from May 31 to June 3 to discuss which  country will host the next summit. The host automatically chairs the movement.
Alatas said it was still unclear who would chair the NAM, but Latin  American countries have been lobbying for the position since it last hosted  the summit  in 1979, in Cuba.
Indonesia has indicated that it does not want to hold the chairmanship for  a second term after its current one ends in September next year.
According to a NAM diplomat, Indonesia would be ready to extend its  chairmanship for six months or one year if there was a deadlock on the  election of the new leader.
"It seems that Nicaragua, which in 1991 indicated its willingness to hold  the chairmanship of NAM, will definitely not be able to handle the task, as  the country mentioned financial difficulties," the diplomat said.
Indonesia hosted the 10th summit in September 1992 and is the current  chairman of the movement.
The Cairo-meeting will be the NAM's usual mid-term ministerial session.
