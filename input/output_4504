A man who killed a police officer who  caught him having sex in a car in 1981 was executed by lethal injection here  early Friday.
Stephen Nethery, 33, was the 77th Texas inmate and the 241st nationwide to  have been put to death since the US Supreme Court allowed states to resume  using the death penalty in 1976.
Another convicted murderer was scheduled to hang later Friday in  Washington state.
Nethery was put to death shortly after midnight and only hours after the  Supreme Court rejected a stay of execution.
"Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. Amen," Nethery said at the end of a short  prayer in which he asked that others pray for his family and the family of his  victim.
He was then strapped to a bed and administered the lethal injection.
Nethery was convicted of killing a police officer who found him having sex  with a woman in a car beside a lake near Dallas. The woman claimed she was  raped but Nethery was not prosecuted on that charge.
In their appeals, his lawyers argued that the jury was not allowed to  consider that Nathery was drunk and under the influence of marijuana when he  committed the murder.
In Walla Walla, Washington, Charles Rodman Campbell, 39, was awaiting  execution by hanging for knifing two women and an eight-year-old girl to death  in 1982.
One of the women had been raped eight years earlier by Campbell, who was  on a work-release program when he slashed the throats of his former victim,  her daughter and a neigbor. The girl was nearly beheaded.
The Supreme Court rejected a last minute appeal by Campbell's lawyers that  maintained, among other things, that hanging was cruel and unusual punishment.
