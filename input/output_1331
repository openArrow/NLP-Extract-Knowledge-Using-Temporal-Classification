Mozambique's government has finally ended a  month-long moratorium on demobilising its troops under a peace accord with the  Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO), UN peacekeeping sources said Tuesday.
Chief of the UN technical unit for demobilisation Ton Pardoel confirmed  that the government broke its embargo by discharging 571 soldiers from Angoche  and Chimoio, in northern and central Mozambique, on Monday.
The rest of this week will be spent trying to catch up with lost time in  the demobilisation process, due to end by mid-July according to the latest  resolution of the UN Security Council, whose peacekeeping mandate for  Mozambique ends in November.
Government suspended demobilisation from April 20, claiming both that  former RENAMO rebels was not demobilising fast enough and that its own  programme needed checking as some soldiers selected for a joint new national  army were being demobbed by mistake.
Western political observers interpreted the moratorium as government  hesitation over giving up its more strategic forces.
Pardoel told AFP that 190 government soldiers would be demobilised Tuesday  and a further 1,570 by the end of the week, while RENAMO should discharge  another 186 of its former guerrilla fighters on Wednesday.
This will bring the total number of demobilised soldiers to 18,222, of  which some 16,000 are from the government's side, out of  its newly declared  total force of 49,000 to be demobilised from assembly centers.
RENAMO is only expected to demobilise 4,000 men from its much smaller  force, with its remaining 15,000 due to join the combined new national army.
However, the size of the new army is currently in question as the nation  now lacks both time and resources to train a planned 30,000 soldiers ahead of  general elections marked for October.
