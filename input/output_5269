South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-Joo summoned  the ambassadors of the United States, Japan, Russia and China on Monday for  urgent consultations on the North Korean nuclear standoff.
Foreign ministry officials said Han began the consultations by first  meeting with US Ambassador James Laney shortly after 11:00 a.m. (0240 GMT) at  the request of President Kim Young-Sam.
The meeting followed an inter-ministerial coordination meeting at the  presidential palace.
It also came one day ahead of an expected UN Security Council meeting to  ill discuss possibile sanctions on North Korea following its refusal to allow  International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors to monitor the removal of spent  fuel rods from a five-megawatt reactor.
The United States believes North Korea may have diverted weapons-grade  material from the rods in past years and says the checks are essential to  determine whether the isolated state has embarked on a nuclear weapons  program.
