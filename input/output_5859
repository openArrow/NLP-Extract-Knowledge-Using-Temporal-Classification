But Courier was in no mood to surrender in an event played on what he  considers very much his own territory.
The 23-year-old American, champion in 1991 and 1992 and still under the  wing of crafty Spanish coach Jose Higueras, kept Sampras back with his  baseline slogging and the world number-one was not helped by his serve.  Although he hammered down ten aces, he also hit as many double-faults.
Courier, who looked the fresher of the two, made a vital move when he  broke Sampras for a fifth and final time in the seventh game of the fourth  set. And he poured salt on Sampras' wounds by immediately holding his own  serve to love.
There was no way back for Sampras.
Asked about his failure to complete the feat of winning a fourth  consecutive Grand Slam, Sampras shook his head sadly: "I don't know what to  think right now. I feel very down and disappointed.
"To win four in a row would have been something that would have been  written about for a long time to come.
Sampras' great idol Rod Laver of Australia was the last player to complete  the 'Grand Slam' (the four major titles in the same year) in 1969.
"This was a pretty good win for my head. It's been a long time since I  beat the number-one player in the world in a big match," said Courier.
"I think the real turning point came in the third set when I managed to  break him after he was 40-15 up and serving."
Courier said he didn't want to get "over-excited" by his victory.
"It feels fantastic -- but there are more matches to come," he said.
Medvedev paid a warm tribute to Bruguera, who has yet to lose a set in  this year's tournament.
"He was the best player out there today," he said, adding: "But I have  time. I shall be back."
