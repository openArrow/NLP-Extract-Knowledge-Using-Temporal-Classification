The European Union is to impose quotas on the  volume of imported garlic from China, EU Agricultural Commissioner Rene  Steichen said here Monday.
He said that imports of the Chinese garlic would be limited to 10,000  tonnes over the 12 month period ending on May 31 next year, and to 5,000  tonnes over the next three months to August 31.
Steichen said the livelihoods of 50,000 families in the EU were threatened  by a surge of garlic imports from China over the last two years.
The imports totalled 21,951 tonnes over the first 11 months of 1993 -- 121  percent higher than the same period in 1992 and 254 percent higher than the  equivalent annual average between 1988 and 1990.
