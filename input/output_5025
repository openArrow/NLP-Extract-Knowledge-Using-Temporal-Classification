Russian police have found a 53-year-old man who has  spent the past 30 years squatting in the pitch-black cellar of his mother's  house, press reports said Saturday.
The man survived on pieces of food passed to him by his 80-year-old mother  through a tiny vent in her house at Saratov, in southeastern Russia.
Police found the man in the cellar by chance when they called on the woman  to ask her to move out because the boiler was badly damaged and had been  belching out smoke for several days.
The man was incapable of walking or speaking and was a virtual skeleton,  ITAR-TASS quoted a local paper as saying.
His mother told police her son had been a normal child, but "suddenly  stopped speaking. He started avoiding people and then shut himself in the  alcove and refused to come out."
