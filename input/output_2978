Vice President Al Gore said Sunday that there  had been some progress in the dialogue with North Korea and that the process  was worth pursuing.
Gore's comments in an interview with CBS television came a day after North  Korean officials agreed to meet with the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) to discuss plans for monitoring refueling of its Yongbyon nuclear  reactor.
The IAEA has been seeking permission to inspect North Korean nuclear  facilities because of suspicions that Pyongyang is secretly building nuclear  weapons.
"We have laid out certain conditions at each step of the dialogue that  we're having with North Korea and at each stage of this discussion there has  been some advance in the dialogue," Gore said.
Gore acknowledged the effort to engage North Korea was "a risky endeavour"  but said the risks were less if the dialogue were continued.
"We are not irrevocably locked into dialogue alone, but we believe that  right now, this process continues to bear some fruit and is worth pursuing,"  he said.
Gore rejected a suggestion that the North Koreans questioned US resolve.
"America has proven for many decades now our collective resolve to defend  South Korea and we will continue to do that. And I don't think the North  Koreans have any reason whatsoever to doubt that," he said.
