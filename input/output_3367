Maradona's incredible story began at Argentinos Juniors, the club that  first realised that a tiny frame and a deformed right leg were not going to  deny Diego Armando a career in football.
By the age of 16, he was already attracting nationwide interest. He  narrowly failed to make the 1978 World Cup squad but by the time he moved to  Boca Juniors in 1981 he was an established international.
He travelled to Spain in 1982 having already signed a world record  transfer deal to play for Barcelona.
But his World Cup debut and his time with Barcelona proved a Spnish  nightmare. Second round defeats by Italy and Brazil ended Argentina's defence  of their crown and Maradona, who had been brutally marked out of the Italy  match by Claudio Gentile, vented his frustration against Brazil in the next  game with a wild hack that earned him a red card.
Spanish league referees offered no more protection and Maradona's  Barcelona career effectively came to an end when Andoni Goicochea -- the  Butcher of Bilbao -- scythed through his leg in one of football's most  notorious fouls.
An eight million dollar move to Napoli -- another world record -- brought  happier times but also laid the basis for the blackest period of his career.
The season after his Mexican triumph, Maradona guided Napoli to their  first ever Italian league title. It has since been alleged, by his former  bodyguard, that Napoli's failure to retain their title was due to Maradona's  involvement with the Neapolitan mafia, although that has not affected his  status as a hero in the city.
Maradona delivered another league title to Napoli in 1990 but by the time  of the 1990 World Cup, the signs that he was having difficulty living with the  pressure were all too clear.
