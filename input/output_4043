The 10-member Southern African Development  Community (SADC) is to invite South Africa to join the economic grouping, it  was announced here Wednesday.
SADC executive secretary Kaire Mbuende told journalists that he would  deliver a letter to President Nelson Mandela this week inviting South Africa  to apply to become SADC's eleventh member.
SADC, comprising Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia,  Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabawe, was formed as a "co-operation  conference" 13 years ago in a bid to counter the economic influence of South  Africa's former apartheid regime in the southern Africa region.
It was renamed a community at a summit in Windhoek in 1992.
Mbuende said he was confident South Africa would be admitted to the  community at the next SADC summit in Tanzania on August 29.
In a state of the nation address to parliament in Cape Town on Tuesday,  Mandela said South Africa was keen to enter into trade negotiations with SADC  members states.
Mbuende moved to allay fears that economically-powerful South Africa would  dominate the grouping at the expense of smaller SADC member states.
"SADC will benefit more from a richer South Africa than it would from a  poor South Africa," he said.
