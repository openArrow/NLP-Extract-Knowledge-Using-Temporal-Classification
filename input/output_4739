The Italian-based Alfa Romeo team is considering  its future in the British Touring car championships after losing an appeal  against disqualifications.
Alfa Romeo had their points withdrawn for races they won at Snetterton and  Silverstone, because of infringements related to the position of front  spoilers on their cars.
The British Motor Sports Council upheld the disqualifications on Friday  and Alfa Romeo are expected to make an announcement on their future plans  before the race at Oulton Park, Cheshire on Monday.
