Hanan Ashrawi, former Palestinian  spokeswoman to Middle East peace talks, said Sunday she was sticking to her  decision to refuse a post in the Palestinian Authority for self-rule.
"I said I wasn't going to take part and I have not changed my mind," she  told AFP on her return to Ramallah in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
She took part in the first formal meeting of the authority at the PLO's  headquarters in Tunis where it adopted a political programme Saturday for the  running of the newly-autonomous areas of Gaza and Jericho.
"I went to the meeting to help put together a programme for the  Palestinian Authority and that is what I did. But my aim is to work with the  organisation for human rights," she added.
Ashrawi has for several months headed a Palestinian commission on human  rights.
