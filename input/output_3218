Owners of tankers calling at Yemeni ports must  begin paying higher premiums to cover war risks, the Cyprus-based Middle East  Economic Survey said Monday.
The Institute of London Underwriters, Lloyd's Underwriters Association and  Norwegian Underwriters notified marine insurance customers on May 10 that all  Yemen ports are part of "war risk excluded areas" effective May 17, MEES said.
The notice came five days after civil war broke out between northern and  southern Yemen.
Shipowners wishing to load crude at the southern terminal at Ash Shihr are  being quoted net additional premiums between 0.125 and 0.20 percent, and from  0.25 to 0.50 percent for the northern terminal of Ras Issa, MEES said.
Tanker operators wishing to load or discharge at the Aden refinery are  being quoted higher risk premiums of 0.75 to 1.0 percent, as this port is  located much closer to the actual fighting than the two others, MEES said.
For a standard 1970-built VLCC worth 15 million to 20 million dollars of  war risk insurance, the Yemen war premiums represent 18,750 to 40,000 dollars  per voyage to Ash-Shihr, and 37,500 to 100,000 dollars to Ras Issa.
Higher war risk charges are required for newer vessels, since these are  insured at values reaching 90 to 120 million dollars, the specialist  newsletter said.
"Under the extraordinary terms, war risk insurance is reinstated on a  case-by-case basis with insurers assessing additional premiums a maximum of 48  hours in advance of each port call" not to exceed seven days, it said.
So far no oil facilities have been damaged and crude oil production and  exports activities have continued "more or less normally," according to MEES.
However, the northern authorities in Sanaa, who used to process 55,000  barrels per day (bpd) of Marib crude at the south's Aden refinery for domestic  consumption, must now sell it on the spot market at a discount of 25 cents for  May and June, MEES said.
Another result of the war is a shortage of petroleum products in the north  which must rely on the 10,000 bpd topping plant in Maarib -- far below  estimated needs of 40,000 bpd.
