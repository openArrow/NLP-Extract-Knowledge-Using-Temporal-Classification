The mostly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF)  Sunday seized the government-held Camp Kanombe barracks near Kigali airport  which they had captured earlier in the day, UN officials announced.
Hundreds of people fled the camp after the rebels had taken the airport  following days of intense shelling. The barracks accommodated up to 4,000  government troops until recently and were the biggest in the Rwandan capital,  according to a UN estimate.
UN spokesman Abdul Kabia earlier announced by telephone in Rwanda that the  airport, where 200 Ghanaian UN troops are stationed, fell to the RPF at about  6.00 a.m. (0400 GMT) with no casualties reported.
"The RPF soldiers are everywhere, in the buildings, on the runway," one  military source said.
