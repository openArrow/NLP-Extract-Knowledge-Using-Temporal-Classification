The World Bank approved Friday a loan of 30  million dollars to the West Bank and Gaza Strip to help fund emergency  infrastructure projects, officials said.
The credit, approved from the World Bank's trust fund for Gaza, is the  first in a series of loans to fund the 128-million-dollar Emergency  Rehabilitation Project. It is also being financed by the Arab Fund and several  countries.
The three-year loan is aimed at financing improvement of infrastructural  services in education, power, water and sanitation, and roads in the Occupied  Territories.
The emergency loan earmarks 20.5 million dollars for schools, 10 million  dollars for the power system, 39.4 million dollars for water and sewage  projects, and 50 million dollars for roads.
"The project will aim to deliver widespread and tangible benefits to broad  sections of the Palestinian population as quickly, equitably and effectively  as possible," said World Bank Middle East Director Ram Chopra.
Improvements may be seen within a year, Chopra said in a statement.
The Emergency Rehabilitation Project is part of a three-year,  1.2-billion-dollar Palestinian assistance plan coordinated by the World Bank.
