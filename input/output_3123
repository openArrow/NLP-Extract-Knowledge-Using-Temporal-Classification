Rwanda's army and rebels began a truce Monday,  after a night of fighting, for the visit of a special UN envoy who is to  prepare the ground for the planned arrival of thousands of peacekeeping  troops, UN officials said.
"We haven't heard gunfire all morning," said a UN official contacted by  telephone in Kigali.
Both sides pledged to observe a two-day truce starting Monday to allow  special envoy Iqbal Riza, expected in Kigali later Monday, to open discussions  with rebels and Rwanda's interim government, holed up in Gitarama, 40  kilometres (25 miles) southwest of the embattled capital, UN spokesman Abdul  Kabia said.
The truce brought calm to Kigali after a night of heavy shelling following  the capture of Kigali airport and a big army base by the rebels Sunday.
The capture of Kanombe barracks, Kigali's most heavily fortified army  position, was seen by military analysts as the biggest achievement by the  rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) in six weeks of fighting since the April 6  death of president Juvenal Habyarimana threw Rwanda into turmoil.
RPF secretary-general Theogene Rudasingwa, however, said there was no  truce, but pledged that rebel guerrillas would "hold fire as much as possible"  to allow Riza to travel safely.
Rudasingwa told a news conference in Nairobi that reports by UN officials  that both sides had agreed to a 48-hour truce were "exaggerated."
Up to half a million people, mostly members of the minority Tutsi tribe  that dominates the RPF, and Hutu opposition supporters, have been butchered in  a six-week-old bloodbath. Extremist Hutu militias have been blamed for much of  the killing.
Riza, the personal representative of UN Secretary-General Boutros  Boutros-Ghali, was due to arrive in Kigali by road from Uganda later Monday  for talks with both sides about plans to boost the number of UN soldiers in  Rwanda from 400 to 5,500 to end massacres of civilians and help displaced  people.
The Security Council authorised the deployment after the United Nations  came under heavy criticism for withdrawing most of its 2,500 ceasefire  monitors as bloodletting engulfed the small central African country last month.
