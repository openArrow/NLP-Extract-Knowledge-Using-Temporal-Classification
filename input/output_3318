Italian Interior Minister Roberto Maroni  Monday laid a wreath at the roadside spot where anti-Mafia judge Giovanni  Falcone was killed by a bomb blast here in 1992.
Falcone and his wife were both killed in the explosion along with three  bodyguards travelling in an escort vehicle.
Thousands of people demonstrated in Palermo and crowds gathered close to a  tree planted at the spot where the bomb exploded, observing a minute of  silence at two minutes to six -- the time the bomb exploded.
Falcone's sister Maria Falcone told the crowd: "They had told me Palermo  had gone to sleep. I see it is not true. We are here to launch a new Italy."
Meanwhile, Giuseppe Costanza, 38, Falcone's former chauffeur, chained  himself to the railings of a Palermo court Monday, saying the injuries he  suffered when the magistrate's car was blown up two years ago had been  forgotten.
Costanza was badly hurt when Falcone's armour-plated car was dynamited in  a Mafia attack on a motorway leading to Palermo airport.
Today, Costanza is disabled and can no longer drive. His protest outside  the court was designed to bring to public attention the fact that the state  had not found him another job or promoted him.
Costanza, who complained the authorities had "realised I was not a soldier  and concluded they owed me nothing," stood with a placard around his neck  bearing the words "victim of the Mafia and the state."
A total of 36 suspected Mafia members have been charged with the bombing.
