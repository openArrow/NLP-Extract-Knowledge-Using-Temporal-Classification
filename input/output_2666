Israeli commandos abducted a pro-Iranian Islamic  leader in Syrian-controlled eastern Lebanon in a spectacular pre-dawn  operation on Saturday, an army spokesman said.
Mustafa Dirani, whom Israel holds responsible for the capture of Israeli  airman Ron Arad in Lebanon in 1986, was seized from his home in the village of  Qsarnabaa in the eastern Bekaa Valley.
Lebanese military officials said two helicopters were used in the  operation at Qsarnabaa, 75 kilometres (45 miles) northeast of Beirut. There  were no casualties reported and the abduction took place without incident.
"This flawless, very bold and pinpoint operation allowed us to seize a man  who is very dangerous for Israel. It shows our army has a long reach and does  the impossible to retrieve our missing," said Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon  Peres.
"The No. 1 problem is to know what has happened to Ron Arad and to whom he  was handed over since his capture," he said.
It was the second time that Israel abducted a Moslem fundamentalist leader  to try and secure the release of Arad, the only missing Israeli servicemen in  Lebanon believed still alive.
In an almost identical operation in July 1989, Israeli commandos snatched  a religious figure of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid,  from his home in south Lebanon. Obeid is still being held.
The army spokesman said Dirani was the leader of a small group called the  "Resistance of the Faithful" which captured Arad in October 1986. Arad was  taken prisoner when his plane was shot down over the southern region of Sidon.
