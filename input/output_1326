Blue-chip stocks barely budged in a quiet market   early Tuesday as investors staked a Federal Reserve watch in anticipation of  another rise in short-term interest rates.
The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 0.92 point to 3,672.42 points  several minutes after the session opened on the New York Stock Exchange.
Monday the Dow gained 11.82 points to finish at 3,671.50.
An increase in short-term interest rates, widely expected by investors,  could encourage stock buying, said Larry Wachtel, an analyst at Prudential  Securities.
The bond market also was calm as interest rates on the the main 30-year  Treasury bond rose to 7.46 percent from 7.44 percent late Monday.
