"I was up and down in the first set but after that I played a lot better,"  admitted Graf, who has lost only two matches in ovber twelve months, after her  victory.
"Now I can think about Pierce."
Her 19-year-old Canadian-born rival, who has been transformed since coming  under the wing of new coach Nick Bolettieri, was again in remarkable form and   never seriously tested by a player ranked just outside the top-100.
"I was possibly a little more nervous today knowing it meant I would get  into the semi-final if I won," smiled Pierce after completing her win over  Ritter.
Pierce is the first French player since Francoise Durr in 1973 to reach  the last four of the event. Durr was the last home player to win the title --  in 1967.
"Now I am looking forward to playing Steffi," she said.
"I expect it to be a very hard and tough match and of course it would be  wonderful if I won. But I'm not expecting to win or to lose. I'm just going to  concentrate on every point."
