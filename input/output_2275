The Palestinian Fatah movement - the main component  of the PLO - has swapped its revolutionary rhetoric for words more suited to  climate of peace.
Two weeks after the Cairo accords on Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza  Strip and Jericho, the traditional references to "struggle in all its forms"  were replaced Thursday by an appeal for "effort and perseverence in the  building of the homeland".
A communique issued here by the Fatah revolutionary council also made  history by using the name "Israel" for the first time instead of its usual  "Zionist enemy".
The Fatah ruling body said that in future it would fight on a "cultural  and economic" level. "That will be the real test between us and Israel," it  said.
Fatah renewed its call for "unity" in Palestinian ranks and in support of  "Arab brethren" during the shift from armed warfare to "realisation on the  ground".
The estimated 100 members of the Fatah Revolutionary Council endorsed the  accords signed in Cairo on May 4 and set up some 15 ad-hoc committees to  assist the Palestinian authority in the autonomous territories, informed  sources said.
Fatah holds most of the seats in the 24-member autonomous "government", 18  of whose members are already known.
The Fatah committees will be responsible for transferring 350 Palestine  Liberation Organisation cadres starting next week.
Their other tasks will include assisting the Palestinian authority in its  future negotiations with Israel and preparing elections to the autonomous  council next autumn, the sources said.
