Japan's Kawasaki Steel Corp. announced Friday a  pre-tax loss of 32.3 billion yen (314 million dollars) for the year to March,  reversing a profit of 7.5 billion yen a year earlier.
The company also suffered a record net loss of 39.1 billion yen following  profit of 143 million yen the previous year, blaming valuation losses for  subsidiary company stocks and employment costs related to retirement benefits.
"Decreasing domestic sales volume and falling prices put extreme pressure  on earnings," Kawasaki said, adding that Japan's recession was further  exacerbated by a stronger yen, a cool summer and delays in public-works  projects.
The leading Japanese steelmaker, which like its rivals suspended its  year-end dividend payment, offered no forecasts for the current year but gave  a bleak assessment for its business outlook.
"Extremely difficult conditions are likely continue," a statement said.
"A complete recovery in consumer spending and private-sector capital  spending is not expected in the forseeable future. Market conditions are  expected to be stagnant and domestic demand for steel materials will remain  low. In addition, domestic and foreign competition is becoming increasingly  severe, and maturing steel demand is a possibility in the midterm," it warned.
In the latest year, overall sales declined 7.9 percent from a year earlier  to 1,005 billion yen, depressed by reduced revenue from steel and chemicals  which offset increased revenue from engineering and other activities.
Kawasaki said crude steel production fell 0.2 percent to 9.89 million  tonnes while product output dropped 1.9 percent to 9.60 million tonnes.
