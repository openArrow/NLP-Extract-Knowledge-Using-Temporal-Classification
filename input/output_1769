The US government denied Wednesday that it had  already basically decided to renew China's privileged trading status and was  now trying to prepare the public for the decision.
"It would be inaccurate to say that essentially the administration has  decided the question and now it's just a matter of ... rolling out that  decision," State Department spokesman Michael McCurry told reporters.
He said administration officials were discussing various options such as  partial sanctions as an alternative to outright withdrawal or renewal of  China's most favored nation trading status (MFN), but stressed that no  decisions had been taken.
"I think a candid assessment ..... would suggest there have been some  positive developments in certain parts of those elements of the executive  order and there have been, frankly, some setbacks or some negative  developments as well," McCurry said.
President Bill Clinton last year set significant improvement on human  rights as a condition for renewing China's MFN beyond June 3 this year.
Among recent progress was China's agreement to allow a US technical team  to visit Beijing to discuss US allegations that Voice of America radio  broadcasts are being jammed, a charge China has denied, McCurry said.
"My understanding is it's (the meeting) scheduled to occur two days from  now," McCurry said.
An end to the jamming was one of the conditions set by Clinton for MFN  renewal. Until now, China had refused to discuss the problem.
"We would welcome any progress that China would contribute, even at a late  date like this, to some of the things that we've already seen develop,"  McCurry said.
Asked what China needed to do in the next three weeks to meet the MFN  conditions, McCurry said there were a number of things, including the release  of more dissidents.
He also noted that the Chinese police interrupted an interview in Beijing  on Tuesday between a US television crew and leading dissident Wang Dan.
