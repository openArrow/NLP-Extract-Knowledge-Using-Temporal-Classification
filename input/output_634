Communist rebel leader Felimon Lagman said Sunday  he would force corrupt police and government officials to make televised  confessions, instead of killing them.
The head of the breakaway Manila-Rizal Regional Committee (MRRC) of the  underground Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) explained the change of  policy in an interview with the Manila Chronicle newspaper.
Lagman said that kidnapping officials to force public confessions would be  "more damaging" and would instill more fear than death.
He said kidnapped officials will be made to face television cameras,  newspaper and radio reporters and confess their wrongdoings.
Lagman said there would not be a "wave of violence" like that of the Alex  Boncayao Brigade (ABB) in the late 1980s. A policeman was gunned down almost  every week at that time by the hit squad under the MRRC.
"After you kill someone, the furor dies down in two or three days.  Exposing what actually happened will generate greater public awareness," the  rebel leader declared.
The shift in strategy came amid criticism of the ABB morals in handing  down the death sentence on suspected criminals.
Lagman's group claimed responsibility for last week's execution of Timoteo  Zarcal, a former police officer implicated in a kidnapping but acquitted in  court.
Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon has acknowledged that the justice system  -- which heavily favors the rich and takes years for a case to be resolved --  was not perfect. But he appealed to the ABB not to take the law in their hands.
Lagman gave as an example alleged government anomalies the sale of 40  percent of Petron, the country's largest oil refiner, to Saudi Aramco last  year for over 500 million dollars.
