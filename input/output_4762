Shares on the London Stock Exchange registered a  particularly somber week, with shares felling through the key, psychological  3,000 level on Friday as markets were nervous about possible rises in interest  rates.
The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares fell to its lowest level since  August, closing at 2,966.4 points on Friday -- a weekly drop of 160.9 points  or 5.1 percent.
On Wednesday, prices fell 2.2 percent, the sharpest daily fall in three  months with 11 million pounds lost during the day, while prices dropped 1.7  percent on Friday after a sharper-than-expected US first-quarter GDP figure  which rose three percent instead of 2.7 percent.
The Footsie has now dropped 16 percent since its highest-ever level at  3,539.2 points, reached on February 3.
Dealers were also worried by recent statements by Hans Tietmeyer, the  president of the Bundesbank, who indicated that the German central bank was  unlikely to cut interest rates for several months. They fear the US Federal  Reserve is still likely to raise US rates again to combat the decline in the  dollar.
The decline was accentuated by the weak trading volume, which saw less  than 700 million shares trading during the week.
Among those registering the most severe losses, Eurotunnel slumped 16  pence to 359 on Thursday, after announcing a rights issue worth 816 million  pounds, but shares picked up slightly on Friday as dealers said its financial  uncertainty was over.
Thorn EMI plummeted 89 pence to 1,025 despite a hike in profits to 326.5  million pounds, while Marks and Spencer declined 35 pence to 392.5 pence,  despite announcing a 16 percent rise in pre-tax profits to 851.5 million  pounds.
