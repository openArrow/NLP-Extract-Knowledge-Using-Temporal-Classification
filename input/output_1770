MAPUTO, May 18 (AFP) - Five months ahead of elections in Mozambique, the  former rebel RENAMO opposition still harbours hundreds of child soldiers in  tightly guarded military bases, according to a UNICEF report released  Wednesday.
According to the report, dated May 3, up to 2,300 children 'with war  experience' are "under military supervision, kept in tightly guarded bases  within RENAMO's strongest military zones."
These zones are spread throughout Mozambique, according to the report.
The report focusses on the situation of 'unaccompanied children' and  'youths with war experience' in RENAMO zones.
Reports that RENAMO used child soldiers have been frequent, although  RENAMO has publicly denied the practice since signing a peace accord with the  government to end civil war 18 months ago.
However, the report from the UN Children's Fund said: "Now with  approaching elections and the increasing pace of demobilisation, these  children are becoming increasingly problematic to RENAMO.'
For the first time, the report said, RENAMO central administrations are  showing serious concern about the problem and allowing UN agencies to  investigate.
One of the problems is that under international accords, the United  Nations does not recognise under-16 year-olds as soldiers, so children  captured by RENAMO who fought in the war are not eligible for demobilisation  pay or benefits.
The UNICEF report recommended promoting 're-integration' of these  children, preferably with foster parents, but admits that many of them are  highly disturbed.
