The International Atomic Energy Agency officially  confirmed Saturday that North Korea had refused to allow its inspectors to  check the refuelling of a nuclear reactor to make sure no fuel was being  diverted to make nuclear weapons.
The isolated communist state had said "it could not accept the  verification measures proposed," the agency said in a statement.
It said two senior agency members who had travelled to North Korea would  return Saturday, but that two IAEA inspectors there would remain to assess the  situation.
