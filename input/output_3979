The dollar fell in Europe on Wednesday in response  to disappointing figures on the US economy and despite a boost from news that  US-Japan trade talks will resume.
The dollar, which had risen early in the day to 1.6565 marks, fell later  on publication of figures showing that orders for durable goods in the United  States had risen by 0.1 percent in April instead of by one percent as had been  expected. It closed here at 1.6400 marks.
The dollar fell against the yen to 104.45 from 104.85 at the close on  Tuesday.
At the Union Bank of Switzerland analyst Paul Lambert said that the dollar  had also fallen because figures for sales of existing houses in the United  states had disappointed the market.
The mark was generally firm against European currencies, except against  the French franc after the Bundesbank had reduced its lowest repurchase rate  by three basis points to 5.20 percent. This was considered to be a small  reduction by the market.
Lambert said that this had confirmed market fears about the outlook for  interest rates in the light of remarks by Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer  on Monday implying that the bank would wait before reducing rates further.
The mark was firm against Scandinavian currencies which were under  pressure because Denmark had reported on Tuesday that inflation was 0.4  percent in April. The Swedish krone fell to 4.7225 to the mark from 4.6865 on  Tuesday.
Analysts fear that an increase in inflation in the region might prevent  central banks there from reducing rates.
The lira fell to 968 to the mark from 963.75 because the leader of the  Northern League Umberto Bossi is to appear in court in connection with the  Enimont scandal. Bossi's party is a member of the new coalition government.
The drachma was steady at 148.05 to the mark from 148.65.
The dollar was being quoted at 1.6400 marks against 1.6525 on Tuesday, at  104.45 yen against 104.85, at 1.4012 Swiss francs against 1.4125 and at 5.6238  French francs against 5.6438.
Sterling was at 1.5103 dollars against 1.5065, at 2.4829 marks against  2.4895, 157.75 yen against 15796, 2.1162 Swiss francs against 2.1279 and  8.4936 French francs against 8.5023.
The price of gold rose to 388.25 dollars an ounce from 387.50 dollars.
