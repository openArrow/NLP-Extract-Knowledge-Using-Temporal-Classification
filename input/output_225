Liberia's biggest armed faction, Charles Taylor's  NPFL, Friday ruled out peace talks with its Liberian Peace Council (LPC) foes,  contradicting an earlier LPC report that the two enemies planned negotiations.
"We are not aware of any meeting with the LPC," said NPFL spokesman John  Richardson.
The talks had been announced last week by the transition government's  information minister Joe Mulbah, a former NPFL spokesman.
But Richardson said that holding talks with the LPC, which the NPFL has  been fighting for supremacy along the Atlantic coast and the border with Ivory  Coast, "would be tantamount to recognizing it as a faction.
"That could encourage others to go into the bush and take up arms."
The LPC was set up in September 1993 but at the time did not sign on to a  peace accord reached two months earlier between the NPFL, the United  Liberation Movement for Liberation (ULIMO), and the former interim government.
The accord was aimed at ending a civil war that killed some 150,000 since  December 1989.
But disarming all the warring factions has proven difficult due to  continued clashes between the NPFL and the Peace Council as well as various  other ethnic clans.
Richardson said Friday that the NPFL had ceased to disarm its toops "due  to the inability of the the West African peacekeeping force, ECOMOG, to stop  the fighting between the NPFL and LPC, as well as the tribal fighting between  elements in ULIMO."
He added that the "NPFL is presently maintaining a defensive position to  stop all aggressions from those who want to hijack the peace process."
