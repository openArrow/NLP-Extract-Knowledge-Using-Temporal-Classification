Gold beach at Arromanches was the western-most  landing site assigned to British forces on D-Day and was where the mobile  Mulberry port was installed.
The 50th British division and the 8th armored brigade landed at 7:25 a.m.,  along with Royal Navy commandos. A total of 24,970 men reached this beach,  flanked to the west by high cliffs but open to the east.
The first tanks exploded on mines but the British had great success with  special vehicles that cut through tank traps. The defending Nazi Russian and  Georgian troops soon fled or surrendered.
German heavy guns remained, however. The allied warships Ajax, Arkansas,  Montcalms and Georges-Leygues battled the artillery, subduing it by evening.
Troops storming into Arromanches linked up with US troops who had secured  Omaha beach. On the morning of June 7, British soldiers from the 50th division  entered Bayeux, about 10 kilometres (six miles) southwest of Arromanches, the  first major town liberated in France.
An equally remarkable success for the British was a pre-fabricated port  established offshore at Arromanches. Sinking concrete jetties into the sea,  they created a harbor through which material and men poured, the  reinforcements needed to make the advances of D-Day a permanent success.
