North Korea said Saturday it had begun changing fuel  rods on a controversial nuclear reactor before the arrival of International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors.
"As is known, the replacement of fuel rods has begun at our five-megawatt  experimental nuclear power station according to its operation plan," a North  Korean foreign ministry spokesman said.
In an inteview with the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) monitored here,  the spokesman said the IAEA had baulked at sending inspectors to observe  refuelling operations at the plant while demanding samples from the fuel rods.
"Under such conditions, we had no choice but to remove seals and start  taking out fuel rods for safety reasons," the spokesman was quoted as saying  by the official news agency.
