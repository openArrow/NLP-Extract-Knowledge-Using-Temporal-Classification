Racers made final plans for the  Indianapolis 500 here Friday, knowing that passing will be difficult and  constant pressure on the favorites will be vital.
Pole-sitter Al Unser Jnr and reigning champion Emerson Fittipaldi are  favorites among Sunday's 33-car field. Their new Mercedes engines provide a  horsepower advantage, but their reliability is untested over 200 racing laps  around the 2.5-mile (4km) oval.
"I'm very anxious about how the engine will do in the race," said  Fittipaldi, who starts on the outside of row one. "But we have never tested  anything more than this engine."
Second-row starter Michael Andretti plans to give the Mercedes an  unprecedented endurance challenge, hoping to continue a 70-year streak of no  first-year engine winning here.
"More engine power means less fuel mileage, so it would help if they have  to make an extra stop," he said. "But the only way you can make them keep  drinking that fuel is to keep after them all day."
Reigning Indy series champion Nigel Mansell of England also expects  Mercedes durability to be the race's key.
"It's a good plan, but you've got to be competitive enough to push them.  If you're not, you're in for a long day," he said.
Front-row starter Raul Boesel of Brazil and Mario Andretti, making his  29th and fnal Indy start, are also expected to challenge. Canada's Paul Tracy,  another Mercedes driver, starts from the ninth row and could contend if he can  handle the tricky nature of passing on the super speedway.
"When you hit traffic, you will lose downforce," Fittipaldi said. "Trying  to stay close and set up the pass will be the toughest part for everyone. It's  my major concern for the race."
