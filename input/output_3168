The Swiss Sandoz group has made a  friendly takeover bid for the leading US baby-food group Gerber Products  valuing the company at 3.7 billion dollars, Sandoz said on Monday.
Sandoz had offered to acquire all of the shares in Gerber for 53 dollars  per share which was 53 percent more than the closing price on Wall Street on  Friday, Sandoz said.
The purchase would enable Sandoz to double the sales of its food division.  In the year to March Gerber achieved sales of 1.2 billion dollars and a net  profit of 127 million dollars before restructuring costs.
Gerber president Alfred Piergallini said in a joint statement that the  deal was in the best interests of Gerber shareholders, clients and employees.
He said that it was the fruit of several months of efforts to put Gerber  into a new situation. The future of Gerber rested entirely in the exploitation  of the company's strong points and competitive advantages in world terms.
The support of Sandoz opened new horizons of dynamic growth because it  gave access to the infrastructure operated by Sandoz in most of the big  markets.
The Gerber group holds 70 percent of the market for baby food in the  United States. It is also well represented in Mexico, Puerto Rico and in  Central America. It employs 12,000 people throughout the world.
