The Senate defied President Bill Clinton on  Thursday by approving a measure that would require the United States to lift  the arms embargo against Bosnia unilaterally.
Although the amendment, approved 50 to 49, has little chance of becoming  law, it undercut Clinton a day ahead of international talks in Geneva on  resolving the conflict.
The plan proposed by Senate Republican leader Bob Dole would force the US  administration to disregard the 1991 UN embargo and clear the way for US arms  shipments to help the Bosnian government defend itself in the two-year-old war.
Although Clinton has pressed for a multilateral lifting of the embargo, he  has maintained that a unilateral effort by Washington could undermine other UN  actions around the world.
The measure goes to the House of Representatives, where it was expected to  have little chance of passage. But even if it were approved, Clinton could  veto the measure, and a two-thirds majority of both houses would be needed to  override the veto.
Senate Democratic leader George Mitchell said the measure had no chance of  becoming law.
Earlier, senators passed by an identical 50-49 margin an amendment  sponsored by Mitchell calling on Clinton to seek a consensus among US allies  to lift the embargo. By placing the two amendments in the same bill, senators  appeared to give contradictory directives to the president.
