President Carlos Menem's plan to merge the  federal police, navy and army into a domestic security monolith with a 2.6  billion dollar annual budget came under fire from the opposition Monday.
Former president Raul Alfonsin, who leads the country's top opposition  force, the Radical party, said the concentration of security manpower and  funding under one roof was potentially a threat to the country's democracy.
"The idea of such a degree of concentration of state power is not  appropriate in a democratic era," said Alfonsin, Menem's predecessor in office.
Alfonsin urged the government to "reflect on the inappropriate nature of  moving the plan forward," which he said would require sweeping legal changes.
The opposition leader also said Menem was flouting the authority of the  constitutional convention due to start working on a constitutional reform  package next week in the city of Parana.
