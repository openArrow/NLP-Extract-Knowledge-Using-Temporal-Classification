Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin called  Friday for a boost to economic and trade cooperation between Russia and China,  saying he did not see Beijing as a threatening power.
He told a press conference relations which were satisfactory had "entered  a new era" with both sides moving towards developing their ties for the next  century.
"This economic and trade cooperation is vitally important not only for the  Asia-Pacific region but also for the whole world," he added.
While admitting there were still "some problems" in bilateral trade, which  fell in the first quarter of this year after a surge last year, none of the  problems were "insurmountable," Chernomyrdin said.
In particular cross-border trade needed to be developed, he said.
Questioned on the role China wants to play as a major power in the region,  he said "it is not a bad thing for China to develop."
"China has good relations with neighbouring countries, just as Russia  does," he said, referring in particular to Central Asian countries which  border both Russia and China.
"I do not think China is seeking to fill the void left by the Soviet  Union," he added.
Chernomyrdin, the first Russian prime minister to visit China since the  collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, held talks Friday with his Chinese  counterpart Li Peng and Chinese President Jiang Zemin, which he described as  "fruitful."
