At least four bombs exploded in trouble-torn  Karachi early Saturday, the official Associated Press of Pakistan said.
No casualties were immediately reported from the blasts which started when  unidentified attackers in a car hurled a bomb inside a mosque. People were  just gather for dawn prayers in the middle class Gulshan-i-Iqbal area of the  port city.
The bomb went off in the courtyard. An adjacent Islamic religious school  escaped without serious damage or injury, reports said.
Three more blasts were heard in Karachi's suburbs, police said without  giving details.
The early morning blasts followed a week of violent clashes between police  and the Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM) in which more than 30 people were killed.
The MQM represents Urdu speaking settlers from India after the 1947  partition of the subcontinent. It has accused the administration of the  southern Sindh province of persecuting its community.
The authorities accuse the MQM, the main opposition group in the Sindh  assembly, of involvement in alleged terrorism. MQM sources said more than  2,000 people had been arrested following clashes earlier this month. It said  "false" charges had been used.
