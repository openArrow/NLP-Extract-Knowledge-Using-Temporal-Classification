An 11-year-old boy dashed into a  blazing apartment and rescued a two-year-old boy who had been left  unsupervised, police said.
The boy hero said he simply ran in and grabbed the toddler, ignoring what  the Boy Scouts taught him -- to crawl under thick smoke.
"I thought it would take me too long if I had crawled," said Jason Dent,  who was alerted by screaming in the upstairs apartment of his building  Thursday night.
Six youngsters -- the oldest was six -- had been left alone in their  apartment when the two-year-old began playing with matches and set fire to a  book, police said.
Two mothers, one of whom was having a birthday, had each left their three  children in the apartment and gone out to celebrate, police said. Both women  were booked Friday and charged with child desertion.
