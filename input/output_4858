Tens of thousands of people turned out here Friday  for an anti-government demonstration led by the Union of Democratic Forces,  the day after Luben Berov's centrist government survived a no-confidence  motion.
Filip Dimitrov, chairman of the anti-communist UDF, called on UDF  supporters to demonstrate throughout the summer to provoke early elections and  said he was prepared to strike a reasonable bargain with other groups to  achieve that aim.
The government, made up of non-aligned experts, won the backing of  palriament on the basis of a programme leading up to early elections around  September.
All parliamentary parties, as well as President Zhelio Zhelev and  parliamentary speaker Alexander Yordanov, have critisied Berov's government  for inefficiency and have called for early elections.
