The government's approval of a genetically  engineered tomato Wednesday has spurred calls for biotech food regulations to  prevent of an invasion of altered products hitting unaware consumers.
Millions of Americans suffering food allegies could buy hundreds of  products that were once safe for them, but could become dangerous with mixed  genes, said environmental and consumer groups.
The Food and Drug Administration approved Flavr-Savr tomatoes, a strain  designed to ripen longer on the vine, yet remain fresh during shipping.
The Flavr-Savr is the first whole food product the FDA approved. The FDA  had previously approved genetically altered additives and hormones for dairy  products.
The FDA approval "gives the misleading impression that the agency is going  to oversee safety of all genetically engineered food," said Jane Rissler, a  plant pathologist at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
There is currently no federal policy requiring labels for genetically  altered goods.
The tomato is the first in a line of dozens of other crops that could be  altered. Researchers are experimenting with transplanting genes from one plant  into another to improve product quality.
The transfers however could carry the properties of the donor plants which  some people are allegic to over to the host plants.
"FDA's policy doesn't address serious food allergy concerns," said Douglas  Hopkins, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund.
FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler said "we remain committed to assuring  that foods produced by genetic engineering are as safe as food in our grocery  store today."
Flavr-Savr producers expect to have the tomato on the market in 10 days.
