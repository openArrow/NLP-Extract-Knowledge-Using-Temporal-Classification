French businessman Didier Pineau-Valencienne, who  was detained here Friday on charges of fraud, could be released on Wednesday  because of his good cooperation with investigators, police said here Tuesday.
Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of France's Schneider SA, an electrical  engineering group, has been charged with forgery, use of fraudulent documents,  embezzlement, falsifying of annual accounts and breach of accounting rules.
Also arrested on Friday on related charges was Italian banker Valentino  Foti. Belgian magistrates are due to decide early Wednesday on whether to  release the two men.
A Belgian financial investigator told AFP: "Mr. Pineau-Valencienne has  admitted many things."
The investigator added: "He is trying to minimise his role but he has the  final responsibility for the infractions he has been charged with. If he had  not played an active role in these affairs, he would not be in prison."
