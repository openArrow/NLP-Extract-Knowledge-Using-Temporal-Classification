At least four people were killed and 10 injured  when forces opposing Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani fired as many as 131  rockets on Kabul Monday, state-run Radio Kabul said.
The fierce rocketing by the forces of Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar  and Uzbek warlord general Abdul Rashid Dostam continued for four hours, said  the broadcast monitored here.
The last heavy rocket attack on Kabul was reported by the radio on Friday  when it said dozens of rockets landed in populated areas, killing four poeple.
The five-month old fighting between the forces of Rabbani and the  Hekmatyar-Dostam alliance has left more than 2,500 dead.
A Red Cross estimate last month said more than 17,000 people had been  injured in the war-torn capital.
