US food giant Heinz said Thursday  it has begun negotiations with Glaxo India to buy the Bombay-based company's  Family Products Division.
The transaction, in which a Heinz susidiary would buy the Indian food  company, has been approved by both companies' boards of directors. But the  deal is subject to further negotiations and must be authorized by the Indian  government and Glaxo shareholders.
Family Products Division produces Complan adult nutrition drinks, Glucon  drink mixes, Farex baby foods, Glacto infant formula, Minit Milk dairy  whiteners and Nycil talcum powder, generating about 50 million dollars in  annual sales.
The firm has about 950 employees.
"This acquisition will provide us with our first entry into India and its  vibrant market of over 900 million people," said Heinz Chairman and Chief  Executive Officer Tony O'Reilly.
In addition to its products, the buy will give Heinz an excellent   ready-made distribution system.
"This should provide a valuable platform for the launch of a wide range of  Heinz produced food products," said O'Reilly.
Heinz has more than seven billion dollars in sales in more than 200  countries and territories.
