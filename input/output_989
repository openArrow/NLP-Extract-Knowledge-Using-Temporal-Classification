A prosecutor at a district court in Surabaya, East  Java, on Monday sought 13-year jail terms for two security guards at a watch  plant for allegedly killing a labour activist whose death touched off a  political storm.
The news agency Antara quoted prosecutor Sirajuddin Ardan as saying that  the defendants, identified as Sup and Swn, had admitted to being involved in  the killing of Marsinah, a worker activist at the PT Catur Putra Surya (CPS)  watch plant.
They made the confession while standing as witnesses for the trial of CPS'  personnel manager, Mutiari, Antara quoted him as saying.
Mutiari, one of nine civilians allegedly involved in the murder, has been  sentenced to seven months' imprisonment for attending a meeting where the  murder was allegedly planned.
A military official, army captain Kusaeri, is also facing a military  tribunal for his alleged role in the murder.
The prosecutor said that, acting under the orders of the plant's director,  identified as JS, who is also on trial, the two defendants kidnapped and  tortured Marsinah and then dumped her body.
The presiding judge has authorised the two defendants, who want to appeal,  to read statement in their defence on May 23.
