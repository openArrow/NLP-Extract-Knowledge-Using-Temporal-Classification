Human rights and labor groups urged the US  administration Monday to deny extension of privileged trade status to China,  claiming Beijing's human rights record in the past year has not improved and  in some cases worsened.
"Just last week the Chinese government thumbed its nose at the  international community and said it would continue to crack down on dissidents  who commit the crime of exercising free speech," said Representative David  Bonior, who joined a news conference with 11 organizations.
Bonior and the organizations urged President Bill Clinton to end China's  most favored nation (MFN) status, claiming Beijing has done little to end  torture of prisoners, arrests of dissidents, forced labor and religious  persecution.
But some of the activists acknowledged that it would be politically  difficult to fully revoke MFN for China and suggested that targeted sanctions  could pressure the Chinese government to improve its human rights record.
Haiching Zhao, president of the dissident expatriate National Council on  Chinese Affairs, said that by targeting state- and army-run enterprises in  China would punish government and "provide a great opportunity for the  moderates to come out and challenge the hard-liners."
In contrast, he said extending MFN with no sanctions would "unleash a new  wave of repression and fear" in China.
He said that in contrast to some proposals to impose higher tariffs on  goods produced by the state sector, a simpler method would be imposing  sanctions on certain classes of goods that are largely produced by those  enterprises.
Several speakers said China had failed to live up to earlier pledges to  end prison labor, allow greeater freedom of expression and more information on  political prisoners.
"Not only in China, but also in Haiti, in Bosnia, in Rwanda and elsewhere,  tyrants are watching to see whether President Clinton upholds the most basic  principles of individual liberty and human dignity," said Kenneth Roth,  executive director of Human Rights Watch.
