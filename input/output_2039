New claims for US unemployment benefits fell by  14,000 to 367,000 in the week ending May 14, the Labor Department said  Thursday.
Wall Street analysts had forecast a much larger decline of 28,000.
Last week's decline was preceded by two weeks' of increases.
The department said its four-week moving average of initial claims,  considered a more accurate indicator of the US job market, rose 250 to 359,000.
