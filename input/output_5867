Claudio Caniggia scored his first  international goal since his cocaine ban ended as Argentina beat Israel 3-0 in  a World Cup warm-up here on Tuesday.
The forward, Argentina's outstanding player in the last World Cup finals,  struck in the 53rd minute after a double from Fiorentina striker Gabriel  Batistuta.
Diego Maradona prayers at the wailing wall earlier in the week failed to  pay off. The Argentinian captain had a quiet match before being substituted  ten minutes from the end.
Israel 0 Argentina 3 (Batistuta 27, 49, Caniggia 53)
