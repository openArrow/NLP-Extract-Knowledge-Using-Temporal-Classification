French Socialist leader Michel Rocard  late Thursday recommended lifting the ban on supplying arms to Bosnian Moslems  as the only way to bring the Bosnian Serbs to their senses.
Rocard told a campaign rally for next month's European parliamentary  elections that lifting the ban on weapons sales was "from now on, given the  attitude of the Serbs, the only way to attain a political settlement, which  will prove elusive for as long as the aggressors think they have more to gain  through force of arms."
"Lifting the embargo only as far as the Moslems, the victims of the  aggression, are concerned is a decision we no longer have the right to reject."
But he added it would be a "grave decision".
"We cannot on the one hand prove incapable of protecting the Bosnians and  on the other hand refuse them the means to defend themselves against the  aggression to which they are falling victim.
"We should use air strikes every time the (Serb) attacks start again. As  for the embargo, the US Senate itself has proposed lifting it. But in that  case we would have to be sure that NATO could provide all the necessary cover."
The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) is on standby to provide air  cover as and when requested by the United Nations to protect UN aid convoys  and UN peacekeepers, and to enforce a ban on Serb artillery on the hills  overlooking the Bosnian capital Sarajevo.
Rocard, a former prime minister, was responding to an initiative by French  intellectual Bernard-Henri Levy, who has entered a list of candidates for the  Euro-elections with a manifesto urging intervention in Bosnia, including the  lifting of the ban on arms sales to the Bosnian Moslems.
Meanwhile French premier Edouard Balladur, on a visit to France's  Caribbean departments, defended his government's policy in Bosnia, where  French soldiers have been the mainstay of the UN peacekeeping effort.
Speaking in Pointe-a-Pitre, capital of the French Caribbean island of  Guadeloupe, Balladur said that thanks to French involvement in the  peacekeeping mission, "the worst was avoided, humanitarian aid got through and  talks aimed at reaching a peaceful settlement began."
