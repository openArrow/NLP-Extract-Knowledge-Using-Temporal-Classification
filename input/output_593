The center-left Party of Brazilian Social  Democracy on Saturday named Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso its candidate  for the October presidential elections.
Cardoso, a former treasury secretary, is the closest rival to frontrunner  Luis Inacio "Lula" da Silva of the leftist Workers' Party, according to a  recent poll. Seventeen percent of those surveyed said they would vote for him,  compared with 41 percent for "Lula."
Senator Guilherme Palmeira, of the northeastern state of Alagoas, was  named his running mate for vice president.
Cardoso, in unveiling his party's government plan, said lowering Brazil's  chronic inflation inflation and stabilizing the economy would take between two  and three years.
The party narrowly voted to form an alliance with the rightwing Liberal  Front Party and the Brazilian Workers' Party.
The current president, Itamar Franco, is constitutionally barred from  seeking a consecutive term of office in the October 3 vote.
