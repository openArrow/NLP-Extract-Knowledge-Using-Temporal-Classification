The US embassy said Friday its consular  section that handles non-immigrant visas was closed until further notice.
Other consular sections of the embassy will remain open, an embassy source  said.
No reason was given for the action, which came two days after the  investiture of Emile Jonassaint as provisional president over protests by  Washington and the international community.
The United States has announced a ban on visas for military, members of  their families and all supporters of the regime.
A ban on non-commercial flights to the United States already is hitting  the country's mango exporters, who are in the midst of a harvest.
The US actions followed a UN Security Council resolution last Friday that  imposed an immediate ban on visas for the military, ordered their overseas  assets frozen and cut off non-commercial air links to Haiti.
