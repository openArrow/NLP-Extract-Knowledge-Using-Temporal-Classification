France's Orly airport is to open to flights from  London as of June 13, French Transport Minister Bernard Bosson said here  Monday.
He was speaking after meeting his British counterpart John MacGregor.  There are to be four flights a day by British Airways and its TAT subsidiary  from London's Heathrow airport, Bosson said.
The British company Air UK will also have four flights daily into Orly but  from the London's Stansted airport.
Air France is to make four flights daily between Orly and Heathrow.
French companies AOM and Air Liberte are seeking access to Heathrow and  "discussion are underway with London airport authorities," Bosson said.
As of the summer of 1995, planes with more than 200 seats will have to be  used during peak hours on the Paris-London route.
