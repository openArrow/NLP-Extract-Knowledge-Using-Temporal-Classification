The United States and Japan have agreed to  resume bilateral trade negotiations ending a three-month deadlock, US Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor announced Tuesday.
"I am pleased to announce a resumption of the framework negotiations  between the US and Japan," Kantor said.
Kantor said US president Bill Clinton had spoken with Japanese Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata for about 14 minutes immediately before the announcement.
Kantor said that working-level negotiations would resume as soon as  possible.
Kantor said that the Japanese side had reiterated its commitment under  last July's framework accord to continue to promote demand-led growth and  produce a highly significant decrease in its current account surplus.
He said that they had agreed "results-orientated goals" that would lead to  "increased access and sales" for US and other foreign products on the Japanese  market.
But he said that the US side "confirmed that we are not seeking numerical  targets."
He said the two sides had gone further than the framework agreement in one  area agreeing "to apply both qualitative and quantitative" measures of  progress whereas the framework had an either or approach.
