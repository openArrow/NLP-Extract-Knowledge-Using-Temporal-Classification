Blue-chip stocks continued to slide Friday after  bond interest rates jumped following an unexpected upward revision of US  economic growth in the first quarter.
The Dow Jones index of 30 leading industrials was down 9.83 points at  3,743.63 at 11:00 a.m. (1500 GMT).
The market was sluggish, with only some 69 million shares traded, as some  investors took the day off ahead of the Memorial Day holiday weekend.
"I don't think that today's going to tell us anything at all," said Edward  Collins, of Daiwa Securities America.
On the bond market, interest rates on the main 30-year Treasury bond stood  at 7.43 percent, up from 7.36 percent late Thursday.
The government reported gross domestic product grew three percent in the  first three months of the year, up from an initial estimate of 2.6 percent.  Most analysts had forecast a downward revision of 2.4 percent.
