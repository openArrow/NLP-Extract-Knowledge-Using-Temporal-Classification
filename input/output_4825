Bill Clinton's emphasis on liberalizing US  family and abortion policy at home and abroad has made for tense relations as  he prepares to meet the pope.
Clinton will meet Pope John Paul II June 2 when he arrives in Rome on his  way through Europe for D-Day commemorations.
Catholics at home and abroad have complained bitterly about Clinton's  stance on abortion and family values. The Clinton administration has supported  legislative actions paying for abortions in the United States.
Clinton has also sought more liberal abortion language in a UN plan for  slowing world population growth.
"It is increasingly clear that President Clinton is operating from a  totally different set of values than we who are Catholics," said Cardinal  Roger Mahony of the Los Angeles archdiocese in a letter to Raymond L. Flynn,  the US vatican envoy.
"I'm deeply concerned about keeping the relationship between the president  and the holy father, the pope, on a positive level," Flynn said.
Flynn said the Vatican told him "the pope has never expressed more anger  about a position and an issue than he has on this UN document." Flynn said the  pope plans to make it the number-one issue when he meets Clinton.
A White House official said the administration would agree to milder  language in the document and Clinton would stress that he does not favor  abortion as a means of birth control, but Clinton maintains it should be  available to women in developing nations.
Catholic Church officials are also upset with language defining a family  in the in a draft UN report.
"It would be a major step backward for our government to endorse novel  lifestyle patterns as a matter of international concern," wrote the Rev.  William H. Keeler, archbishop of Baltimore and president of the National  Conference on Catholic Bishops in a letter last month to Secretary of State  Warren Christopher.
