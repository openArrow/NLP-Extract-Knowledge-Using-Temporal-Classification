British and US officials will meet next week with  representatives of the Turks and Caicos Islands on a US request to use the  islands to process Haitian refugees, the Foreign Office said Wednesday.
A spokesman said US President Bill Clinton has asked British Prime  Minister John Major, in a telephone conversation Monday, for permission for  its Coast Guard to use the British islands in the Caribbean to screen Haitian  asylum- seekers.
A White House spokeswoman had said Tuesday the US was negotiating with "a  number of countries in the region about third-country processing and with some  countries not in the region about accepting additional refugees."
Major told Clinton the request "will be considered carefully, and it will  be, by British, American and TCI officials," said the British spokesman,  adding that no decision had been made.
He said it appeared that Washington simply wanted to consider the Haitian  asylum claims aboard ships anchored off the islands, not on the islands  themselves.
The Turks and Caicos are British dependencies. Only six islands in the  archipelago of about 30 islands southeast of the Bahamas are inhabited.
Clinton bowed to pressure from human rights groups May 8 and decided to  give fleeing Haitians immigration hearings before turning back those not  considered political refugees, reversing a two-year-old US policy of immediate  repatriation.
Tens of thousands of Haitians have risked sailing to US shores in rickety  boats since the 1991 ouster of president Jean-Bertrand Aristide in a military  coup.
