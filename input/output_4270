Barbra Streisand has canceled a show here  because of inflamed vocal chords, raising questions about the future of her  soldout US tour, her first in 27 years.
"She's under medication and she has been ordered to maintain strict voice  rest," said her spokesman, Ken Sunshine. "That means no talking at all, and  obviously, no signing."
Wednesday's show in Anaheim, her first on the West Coast, had been sold  out with some 13,000 people paying up to 350 dollars a ticket. Promoters said  it would be rescheduled, but there was still uncertainty over future concerts.
She was scheduled to perform again Friday in Anaheim before going on to  concerts in San Jose and New York.
"It all depends on how she feels," said Sunshine. "Ultimately Miss  Streisand makes the decision."
