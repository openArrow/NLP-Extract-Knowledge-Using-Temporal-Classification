The commander-in-chief of Russia's Pacific Fleet  was dismissed Tuesday for "serious deficiencies" in his management of the  fleet, following an explosion at a military depot in the far east, the Russian  Defense Ministry said.
Admiral Georgy Gurinov's removal followed an explosion Saturday of a bomb  depot in the region of the far eastern port of Vladivostok, which left no  casualties but caused considerable damage.
Gurinov was fired by presidential decree, which reproached him for not  personally taking part in operations that followed the explosion.
A total 1,600 tonnes of missiles, mines and shells were blown up in the  explosion, local administration chief Yevgeni Nazdratenko said in Vladivostok  on Monday.
The blast 100 kilometres (60 miles) from Vladivostok spread over a  10-kilometres (six miles) radius where villages had to be evacuated.
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev recently said the Pacific Fleet came "at  the bottom" of the different units of the Russian armed forces when judged on  efficiency and combat readiness.
The admiral was not present Tuesday to welcome a Chinese flotilla that  sailed into Vladivostok on a courtesy visit.
