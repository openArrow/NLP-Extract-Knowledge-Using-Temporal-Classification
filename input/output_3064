Cambodia's Khmer Rouge guerrillas Monday reported  attacks on government forces in widely-scattered areas from the extreme  northwest to the south.
In a broadcast monitored in Bangkok, Khmer Rouge radio said guerrillas had  "liberated Bavel for the third time" in a day-long battle on May 18, an  apparent reference to the rebels' hit-and-run combat tactics.
The radio also reported fighting in the extreme northwest of Cambodia,  between Ampil and Soeng and in in the northwest near Banteay Chhmar, in the  southwest around Kampot, southwest of Phnom Penh near Kompong Speu and in  east-central Cambodia in the area of Kompong Cham.
There have been no reports for some months of Khmer Rouge attacks in the  eastern area of Cambodia, where Vietnamese influence is seen as strong.
