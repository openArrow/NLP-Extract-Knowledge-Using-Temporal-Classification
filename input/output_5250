Argentina beat the United States  28-22 here this weekend in a 1995 Rugby World Cup qualifier.
The Pumas had tries from Martin Teran, Patricio Noriega and Jose  Santamarina.
The Eagles' total included tries fry Tomasi Takau and Andre Bachelet.
The United States travel to Buenos Aires for the return match on June 20.
If the two sides split the matches, the team with the most tries in both  matches will advance. If that decider still leaves them level, the team with  the most total points in the two matches will earn the World Cup berth.
