Japan Tobacco Co. Ltd., a government monopoly  targeted for a stock market listing in October, said Wednesday its pre-tax  earnings jumped 11 percent to 110 billion yen (1.07 billion dollars) in the  year to March.
The company said revenue was also buoyant, climbing almost two percent  from a year earlier to 3,460 billion yen, including sales of 273 billion  cigarettes in Japan and 16 billion cigarettes abroad. Comparisons were not  available.
Japan Tobacco said earnings were expected to remain flat at 110 billion  yen in the current year despite increased revenue of 3,500 billion yen.
Faced with continued competition from foreign tobacco manufacturers, the  company said it would focus on maintaining its current market share and  continue efforts to diversify into pharmaceuticals and agricultural businesses.
