Israel has corrected a "great error" by pulling  out of the Gaza Strip overnight, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Wednesday  as he left for Oslo.
"We have corrected a great error, which would have become even worse with  time," Peres told reporters at Ben Gurion airport.
Peres headed for an official ceremony in Norway to mark the Olso  government's role in brokering peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
"I wish the Palestinians every success so they can lead normal lives," he  said
But Peres added that he would raise with PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, who  is also due in Norway, his call for a "holy war" to liberate Jerusalem from  Israeli rule.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin warned Tuesday that the call would throw the  whole peace process in jeopardy if Arafat, who pledged an end to violence last  September, really intended it.
Peres was scheduled to meet French President Francois Mitterrand in Paris  before returning to Israel on Thursday, officials said.
