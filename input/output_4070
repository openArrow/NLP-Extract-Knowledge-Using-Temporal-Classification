Later a spokesman for the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front expressed concern  over French participation in any UN peacekeeping force.
"We have had a very stormy relationship with France during this conflict  and we feel the less we have to involve France in the resolution of this  conflict the better it is," said Patrick Mazimhaka, the first vice president  of the front at a news conference in New York.
In Geneva meanwhile, the UN Human Rights Commission named an Ivory Coast  lawyer to investigate the ethnic bloodletting in Rwanda.
But UN Human Rights Commissioner Jose Ayala Lasso later expressed concern  that the Rwandan government and rebels may not even let the envoy into the  country.
The special rapporteur is Rene Degni Segui, a 46-year-old law professor  and chairman of the Ivory Coast Human Rights League.
Under a resolution passed after a two-day emergency session on Rwanda, he  was assigned to travel to the tiny central African country and investigate the  "root causes and responsibilities" for the massacres there, which have left up  to 500,000 people dead by some estimates since April 6.
Degni Segui is to report back within a month with recommendations on how  to end the violence.
He was also asked to gather information on offenses that might be  considered crimes against humanity.
Ayala Lasso, who recently visited Rwanda, told a press conference that  both the government and rebels had requested "the presence of the UN to  investigate, establish responsibilities and to punish, and both sides pledged  cooperation."
Rwanda has a long blood-steeped history of violence between the Hutus and  Tutsis. A peace accord between the Hutu-dominated government and rebels of the  mainly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front was signed last August.
But the war broke out again after the April 6 death of president Juvenal  Habyarimana in a suspected rocket attack on his plane.
