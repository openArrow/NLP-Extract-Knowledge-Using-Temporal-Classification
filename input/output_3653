A federal judge sentenced two of four Moslem  fundamentalists to 240 years in prison Tuesday for the bombing of the World  Trade Center last year, saying he expected them to die behind bars.
Mohammed Salameh, 26, Mahmud Abouhalima, 34, and Niddal Ayyad, 26, and  Ahmad Ajaj, 28, were convicted March 4 of all counts in the February 26, 1993  attack, which killed six people and injured more than 1,000.
Salameh, who drove the van that carried the bomb, and Ayyad, who ordered  chemicals used in making the bomb, were each sentenced to 240 years in prison.  Sentencing of the two others were still pending.
US Distric Judge Kevin Duffy earlier said he arrived at the sentence by  calculating the number of years of life the victims were deprived of -- 180 by  his estimate -- and then added 30 years for each of the other two counts  against him.
Before handing down the sentence, Duffy let the defendants speak and also  allowed the husband of a pregnant clerical worker killed in the blast address  the court.
"I'll never get a chance to see him grow up," said Ed Smith of the boy his  wife was carrying. "We all lost this because of four men who wanted to blow up  landmarks in New York."
The explosion in the heart of New York City's financial center was the  first of its kind here and raised fears that the scourge of Middle East  terrorism had spread to the United States.
The four were accused of making a huge but unsophisticated bomb and  parking it under the 110-story twin towers of the World Trade Center in a  rented van.
When the bomb detonated just after noon, the explosion ripped open a 200  foot-crater, destroyed parked cars, and caused the roof of the mezzanine of an  adjacent train station to collapse, trapping dozens of people.
The four were quickly arrested -- easily traced by the FBI because Salameh  had used his own name in renting the van and a storage locker where the  materials used in building the bombs were made.
