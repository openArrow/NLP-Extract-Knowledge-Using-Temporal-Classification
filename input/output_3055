Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic vowed Sunday to  negotiate and, if necessary, fight to preserve the territorial integrity of  Bosnia.
Izetbegovic arrived here on Sunday night from Saudi Arabia as guest of  French intellectual Bernard-Henri Levy, who is campaigning for a lifting of  the arms embargo against the mainly-Moslem government forces and recently  released "Bosna," a film about the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Izetbegovic complained that the intervention of the international  community in his country had been "negative" and had left the Moslems with  their "hands tied." He said he would continue to strive to have the arms  embargo lifted.
"If our conditions are not met and if the arms embargo is not lifted, we  will go on fighting," he told journalists.
The French government has opposed lifting the embargo, saying it could  precipitate the "crushing" of the Moslem forces or lead to a long-drawn out  war.
Izetbegovic, who returns home Monday, told compatriots who came to applaud  him on his arrival that the Serbs "will never kill as many Bosnians as we will  have children."
Referring to a tour he made of territory under Bosnian army control,  Izetbegovic said government forces were making progress. "We will fight or  die," he said.
Levy, who has denounced Europe's failure to counter militant "Serb  nationalism," is considering launching a "Sarajevo" list of candidates in the  European elections next month.
The list, called "Europe begins in Sarajevo," would be headed by cancer  specialist Leon Schwartzenberg.
