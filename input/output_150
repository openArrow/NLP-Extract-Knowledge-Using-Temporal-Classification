The dollar closed higher at 104.58 yen on the Tokyo  foreign exchange market Friday, up 0.48 yen from the previous day's finish of  104.10 yen.
Dealers attributed the dollar's advance chiefly to dollar buying by the  Bank of Japan, the central bank, on the foreign exchange market. The size of  the market intervention was not immediately clear.
Investors bought dollars on press reports that Japanese officials were to  visit Washington to pave the way for resuming framework trade talks with the  United States, dealers said.
The closing rate here Friday was higher than 104.22 yen quoted in New York  in late trading overnight.
After opening at 104.15 yen, the greenback moved between 104.07 yen and  104.73 yen in Tokyo Friday.
Spot turnover increased from the previous day's 5.057 billion dollars to  7.248 billion dollars.
The mark closed at 1.6705 to the dollar here Friday, against 1.6667 the  previous day.
