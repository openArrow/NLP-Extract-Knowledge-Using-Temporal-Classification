Fears that unusually low interest rates would  soon be on the upswing pushed up sales of existing homes 1.2 percent in April,  a real estate industry group said Wednesday.
"Affordability conditions have been so good over the last year that  first-time and trade-up buyers became concerned when mortgage rates started  their upward crawl," said Robert Elrod, president of the National Association  of Realtors.
"With the start of the spring home-buying season, many consumers decided  to lock in before the volatile investment markets pushed the possibility of  buying a home out of their financial reach," added Elrod.
A fixed-rate, 30-year mortgage averaged 8.32 percent last month, up from  7.68 percent in March, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  April's rate was the highest since June 1992.
Since then, rates have continued to go up, peaking at 8.77 percent in  mid-May.
Sales of used homes totalled 4.12 million for April, up from 4.07 million  the previous month, with sales up in the midwest and west and slipping in the  northeast and south.
A total of 3.8 million existing homes were sold in 1993.
The value of the homes also rose slightly in April, with the median price  at 108,900 dollars in April, 3.2 percent higher than the 105,000 dollar median  price one year ago.
