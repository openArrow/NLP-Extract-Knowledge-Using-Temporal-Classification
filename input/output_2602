Some 4,700 people held in Peruvian prisons are  charged with terrorism, state prosecutor Daniel Espichan said Friday.
An estimated 4,350 of the prisoners took advantage of a law providing  leniency to guerrillas who turn themselves in and renounce their links to  rebel movements, Espichan said.
About 3,100 of the prisoners were affiliated with the Shining Path  guerrilla movement, the others with the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, he  added.
Some 260 leaders of the two organizations have been convicted by special  military tribunals and sentenced to life imprisonment.
