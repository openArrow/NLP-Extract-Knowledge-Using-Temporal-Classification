Richard Gephardt, the Democratic majority  leader in the House of Representatives, gave the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade (GATT) a boost Wednesday by announcing he would back it.
"We're here today to show our support for GATT," he told a press  conference.
GATT, signed in Marrakesh, Morocco last month after seven years of  negotiations, is expected to lead to an increase of 750 billion dollars in  trade over the next 10 years.
"The bottom line is that we believe GATT will help the economy to grow. It  will create jobs. It will raise America's standard of living," said Gephardt.
The powerful lawmaker had been reluctant to back the accord, but his  support improves the chances that it will be ratified by the end of the year,  as President Bill Clinton's administration has requested.
