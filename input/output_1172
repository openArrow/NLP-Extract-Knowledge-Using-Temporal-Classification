Palestinian gunmen shot dead an Israel woman and  seriously wounded two other Israelis in an ambush south of the West Bank town  of Hebron on Tuesday, military officials said.
The killers lay in wait by the roadside near the Jewish settlement of  Haggai, south of Hebron, and opened fire on a passing car.
It was the first killing of an Israeli since Israel and the PLO signed an  agreeement on May 4 to implement autonomy in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank  town of Jericho.
However there have been several attacks on Israelis on the Gaza Strip in  recent days and a Jewish lorry driver was seriously wounded near the  settlement of Morag on Thursday.
