English Premiership club West Ham United have  transfer-listed midfielder Mike Marsh for 1.5 million pounds.
Marsh is desperate to move back north, less than a season after arriving  from Liverpool, because his wife has been unable to settle in the London area.
West Ham chief executive Peter Storrie said: "It is a nightmare situation  for the club. You want to keep a talented player but you realise he has to  think about his young family.
"It has got nothing to do with football. The remarkable thing is that he  has continued to play so well with this on his mind."
Marsh has played 42 games for West Ham, scoring three goals, since  arriving at the club with Anfield team-mate David Burrows in a deal that saw  Julian Dicks go in the opposite direction.
Republic of Ireland striker Tony Cascarino and Northern Ireland defender  Mal Donaghy have been given free transfers by another London club, Chelsea.
Cascarino, 31, who hopes to play in this summer's World Cup finals in the  USA, joined the Stamford Bridge outfit two seasons ago and came on as a  substitute in Saturday's FA Cup final defeat by Manchester United.
Donaghy, 36, moved to Chelsea from United at the start of the 1992-93  season.
Aston Villa and England winger Tony Daley, 26, has agreed a 1.3 million  pound move to First Division Wolverhampton Wanderers, managed by former  England boss Graham Taylor.
Four of Manchester United's League and Cup double heroes will be  undergoing surgery in the next seven days.
Captain Steve Bruce will have an operation to remove a "foreign body" from  his knee while winger Ryan Giggs is booked to have his tonsils out.
Bruce's central defensive partner Gary Pallister is to have a painful  growth removed from his foot while midfielder Paul Ince faces a hernia  operation.
