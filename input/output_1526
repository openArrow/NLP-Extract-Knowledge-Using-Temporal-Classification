Early unofficial results from Malawi's landmark  elections showed the three main presidential candidates leading in their  regional powerbases Wednesday, state-controlled radio said.
Bakili Muluzi of the United Democratic Front -- who has been tipped to win  the presidency -- was leading in the south, President Hastings Kamuzu Banda  was ahead in the central region and Chakufwa Chihana of the alliance for  Democracy was on top in the north, the radio said.
Fourth presidential contender, Kamlepo Kalua of the Malawi Democratic  Party, was reported to be performing poorly throughout the country.
Counting of votes was continuing Wednesday after delays caused by  transport problems.
Official results of Tuesday's poll, which ended three decades of one-party  rule, are expected Thursday.
