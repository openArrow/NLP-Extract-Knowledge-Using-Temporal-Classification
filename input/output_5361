More than 350 well-dressed but grim Afghan  intellectuals attended a seminar here Monday and called for the protection of  human rights as rival factions traded gunfire in west Kabul.
"The Afghan people have suffered so much for so long, they need peace and  security," said Mohammad Yamin, chairman of a citizen's forum which called the  Servants of Peace and Reconciliation.
The two-day seminar began at the Intercontinental Hotel under the auspices  of the forum, reflecting the agony and desperation of the war-weary residents  of Kabul.
"It may look no more than a cry in the wilderness, but what else can we do  in a city battered by anarchy and bloody power struggle," said a participant.
The fighting between forces loyal to President Burhanuddin Rabbani and  those opposing him has claimed more than 2,500 lives and left more than 17,000  wounded in Kabul since January.
The anti-Rabbani alliance mainly includes the Hezb-i-Islami faction of  Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and the Uzbek warriors of former communist  general Abdul Rashid Dostam.
Several peace initiatives by Afghan mediators and outsiders have failed to  halt the internecine bloodshed.
The Intercontinenal gathering attracted many beggars who waited nearby in  the hope of getting more alms.
An old man among them said "my real concern is to collect enough money to  buy a coffin, as the government hospitals offer free coffins for fighters  only."
