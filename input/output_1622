Half a million people have died in Rwanda's ethnic  slaughter, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said Wednesday.
"It may not be known, but you can write this down, that according to  information we Europeans have 500,000 people have been slain, 500,000 people,"  he told a press conference.
Aid organisations previously put the figure at around 200,000.
Before the war broke out on April 7, Rwanda's population was estimated at  7.5 million. Half a million dead would mean that one out of every 15 Rwandans  or seven percent of the population has been killed in the last five weeks in  the small central African nation.
The UN Security Council has decided to deploy 5,000 troops in the nation  to stop ethnic butchery between majority Hutus and minority Tutis.
But UN officials have warned the peacekeepers will be powerless to staunch  the bloodletting unless they deploy speedily with armoured vehicles and  helicopters.
The UN this week decided to send peacekeepers back to Rwanda after coming  under heavy criticism for withdrawing all but 400 of its 2,500 ceasefire  monitors when an ethnic bloodbath engulfed the country after the April 6 death  of president Juvenal Habyarimana in a mysterious plane crash.
Extremist militias from the majority Hutu tribe which dominates the  government have been blamed for much of the killing.
