The Khmer Rouge Sunday accused the United States  of waging undeclared war on Cambodia for the second time in 25 years, and  alleged that Vietnam, France and Australia were backing Washington.
In a broadcast monitored in Bangkok, Khmer Rouge radio said the United  States, working in close cooperation with Vietnam, was funding Phnom Pemh's  attacks on guerrilla positions.
France was providing transport and munitions support and helping evacuate  government wounded by helicopter, while Australia and other Western countries  ensured telecommunications operations, the radio said.
"In the past few months, the Americans have been waging a covert or  undeclared war," the Marxist faction's radio said.
Recent events recalled the first US war against Cambodia in 1970-1975, and  would "meet the same fate," it said, referring to the Khmer Rouge victory in  April 1975 over the US-backed Lon Nol government in Phnom Penh.
It said recent visits to Phnom Penh by US State Department and Defense  Department officials were intended to "prepare for the transport of arms and  ammunition, in collaboration with the Vietnamese communists, to continue the  war in Cambodia."
