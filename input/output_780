A further 100 shells rained down Saturday on the "Sapna finger" east of  Tuzla, and a UN armoured patrol of Nordic troops came under automatic arms  fire on both Saturday and Sunday, Kirk said.
Bosnian government forces managed over the weekend to take control of Serb  positions at Vijenac hill, near Lukavac, southwest of Tuzla, "from where some  of the shells hitting our villages and Tuzla had been fired," Bosnian Colonel  Ekrem Advic, head of the press servic of the Bosnian army's Second Corps told  AFP.
The capture by the Bosnian army of "some 10 square kilometres" (four  square miles) of land in the sector was confirmed by sources close to the UN  Protection Force, who linked the Bosnian offensive and the shelling of Tuzla  Wednesday.
