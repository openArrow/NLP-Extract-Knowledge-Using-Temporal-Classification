The Europe Union should mark time to bed down  the application of the Maastricht treaty and must not rush into monetary  union, Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer said Monday.
There should be a pause after the Maastricht treaty had taken effect and  after new members had joined the union he said in a reference to the planned  adhesion of Finland, Norway, Sweden and Austria.
Tietmeyer told the German-Finnish chamber of commerce in Helsinki in a  speech made available here he thought that Europe would be well advised to  mark a pause during which everything which had been decided so far could be  carried out and consolidated.
The integration which was under way by members of the union should be  achieved through a process of variable speeds. He said that Europe should be  composed of concentric circles and that each circle would in itself represent  a degree of integration.
The establishment of a such a process depended on the political will of  member states.
An undue rush towards monetary union might wreck the whole process of  European integration.
There is a great danger of seeing monetary union, set in place despite  economic realities, resulting in inflation or failure, he warned.
The only way in which to avoid such an outcome was to give absolute  priority to the criteria of convergence of national economies which were more  important than the timetable laid down for the establishment of monetary union.
Under the timetable the third and final stage of monetary union must begin  in 1977 at the earliest and in 1999 at the latest. The plan requires member  countries to achieve targets for the performance of their economies to ensure  that they are converging.
Tietmeyer said that at the moment there was not much chance that most of  the member states would be ready for the third stage at the end of 1996.
Even for the beginning of 1999, without doubt nearly all of the member  states will have to make a big effort, he added.
