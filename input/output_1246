Ten children and a Rwandan woman working for the  UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) were found hacked to death in the woman's central  Kigali home, a UN spokesman said Tuesday.
"Civilians armed with guns, grenades and machetes entered the house and  hacked the victims to death," spokesman Abdul Kabia said by telephone from  Kigali.
The massacre, which occurred Sunday, was reported to the UN Assistance  Mission in Rwanda on Monday, and UN officials went to the scene Tuesday, Kabia  said.
Kabia said it was unclear whether the victims were from the minority Tutsi  tribe that has borne the brunt of six weeks of bloodletting in which relief  officials estimate between 200,000 and 500,000 people have been butchered.
Five of the victims were the UNICEF employee's children, and the others  were children who had sought refuge in her home near the Belgian school from  death squads roaming Kigali's streets, Kabia said.
Extremist militias from the majority Hutu tribe only loosely controlled by  the government have been blamed for much of the killing in Rwanda.
