Fifteen Touareg rebels were killed and five  government troops wounded when an army patrol clashed with rebels trying to  steal an official vehicle, Interior Minister Ousmane Oumarou told AFP Thursday.
Five rebels were detained after the incident, which happened Monday  between Assode and Timia, in the Iferouane region.
Troops seized a four-wheel drive vehicle, weapons, ammunition and various  documents of the Front for the Liberation of the Air and Azawagh (FLAA), one  of four Tourag rebel movements in Niger.
The clash came after the government and the rebels last week said they  would seek a negotiated end to the three-year conflict which has claimed more  than 100 lives.
Officials from mediating countries -- Algeria, Burkina Faso and France --  met with delegates from the two sides last week and said the government and  the rebels agreed in principle to a meeting soon.
Both sides last met in Ouagadougou in February.
