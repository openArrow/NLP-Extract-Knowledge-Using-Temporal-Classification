The US economy shows few signs of inflationary  pressure, the White House said Tuesday as the Federal Reserve's policy-setting  committee held a meeting expected to raise short-term interest rates.
In a statement indicating the administration's position that another rise  in short-term interest rates would not be justified, White House spokeswoman  Dee Dee Myers said that "growth is proceeding at a steady pace. There are few  signs of inflationary pressures within the economy.
The government's latest Consumer Price Index, published Friday, rose 0.1  percent in April, she said, pointing out that the inflation barometer "showed  continued growth with very modest inflationary pressures."
Myers did not say that the Fed should not raise rates, emphasizing that  the central bank "obviously is independent."
The Fed's Open-Market Committee began its meeting at 9:00 a.m. (1300 GMT).  Markets were widely anticipating a hike in the federal funds rate -- the rate  of overnight interbank loans -- between a quarter to a half percentage point.
The federal funds rate stands at 3.75 percent after three Fed moves  bumping it up a quarter percentage point since February 4.
