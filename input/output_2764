Further US-Japan talks aimed at breaking a  three-month deadlock in trade negotiations have been delayed until Monday,  said a US official here Saturday.
The talks had been expected to continue Saturday but late Saturday morning  the official said no meetings were planned for Saturday or Sunday and that  they would now resume most likely on Monday.
This should not be interpreted that the talks had run into problems, added  the official.
Late Friday President Bill Clinton's deputy economic advisor Bowman Cutter  said: "The conversations are going well."
The talks had originally been scheduled to last only one day, and the few  comments made by officials since Thursday morning have generally been hopeful.
Both sides have kept comments to a minimum, but US Trade Representative  Mickey Kantor said that the talks had started well, and the extension into a  second and then a third day suggested that the two sides were involved in  serious detailed discussion.
The two sides are trying to reach agreement on the ground rules for  resuming negotiations on ways to open Japan's markets and reduce its 60  billion dollar trade surplus with the United States under a July accord.
Talks broke down in February in disagreement on how to measure progress,  with Japan rejecting a US demand for numerical targets as leading to managed  trade and quotas.
Washington has consistently said it would not return to the negotiating  table unless Japan came up with new proposals that would give the talks a good  chance of success.
This week's talks were at Japan's request, and reports out Tokyo before  they began suggested the Japanese side might be bringing proposals for a  limited acceptance of such targets in the area of government procurement.
