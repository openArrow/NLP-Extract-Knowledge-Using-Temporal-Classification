diplomat
BANGKOK, May 25 (AFP) - Nearly 20 countries of the Asia-Pacific indicated  support for US efforts to "encourage" North Korea's compliance with the IAEA  nuclear watchdog at an international security conference, a US diplomat said  Wednesday.
"Almost everyone ... voiced support for what we have been trying to do,"  Thomas Hubbard, a deputy assistant secretary at the US State Department, told  reporters at a press conference Wednesday, following the ASEAN Regional Forum  (ARF).
Hubbard, who headed a US delegation to the largest ever security  conference for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, said  representatives from 18 countries had discussed a wide range of concerns,  including Cambodia, Burma and the nuclear standoff in North Korea.
With the notable exception of China and "some other countries," Hubbard  said, participants indicated "it is important to pursue a dialogue ... to  encourage (Pyongyang) to comply with its obligations under the (nuclear)  non-proliferation treaty."
There had been no specific discussions on what form the encouragement  might take, he said.
The ARF meeting is considered an agenda-setter for the ASEAN  ministerial-level security gathering July 25 in Bangkok.
Indonesia, an ASEAN member, has been active as the Non-Aligned Movement  (NAM) chairman to pressure North Korea to submit to inspections, Hubbard said.
The NAM is to hold its annual meeting in Cairo from May 31 to June 3.
ASEAN, chaired this year by Thailand, had not indicated whether it would  directly address the North Korea issue in July, Hubbard said.
The ARF conference has had an unprecedented attendance this year, with  observers from Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia. ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia,  Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
