Three men were charged Wednesday in separate  attacks on tourists in Florida and California, the latest incidents in a  growing trend of violence against visitors to the United States.
Two 19-year-olds, You Yang and Kham Ktsouvannasane, were booked for  investigation in the shooting of a German couple who were strolling in the  California mountains on May 16.
Gisela Pfleger, 64, was killed and her husband wounded in the attack which  authorities said was apparently motivated by robbery.
Meanwhile in Miami, Cedric Thompson, 33, was charged with armed kidnapping  and robbery for hijacking a bus carrying a group of Norwegian tourists on May  13 from the Miami International Airport.
Thompson was arrested on an unrelated carjacking incident Sunday and was  then charged Wednesday with the hijacking, in which two men held a gun to the  drivers head and stole an estimated 9,000 dollars worth of goods and cash from  the passengers.
A recent wave of attacks on foriegners around the Miami airport have  prompted warnings abroad about the safety of US travel.
Ten foreigners have been murdered in Florida since the end of 1992 and in  March this year two Japanese students were killed in a carjacking near Los  Angeles.
