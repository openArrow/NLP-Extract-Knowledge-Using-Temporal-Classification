Presidents Richard von Weizsaecker of Germany and  Francois Mitterrand of France met for a farewell lunch here Thursday six weeks  before the end of Weizsaecker's second and last term in office.
Weizsaecker, who made his first official visit to France 10 years ago,  will also make farewell visits to London and Warsaw before his term ends on  June 30.
The German Federal Assembly will elect his successor in Berlin on Monday.
Weizsaecker called on leaders in Germany and France to agree on a "truly  common foreign and security policy."
He said initial disagreements between Bonn and Paris over the conflicts in  the former Yugoslavia had "fortunately" been overcome.
Germany was quick in recognizing the former Yugoslav republics of Slovenia  and Croatia while France, in the early stages of the Yugoslav conflict, sided  with the Serb-controlled federal authorities.
