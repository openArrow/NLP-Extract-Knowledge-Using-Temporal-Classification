Meanwhile in Geneva, 500 Rwandans -- Hutus and Tutsis -- gathered at a  religious service to mourn the dead in their stricken homeland, organizers  said.
Demonstrators rejected official claims that the fighting in the African  country was an ethnic conflict.
"The president's private radio called for the execution of the Tutsis,"  said one of those attending the ceremony, "that's why they talk about an  ethnic conflict.
"But in fact all government opponents are being attacked, including Hutus."
