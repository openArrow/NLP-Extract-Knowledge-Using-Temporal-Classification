Seven-Eleven Japan Co. Ltd. has agreed with Philip  Morris Inc. of the United States to jointly develop food products for  convenience stores across Japan and the United States, a spokesman said Monday.
Seven-Eleven Japan, the largest convenience store operator here, will  start selling a low-priced canned beer made by Miller Brewering Co. Ltd., a  subsidiary of Philip Morris, late next month, the spokesman for Seven-Eleven  Japan said.
The spokesman said the two firms had been discussing a tie-up for the past  two years.
Seven-Eleven Japan, whose parent company is Ito-Yokado CO. Ltd., also  plans to develop and sell cheese and other products with Kraft General Foods  Inc., also affiliated with New York-based Philip Morris, he said.
Ito-Yokado holds a 50.75 percent stake in Seven-Eleven Japan and owns a  majority stake in Southland Corp. which operates Seven-Eleven stores in the  United States.
The tie-up between Seven-Eleven Japan and Philip Morris is the first such  alliance involving a major Japanese retailer and a major foreign food  supplier, major business daily Nihon Keizai newspaper said.
