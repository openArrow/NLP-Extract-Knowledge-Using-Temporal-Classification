The Philippine Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered the  government to allow a private human rights conference on human rights abuses  in East Timor to go ahead, overturning a lower court ban, officials said.
A Supreme Court resolution ordered the lower court to "cease and desist  from enforcing or implementing" its order to ban the conference, which has  sparked threats of retaliation from Indonesia.
Indonesia annexed the former Portuguese territory in 1976.
But the high court upheld Philippine President Fidel Ramos' authority to  expel foreigners attending the meeting.
"Nothing in this resolution should be interpreted as impairing the  constitutional and statutory authority of the president of the Philippines to  exclude aliens from entering the Philippines when demanded by national  interest and national security," the resolution said.
Manila has expelled 10 foreign participants in the May 31-June 3 meeting,  citing Ramos' opinion that their presence here would be "inimical to the  national interest."
