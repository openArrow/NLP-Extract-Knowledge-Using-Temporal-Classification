Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Monday demanded  a written commitment to the Palestinian self-rule deal from PLO leader Yasser  Arafat after his claim that the accord could be broken.
Rabin's spokeswoman Lynda Shimon said the prime minister was seeking  Arafat's written pledge "that the PLO will adhere to the (autonomy) agreement  signed in Cairo" along with the Declaration of Principles signed at the White  House last September and the mutual recognition accord.
Israel radio on Sunday broadcast extracts from a speech made by Arafat in  South Africa in which he said the autonomy agreement was purely a tactical  move and could be broken.
Environment Minister Yossi Sarid warned that Israel "will not continue the  autonomy negotiations unless Arafat retracts his comments."
Sarid said the remarks had created a "serious crisis of confidence"  between Israel and the PLO, which signed the Palestinian self-rule deal in  Cairo on May 4.
Israel was demanding that Arafat "totally denies these statements," Sarid  said.
The two sides are set to hold talks on the transfer of more powers to  Palestinians in the rest of the West Bank.
Arafat spoke in English, but used the Arabic name for the pact, "solh  al-hodaibiya", which has entered Islamic history as a tactical ceasefire.
"It's an Islamic legal precedent regarding any agreement between the  Islamic world and infidels. An agreement can be made with the enemy and then  broken as soon as possible," he said.
The radio triggered a furore last week when it broadcast another extract  of the May 10 speech in which Arafat called for a "jihad" to recapture  Jerusalem.
Arafat had to hastily explain that despite the connotations of "jihad," he  had not meant a holy war by jihad.
An unconvinced Rabin described the explanation as "evasive," and warned  after gunmen Gaza killed two soliders on Friday that any further attacks would  stall the autonomy process.
