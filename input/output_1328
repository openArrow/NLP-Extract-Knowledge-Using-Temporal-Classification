Welsh football's controversial chief  executive Alun Evans was at the centre of a resignation mystery on Tuesday.
Football Association of Wales committee member Tommy Forse was reported as  saying: "I am not surprised that Mr Evans has resigned.
"He has been under tremendous pressure over the last few weeks. I think he  has done the right thing."
However, it later emerged that Forse had returned from holiday only hours  earlier, and may not have been in full possession of the facts.
There have been growing demands for Evans' resignation following a loan  made to another sporting body without the authorisation of the FaW finance  committee.
Evans, who has been on sick leave at the weekend, was also the prime mover  in the sacking of national team manager Terry Yorath, and the subsequent  appointment of John Toshack, who then resigned after one game.
Evans had made a verbal offer to quit last week but that was rejected.
John Deakin, League of Wales Secretary, has taken over Evans's duties  temporarily, but said he had not heard that Evans had quit.
Deakin said: "I spoke to Alun this morning in the normal course of events.
"It was a perfectly normal conversation and he did not intimate to me that  he was on the point of resigning."
Meanwhile Gary Speed, who has damaged ankle ligaments, has joined  Manchester United's Ryan Giggs and Jeremy Goss of Norwich City in withdrawing  from the Welsh squad for the friendly international against Estonia in Tallinn  next Monday.
Ceri Hughes of Luton, Sheffield Wednesday's Ryan Jones and Manchester  United's Clayton Blackmore have been called into the squad to replace them.
