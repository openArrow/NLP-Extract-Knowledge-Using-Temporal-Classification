Two Asian cargo ships, each carrying around 20  crew, collided Saturday in the English Channel and one of the vessels was on  the point of sinking off Dover, British coastguards said.
Three helicopters, including one from the French coastguard, and rescue  vessels were on the way to the scene of the collision, which occurred at 2:30  p.m. (1330 GMT).
Dover coastguards were unable to provide further details about the  collision.
Rescue boats from Newhaven, Hastings and Eastbourne were alerted after  coastguards received distress calls from one of the ships.
Lloyd's underwriters in London named vessels in collision as the Tokyo  registered Ariake, carrying a cargo of fruit, and the Taiwanese-registered  container ship Ming Fortune.
According to Lloyd's the Ming Fortune was the more seriously damaged of  the two.
