Top-class midfielder Gheorghe Hagi holds the key to  rewriting Romania's history of World Cup disasters.
The country boasts a mere three wins in 12 final-round matches in the  competition, on top of 30 years when they failed to qualify for soccer's  showpiece.
Playmaker Hagi, however, nicknamed the "Maradona of the Carpathians", may  be just the man to take Romanian football to a higher plane.
Statistics suggest Anghel Iordanescu's side are on a roll, after cracking  in 29 goals during their qualifying matches.
That total was only bettered by Mexico's 30, prompting Iordanescu to  suggest: "We are better than 20 of the finalists. Qualifying was probably the  hardest part of it.
"Tournament play is another matter entirely. Look what Denmark did in the  European Championships."
Closer examination of the statistics, however, reveal that 11 of Romania's  goals came against the no-hopers from the Faroe Islands and another six were  put past Cyprus.
There is no doubt that Hagi, a star of the 199O finals, and key target man  Florin Raducioiu, the AC Milan-based author of nine goals during the cup  campaign so far, can make nonsense of any defense.
Iordanescu argues: "We have shown we can score at any time in the match.  That's important. It shows we can rouse ourselves if things are getting too  easy or can keep up the pressure against better sides."
Colombia, their opening opponents on June 18, and Switzerland, however,  will prove tougher nuts to crack.
Romania's task is not made any easier by their first round venues, which  will see them playing in different time zones in Los Angeles and Detroit.
Worse still, they seem unsettled by the indoor arena which will host the  Switzerland encounter.
Iordanescu, reinstated in time to lead Romania to the United States,  admits: "The preliminary group schedule will be our main enemy in the US."
