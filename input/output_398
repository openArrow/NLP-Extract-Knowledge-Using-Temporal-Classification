Scotland Yard detectives are to investigate the  theft of four million dollars (2.6 million pounds) from the United Nations  headquarters in Somalia, a police spokeswoman said early Saturday.
A team from the Yard's international and organised crime squad will fly to  the Somali capital, Mogadishu, early next week, said a Yard spokeswoman.
The UN called in Scotland Yard after the cash, used to pay the  international organisation's staff in the strife-torn African state, where  there are few banking facilities, disappeared from a filing cabinet at its  main compound in Mogadishu a month ago.
The spokeswoman stressed it was not unusual for international agencies to  draw upon the expertise of Scotland Yard officers in investigating crime  abroad.
But, although Scotland Yard detectives would question and possibly  fingerprint suspects, they were not authorised to make arrests, she said.
