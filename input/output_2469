US and Japanese negotiators went into a second  day of talks here Friday to try and break a three-month deadlock in bilateral  trade talks.
Both US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and the Japanese negotiators  were tight-lipped as they entered the USTR building for their third session  since Thursday morning.
Kantor had said Thursday that the talks had got off to a good start, but  would say only "the talks are continuing" as he entered the building Friday.
Japnese vice-minister at the International Trade and Industry Ministry,  Sozaburu Okamatsu, also said simply "we are going on."
The talks, originally scheduled to last only one day, are aimed at  reaching agreement on the ground rules for full resumption of talks in  reducing Japan's 60 billion dollar trade surplus under an accord reached in  July.
The talks collapsed in February in disagreement over how to measure  progress in opening Japan's market.
The US side was insisting on numerical targets which Japan rejected as  leading to managed trade and quotas.
Reports from Tokyo this week suggested the Japanese side might be bringing  proposals for a limited acceptance of such targets.
