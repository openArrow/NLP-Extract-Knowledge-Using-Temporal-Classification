Irish opposition deputies Monday denounced the  award of Irish nationality to a Saudi couple who invested 1.1 million pounds  (1.65 million dollars) in the family firm of Premier Albert Reynolds.
Michael McDowell, of the Progressive Democrats, charged that the couple  had bought Irish citizenship in order to conduct business deals in the  European Union. He announced he would be tabling a motion in the Dail  (parliament) aimed at revoking the move.
Philip Reynolds, the prime minister's son and director of the family  business in his father's constituency, admitted that Khalad Sabih Masri and  his wife had invested the cash in March 1992. But he said the naturalisation  issue had never arisen in negotiations prior to the investment.
In an interview with Irish television, Albert Reynolds denied there had  been any wrongdoing.
"I have never met this family, I do not know this family. I was never  involved in any way, shape or form with the transaction," he said.
