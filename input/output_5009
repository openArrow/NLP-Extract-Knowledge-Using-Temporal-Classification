The strength of links between France and Germany is  the driving force in Europe, whose structure would otherwise collapse, their  leaders said in remarks published Saturday ahead of a Franco-German summit.
President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl made the comments  in interviews published in regional newspapers ahead of the 63rd Franco-German  summit, due Monday and Tuesday.
"The friendship between Germany and France will always remain the motor of  European unity," said Kohl in the French daily L'Alsace, adding: "The motor is  working, it is turning over."
For Mitterrand, interviewed by the German Badische Zeitung, relations  between Bonn and Paris were "the keystone of the building" of the European  Union.
"What better example can there be than Franco-German relations to show the  superiority of a joint approach to problems?" he added.
The two men, who are to meet for the two-day summit in French town of  Mulhouse, near the Franco-German border, also stressed their commitment to an  enlarged European Union.
"I have always said that in the long-term the countries of central and  eastern Europe would join the Union, comprehensively, as equals and without  compromise," said Mitterrand.
"For the Germans and for me in particular it is inconceivable that  Poland's western border should remain, in the long term, the eastern border of  the European Union," Kohl said.
Mitterrand also denied that the imminent enlargement of the Union would  change France's and Germany's role at the heart of Europe. Austria, Sweden,  Norway and Finland are scheduled to join next January.
"Look at a map of Europe," said the French head of state. "Germany and  France will never have been more 'central,' in all senses of the word," he  said.
