At least 25 passengers were missing feared dead  after an overcrowded ferry capsized in southeast Bangladesh, the Ittefaq  newspaper reported Sunday.
The M/V Karim Shah, with some 300 passengers, capsized while closing on a  terminal in Sitakunda area's Sanwip Saturday, the newspaper said.
The missing included up to 18 women and children. Other passengers were  rescued or swam to safety, the Ittefaq said quoting police and witnesses.
Accidents involving ferries, the most popular transportation in  Bangladesh, have killed an estimated 4,000 people in 22 years.
A Dhaka daily, citing an official report, blamed accidents on overloading  or were guided by unskilled operators.
The state-owned Inland Water Transport Authority said some 60 million  people travel by ferries annually, and about five million tons of cargo are  shipped by ferry every year.
