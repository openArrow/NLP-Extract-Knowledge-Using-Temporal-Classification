A federal judge sentenced one of four Moslem  fundamentalists to 240 years in prison Tuesday for the bombing of the World  Trade Center last year.
Mohammed Salameh, 26, Mamud Abouhalima, 34, and Niddal Ayyad, 26, were  convicted March 4 of all counts in the February 26, 1993 attack, which killed  six people and injured more than 1,000.
Salameh, who drove the van that carried the bomb, was sentenced to 240  years in prison. The sentences of the other three were pending.
The judge said he arrived at the sentence by calculating the number of  years of life the victims were deprived of -- 180 by his estimate -- and then  added 30 years for each of the other two counts against him.
