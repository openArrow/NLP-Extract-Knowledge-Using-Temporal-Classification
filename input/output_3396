Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin cast doubt  Monday on Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) leader Yasser Arafat's  ability to administer the Palestinian autonomous areas of Jericho and the Gaza  Strip.
"He is not an easy partner. He has never had the responsibility of  managing the daily lives of nearly 800,000 Palestinians in all areas: health,  education, public services," Rabin told a visiting delegation of French  business leaders.
"He has never been held accountable for his management. Up to now, it was  he who gave money to people he chose himself," Rabin told the delegation led  by Francois Perigot, chairman of the French Council of Industry (CNPF).
"But donor countries like the United States, the European Union cannot  afford to finance the PLO without Yasser Arafat being obliged to explain how  the money is being used and unfortunately he has not realised this," Rabin  said when he met the delegation in parliament.
"The PLO has not set up the structures for administering this aid," Rabin  said referring to the 2.4 billion dollars in assistance pledged by the  international community through the World Bank to help the Palestinian economy  take off.
Rabin said the autonomy granted to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the  West Bank town of Jericho was a "test".  But he said "the Palestinian  Authority which is supposed to take over does not even have an address. There  is no leadership."
Rabin said he hoped "the Palestinians will realise that waving flags is  not enough to provide food for the people."
