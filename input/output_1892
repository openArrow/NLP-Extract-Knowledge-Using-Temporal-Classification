Some 300 people have died in recent weeks in  floods and landslides in southern and eastern China, reports said Thursday,  but warned that northern areas would be hard hit in this summer's rainy  season.
"Downpours and rainy storms have been lashing the southern provinces,"  said Minister for Water Resources Niu Maosheng, while the northern provinces  -- hit by a severe drought for several months -- were now in a "major rainy  spell," the China Daily said.
Niu said northern officials and farmers should "prepare for the worst," as  meteorologists warned that alternating periods of heavy rain and drought could  make this season's flooding even more destructive than in recent years.
The rainy season, which usually lasts from July and August, killed more  than 3,300 people in China last year and caused direct economic losses of 63  billion yuan (11 billion dollars).
