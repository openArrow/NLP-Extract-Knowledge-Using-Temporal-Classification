France launched its bid for the Cannes Film  Festival's top award Friday with the long-awaited "La Reine Margot," a lavish  historical drama billed as the most gripping film on the Croisette.
"What we are trying to do is grab the cinema audience and not to let them  go for a second," writer Daniele Thompson told AFP ahead of the premiere  Friday evening.
"It is a brutal film, like a thriller or a western. It is not a  sentimental film," he said, accurately describing the two and three-quarter  hour epic, full-blooded in more than one sense.
Starring Isabelle Adjani and Daniel Auteuil, the movie relates the gory  story of Marguerite of Valois, forced to marry for political expediency in  August 1572, in the heat of the French wars of religion.
From the opening frame the film pulls no punches in depicting the  brutality of the time, culminating in the Saint Bartholomew Day's Massacre of  August 23 and 24, when up to 100,000 protestants died.
Margot's sexual adventures -- her marriage puts no bars on these -- are  also included liberally in the mixture, a somewhat free interpretation of the  novel by Alexandre Dumas.
Thompson stresses that the role was written specifically for Adjani. "If  she had refused, I think we would not have had a film ... she is magnificent,"  he said.
The film, touted as France's best hope to try to regain the Golden Palm  for the first time in seven years, is premiered here Friday evening, at the  end of the first full day of the 47th Cannes International Film Festival.
