The Prince of Wales arrived here Friday to address  international business leaders and attend the last military parade of British  troops in Berlin as part of a one-day visit to the German capital.
His aircraft landed at RAF Gatow, which used to be a German Luftwaffe (air  force) academy until the Royal Air Force took it over at the end of World War  II and made it the airport of the British garrison.
British military sources said that Prince Charles flew the plane himself,  a BAE 146 of the Queens Flight.
The worlds busiest airport at the height of the Berlin Airlift in 1949,  RAF Gatow is to be handed back to the Luftwaffe when the last British forces  pull out of the city in September.
Prince Charles was first speaking to a seminar jointly organised by his  Prince of Wales Business Leaders Forum and Germanys Ost-West  Wirtschaftsakademie on social responsibility in emerging market economies.
He was later to take the salute at the Queens Birthday Parade, which will  be the last military parade staged by troops of the remaining 1,500 British  soldiers stationed in Berlin, who are all leaving by the end of September.
The heir to the British throne will also thank German civilian staff who  served the British troops, step through the famous Brandenburg Gate with  Berlin mayor Eberhard Diepgen and give a speech in the Berlin Rathaus (city  hall).
