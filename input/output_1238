At least four people were killed and 116 were  wounded in a four-hour battle between rival Afghan forces fighting for Kabul,  hospital sources said Tuesday.
Rockets and shells rocked the capital as forces loyal to Afghan President  Burhanuddin Rabbani defended their positions against attacking Uzbek troops, a  frontline commander said.
The pro-Rabbani commander said the Uzbeks launched the attack in Shour  Bazar in south Kabul in an abortive attempt to push toward the city centre,  firing a "hail of rockets" in advance of an infantry onsalught.
On the outskirts, some 30 kilometers (20 miles) northwest, the pro-Rabbani  forces clashed with the troops of Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar in Maidan  Shahr early Tuesday.
A soldier at the Jamhuriat hospital said an infantry regiment of Rabbani  had attacked the posts of Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami faction around Maidan  Shahr.
"We managed to capture some strategic hills in the area," he said,  claiming that heavy casualties were inflicted on the "enemy" forces.
The soldier did not give any figures and no comment was available from  Hekmatyar's camp.
The allied forces of Hekmatyar and Uzbek warlord General Abdul Rashid  Dostam have been fighting to seize control of Kabul and oust Rabbani from  power.
More than 1,500 people have been killed and thousands injured since the  fighting started in January.
