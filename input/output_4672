Rebel Grand Prix teams used a threatened  boycott of the Spanish Grand Prix to force the sport's ruling body to give  them power to decide on how to improve the safety of their car.
Earlier on Friday, the drivers had forced the authorities to improve an  emergency new chicane on what they considered a dangerous part of the  Catalunya circuit.
Max Mosley, president of the International Automobile Federationa, held a  crisis meeting at the Barcelona circuit with bosses of the rebel teams which  included Benetton, leading the world Championship, MacLaren and Williams.
Only four teams - Ferrari, Sauber, Tyrrell, Minardi and Larrouse - with  nine cars took part in the first practice session Friday morning.
But all the teams took part on the first qualifying session in the  afternoon.
McLaren spokesman Norman Howell said Mosley had agreed that powers on  technical changes should be held by the existing Formula One Technical Working  Group, strengthened by two more engineers and three drivers.
Rules changes which Mosley imposed unilaterally at the Monaco Grand Prix  two weeks ago will be subject to review by the group and can be overturned by  a majority vote.
Howell said the meeting agreed that while the rules changed invoked for  the Spanish race would be maintained, any team could decide not to race,  whithout penalty.
But changes decreed for the Candian race in Montreal in two weeks time,  notably increased protection for the drivers heads, will not be brought in  until the French Grand Prix on July 3, to allow for more intensive study.
Mosley's immediate comment after the meeting was that it had involved a  full and frank exchange of views.
"I understand it now the race meeting will continue in the normal way," he  added.
He made no immediate comment on the changes reported by Howell.
However, one leading team manager, who declined to be identified, said  that Mosley had in practice been removed from taking decisions in Formula One.
