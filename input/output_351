The Church of England said Friday it had lifted its  decades-old ban on investing its cash in South Africa, following the country's  first non-racial elections.
But the decision is unlikely to mean an immediate movement of substantial  sums into South African companies, said a statement for the Church  Commissioners, who deal with the Church of England's investments.
"The Commissioners aren't substantial overseas investors and it is  unlikely that we will start to invest in South Africa itself," the statement  said, adding: "...proper research and monitoring will continue to ensure any  potential investment conforms to ethical guidelines."
The ban was part of an "ethical investment" policy agreed in the 1960s.
