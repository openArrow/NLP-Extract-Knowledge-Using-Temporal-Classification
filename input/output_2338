South Africa's controversial National  Peace-keeping Force (NPKF), formed in February to replace police in black  townships, is to be disbanded, spokesman said Friday.
Defence ministry spokesman Charl de Klerk said the decision to end the  NPKF was taken Thursday at a meeting of the country's defence chiefs.
NPKF spokesman Connie van Rensburg said in a statement that an  announcement was expected next week, and he expected that the force would be  disbanded.
The force was established in February from members of the South African  police and defence force, the security forces of the black former homelands  and the African National Congress' military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe.
The NPKF was supposed to be deployed in townships where police had lost  the confidence of the local community, but its one foray into the townships  east of Johannesburg ended after less than a week, during which time violence  flared.
The force was hardly ever out of the headlines and reports of  ill-discipline, drunkeness, insubordination and deserting among the  peacekeepers were common.
Van Rensburg said it was most likely that members of the NPKF would end up  back in the forces they came from, with the Umkhonto members being placed in  the defence Force.
