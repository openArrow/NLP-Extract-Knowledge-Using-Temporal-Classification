US ambassador to Haiti William Swing  travelled to the Haitian-Dominican border Wednesday to get a glimpse of  reported gaps in the UN trade embargo on Haiti.
"I wanted to see first-hand what the traffic on the border looks like, and  to symbolize our resolve to tighten the enforcement of the UN sanctions  against Haiti," Swing said.
He visited the Haitian side of the border at Lake Azui, which straddles  the frontier, and spent 15 minutes eyeing the area through binoculars.
The lake is one of many points at which Haitians and Dominicans have been  doing a brisk trade in some essential goods, particularly oil and kerosene  which they ferry between the two sides.
The United States has eight warships off Haiti to enforece the UN embargo  designed to press Haiti's army rulers to step down, military sources in Puerto  Rico said.
One Canadian and one Argentine frigate also are taking part in the  enforcement effort.
Haiti's military ousted the country's first democratically elected  president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in September 1991.
US President Bill Clinton has said he would not rule out the use of force  to restore Haiti's democracy, and has listed what he called vital US interests  in Haiti.
A landing craft, the USS Wasp, left North Carolina Monday and was heading  to the Caribbean with 650 Marines on board, said a US military source.
About 15 other US vessels carrying a total 5,500 troops carried out  exercises off Puerto Rico last week. US military officials have stressed the  exercises were scheduled months in advance.
Sunday and Monday, US warships twice fired on ships that were trying to  slip into Haiti in violation of the trade embargo, according to the Pentagon.  One of the ships nonetheless managed to dock in Haiti.
