A shoot-out between Israeli  troops and Palestinian gunmen left four Gazans wounded on Sunday, Palestinian  sources said.
The army said only two Palestinians aboard a truck from which the attack  came were lightly wounded.
However according to doctors at Khan Yunes hospital, four people who  needed treatment for bullet wounds said they had been in a taxi when the  shooting started.
The attack took place near the settlement of Morag where the Islamic  Resistance Movement (HAMAS) claimed responsibility for seriously wounding an  Israeli truck driver last Thursday.
Israeli troops shot dead a Palestinian who was playing backgammon in a  doorway on a Gaza City street on Saturday night after they came under fire  from unknown assailants.
