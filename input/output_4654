Bosnian refugees might soon start to return home,  but this is unlikely to herald a mass influx of the estimated two million  Bosnians displaced by war, a UN refugee spokesman said Friday.
"The Bosnian government is pushing very hard for the return of refugees  but it's a question of legal conditions and of security conditions in the  region," said Peter Schatzer of the International Organization for Migrations,  a UN agency, at a press conference.
He said refugee officials wanted to map "safe" regions to ensure that  repatriated Bosnians were not caught in fighting or threatened with reprisal  attacks.
But Schatzer said certain specific groups, such as highly qualified  professionals who could help with the reconstruction of Sarajevo, might be  returned soon.
Another group could include some 1,000 Bosnian children who were sent to  Libya to flee the fighting, but whose parents want them home. Schatzer  mentioned no specific dates.
"We do not yet see the possibility for a massive return of a large number  of the maybe two million refugees" who fled Bosnia during the two years of  warfare, the spokesman said.
He said that issue would be tackled at a new meeting between UN  representatives and the Sarajevo government here in June.
