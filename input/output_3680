Malawian President Bakili Muluzi announced a new  cabinet Tuesday, picking mostly professionals and members of his ruling United  Democratic Front (UDF) party.
Muluzi fired the controversial inspector general of police, Mac William  Lunguzi, and appointed Feyani Chikosa as the new boss of the police force.
In a surprise appointment he named former diplomat and permanent secretary  Alfred Upindi as the new secretary of the decision-making office of the  president and cabinet.
Upindi replaces Macdonald Banda, who served under former president  Hastings Kamuzu Banda.
At a press conference, Muluzi said he created 20 ministerial positions and  left three vacant.
He picked Aleke Banda, a former aide to Banda and development aid  negotiator, as his finance minister and lawyer Peter Fachi as interior  minister.
Muluzi also named economist Tim Mangwazu minister of economic planning and  development.
George Kanyanya of the United Front for Multi-party Democracy (UFMD) was  made minister of labour and manpower development.
