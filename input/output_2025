A marble plaque in memory of seven Jewish  victims of French war criminal Paul Touvier has been found broken into pieces,  prompting accusations from a Jewish organisation that neo-Nazis were to blame.
The plaque, screwed on to a cemetery wall at Rillieux-La-Pape near here,  commemorated the reprisal shooting by the pro-Nazi militia of seven Jews on  June 29, 1944, on the orders of Touvier, who was Lyons militia intelligence  chief.
Touvier, 79, was sentenced to life imprisonment last April 19 for the  shooting, which was ruled a crime against humanity.
Gendarmes said Thursday they were making inquiries. No slogan or claim was  left at the scene. They said the plaque, which was due to be replaced, was  fragile and that a large stone would have been enough to break it.
Jean Levy, president of the Lyons section of the Jewish organisation CRIF,  on Wednesday expressed "indignation at this act committed by neo-Nazis after  the condemnation of Paul Touvier by the French people."
