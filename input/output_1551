The death of a China Airlines (CAL) co-pilot after  landing at Taiwan international airport where the radar system also went out  of action for 30 minutes heightened fears about air safety Wednesday.
Another incident involving a CAL airliner happened in Hong Kong on  Wednesday where a plane's hydraulic system broke down, the company said.  Taiwan airport was also put on the alert Wednesday when a plane belonging to  the private EVA Air company reported mechanical problems and returned to  Taiwan.
The co-pilot is thought to have died of a stroke after landing on Tuesday  night.
Lodge Lo, CAL public relations director, said the incident had nothing to  do with flight safety. "The plane already landed safely, and the pilot had  brought everything under control.... This incident should only be seen as an  isolated case."
Police and hospital officials said the pilot, Li Chang-an, was dead before  arriving in hospital. Prosecutors said doctors would perform an autopsy on Li  to determine the time of his death.
The radar system went down for 27 minutes in a separate incident. Ten  planes were kept in the air while the breakdown was repaired.
