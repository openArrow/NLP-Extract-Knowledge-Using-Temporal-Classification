Polish President Lech Walesa arrived Wednesday in  Switzerland for a three-day visit designed primarily to cement economic links.
The Polish leader, accompanied by his wife Danuta, was met at Zurich  airport by Swiss counterpart Otto Stich and his Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti.
Walesa was scheduled to have a series of meetings, culminating in a round  table discussion Friday with Swiss businessmen in Zurich.
Swiss sources described links between the two nations as "very good."  Poland is the main beneficiary of a Swiss aid programme to eastern European  countries.
Walesa and his wife were Thursday due to visit the town of Soleure, where  Polish liberation hero Tadeusz Kosciusko (1746-1817) spent the last few years  of his life.
On Friday, the couple hoped to visit the Polish museum at  Rapperswil  accompanied by Polish primate Cardinal Glemp, who is also visiting Switzerland.
