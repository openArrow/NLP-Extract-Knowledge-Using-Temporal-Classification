Rubber prices, depressed for years by  sluggish demand, are likely to bounce at least five percent by year-end as car  sales picked up and the European economy improved, officials said Tuesday.
"I am bullish that the market will remain good for the balance of this  year. Prices in the first five months are already well above last year's,"  said Aldo Hofmeister, the buffer stock manager of the International Natural  Rubber Organisation (INRO).
"The scenario for rubber is looking better now there are better automotive  sales in the United States, with Europe coming out of its recession and China  facing tight supply," Hofmeister told reporters after presenting his buffer  stock report to the INRO council, which began five day's of talks here Monday.
INRO groups six producing countries - Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia,  Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Sri Lanka -- with 20 consuming countries, including  members of the European Union, the United States, Japan and China.
It administers the 14-year old International Natural Rubber Agreement  (INRA) that guides the buffer stock manager's stock-piled operations to  stabilise rubber prices. INRA expired in December and has been extended for a  year pending conclusion of negotiations on a new successor pact.
Hofmeister, who is retiring in July, said he last bought rubber in  December, raising his stockpile to 220,000 tonnes.
INRO will have to choose by Friday his successor from six nominees, two of  whom were proposed by the United States and four from the European Union.
"By tradition, the three key posts in INRO, that of the buffer stock  manager, the executive director and his deputy, are held by the major  consumers and producers," said Hofmeister, whose two predecessors were from  the United States.
INRO sources said the selection could become a point of dissension among  consumers if the European Union did not give way.
