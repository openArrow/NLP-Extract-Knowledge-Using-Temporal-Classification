Britain's governing Conservative Party excised  personal attacks on John Smith from its campaign guide for next month's  European elections after the opposition leader's sudden death, a newspaper  reported Sunday.
The weekly Observer revealed that several passages were removed from the  internal party guide, which had been drafted at the beginning of May.
These included charges that "Mr. Smith has failed to live up to his  promise" and had shown "ineffectual and visionless leadership" at the head of  the Labour Party.
The original document also claimed that his 18 months at the head of the  party "have managed to make (former Labour leader Neil) Kinnock look like a  first-rate leader."
A Conservative Party spokesman said only minor passages had been altered  following Smith's unexpected death from a massive heart attack Thursday.
But the Observer report drew stinging criticism from Labour chairman David  Blunkett.
He said the guide had advised Conservative candidates for the Euro-poll to  say "very personal and unpleasant things which had little to do with the  policy differences we have on Europe."
He added: "This personal abuse contrasts with what has happened over the  last three days," during which tributes for Smith have poured in from both  sides of the political spectrum -- including moving speeches from Prime  Minister John Major.
All major parties have declared a truce in campaigning for the June poll  until after Smith's funeral Friday.
