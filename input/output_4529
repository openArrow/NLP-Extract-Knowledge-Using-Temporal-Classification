Thai police have issued warrants for the arrest of  two Iranians suspected of involvement in a plot to explode a booby-trapped  truck at the Israeli Embassy in March, police said Friday.
A police official identified the two Iranians as Mohammad Lotfollah and  Hossein Shahriarifar, both about 40 years old, who were believed to have fled  Thailand.
The official gave the names phonetically in Thai, saying there were no  written documents which implicated the two. He did not say how they were  believed to have been involved.
Thai translators were preparing an English version of the warrants for  transmission to Interpol, which has been asked to help, the official said.
The bomb plot was uncovered literally by accident March 17 when a rental  truck towed to a police station after a minor collision near the Israeli  Embassy in central Bangkok a few days earlier was found to be booby-trapped.
A large water tank on the back of the open-bed truck contained powdered  ammonium nitrate and C-4 plastic explosives wired to containers of diesel fuel.
The tank also contained the body of the rental company driver who had  delivered the vehicle to the would-be bombers.
