About 36 lawyers arrested in a crackdown have been  charged with attempting to overthrow the government and placed in police  custody, the Egyptian bar association said Thursday.
The lawyers, who were also charged with "inciting violence and illegal  gathering," could face execution if convicted in line with emergency laws  adopted in 1981 following the assassination of President Anwar Sadat.
At least 36 lawyers were arrested in 24 hours, the highest number of  lawyers ever held in one sweep in Egypt after police used tear-gas to stop a  march on Tuesday.
The march, organised by the association was in protest at the death in  police custody of a Islamist colleague, Abdel Hareth Madani. The lawyers were  also demanding the release of 34 colleagues detained before the demonstration.
Among the newly arrested lawyers is the main defence consul for the armed  Jamaa Islamiyya group Muntasser al-Zayat.
The interior ministry on Wednesday said documents relating to another  militant group, the "Al-Jihad" (holy war), were found in Zayat's home.
It added that videotapes on the history of the Moslem anti-Soviet guerilla  involvement in Afghanistan were seized in the home of another arrested lawyer,  Khaled Badawi.
President Hosni Mubarak has sworn to fight Moslem militants who launched a  violent campaign to topple his government more than two years ago. Nearly 400  poeple have been killed since, including 138 police and 144 militants.
A union body grouping doctors, lawyers, journalists and engineers called  on Thursday for an indefinite strike in Egyptian law courts until the arrested  lawyers are freed.
A large number of lawyers have been on strike for several days in protest  at Madani's death. He was the defence lawyer of the Moslem fundamentalist  spiritual leader Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman.
Initial medical reports said he died after being tortured, but the  interior ministry said later he had died from an asthma attack.
