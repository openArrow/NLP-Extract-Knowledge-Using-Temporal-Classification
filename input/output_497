White House officials dimissed  reports that President Bill Clinton and Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds  were to discuss Northern Ireland here on Saturday.
Clinton had invited Reynolds, who is in the United States on a trade trip,  to join him but officials insisted there would be no talks.
Reynolds was here anyway to speak at a university so the president invited  him to join him as a courtesy, said a White House official.
