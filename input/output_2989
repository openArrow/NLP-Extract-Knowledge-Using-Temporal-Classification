Leaders of communist parties in all but one of the  former Soviet republics concluded Sunday a two-day meeting on coordinating  strategy, news agencies reported.
The only country not represented was Kazakhstan.
The communist leaders met outside Moscow in Gorky-Leninskiye, the town  where Lenin died in 1924.
Gennady Zyuganov, head of the Russian communist party, told the ITAR-TASS  news agency that the parties wanted to form a permanent committee "with the  key task of resurrecting the Soviet Union."
The Soviet Union collapsed in December 1991.
