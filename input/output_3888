Moslem snipers have killed 31 civilians and  injured 66 others in the Serb-held region of the Bosnian capital since a  ceasefire went into effect in February, the Bosnian Serb SRNA news agency  reported Wednesday.
The agency, citing Serb military sources, said the mainly Moslem Bosnian  army had violated the February 9 ceasefire in Sarajevo at least 400 times  since it went into effect.
The ceasefire was signed by the two warring factions after NATO threatened  air strikes unless heavy weapons were pulled outside a 20-kilometre exclusion  zone around the city.
