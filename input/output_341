Northern leaders rejected late Friday a southern  ceasefire plan to end fighting which has opposed rival forces for the past  nine days, an official spokesman told AFP.
The spokesman said by telephone from the Yemeni capital Sanaa that there  was "nothing new" in the seven-point plan put forward in Aden by the southern  Yemen Socialist Party.
