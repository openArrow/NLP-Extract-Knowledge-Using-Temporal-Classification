Britain's opposition Labour Party on Saturday  demanded an explanation of why Iranian charge d'affaires Gholamreza Ansari was  reportedly being expelled from Britain.
The Guardian daily said Ansari had been given the order to leave after a  meeting with Foreign Office Minister of State Douglas Hogg.
Iran's intelligence service has recently been accused of making contact  with the banned Irish Republican Army (IRA), which is waging a bloody campaign  to divorce Northern Ireland from Britain.
Government officials said Iran and Britain had reached an agreement not to  say anything about the affair.
Both sides are apparently anxious to avoid another break in ties, which  were cut in 1989 after the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini  issued a death warrant against British author Salman Rushdie for allegedly  blaspheming Islam in his book "The Satanic Verses."
Diplomatic relations were restored the following year.
Labour's shadow foreign minister, Kim Howells, who looks after his party's  Middle East brief, told reporters: "What is the purpose of secrecy? I do not  think it looks very good for Britain to be involved in any kind of secret deal  with a nation which has been described as administering a killing machine."
