Estonian Defence Minister Indrek Kannik was sacked  Thursday after his policy differences with the ruling coalition came to a  head, the government press service said, cited by the Interfax news agency.
The government statement said Kannik had been ousted for attempting to  "provoke a split within the government," adding that he could no longer "work  in cooperation with the governing coalition."
Politicals leaders within the coalition have been calling for his  dismissal for several days.
The executive of the Isamma-Pro Patria party, one of the coalition  members, has been pressing for the resignation of the entire government,  including Prime Minister Mart Laar.
However, the premier has so far resisted the call, instead choosing to  distance himself from Kannik.
