The British Broadcasting Corporation announced  Monday that it was suspending its scheme awarding honeymoon gifts to  homosexuals as well as heterosexuals after an uproar among rightwing  Conservative MPs.
The scheme, granting gay employees a week's paid holiday for a "honeymoon  break" with their partners as well as a 75 pound bonus (112,5 dollars) would  be suspended, as would the same entitlement to straight couples.
On Sunday, the BBC announced that, in line with its equal opportunities  policy, it had "decided to extend the marriage leave provision to include same  sex partners, and heterosexual couples who undergo a formal ceremony of  commitment, in addition to the already existing provision for legally  recognised marriages."
Rightwing MPs from Prime Minister John Major's Conservative Party called  on National Heritage Secretary Peter Brooke, whose office oversees the BBC, to  threaten the corporation with a cut in the licence fee which finances it, if  it did not overturn its decision.
"We seem to have gone raving mad," said Tory rightwinger Geoffrey Dickens.  He called the move "ludicrous and outrageous."
The gay pressure group OutRage said Monday the decision to suspend the  scheme was a "sad retreat" and the broadcasting employees' union Bectu said it  was "hasty."
The union called for the scheme to be reintroduced for all employees  regardless of their sexuality.
