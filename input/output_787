The Yemen Socialist Party of southern Yemen  leader Ali Salem al-Baid, backed by five opposition parties, made a new  ceasefire offer Sunday in the civil war against northern Yemeni followers of  President Ali Abdallah Saleh.
Baid announced the new initiative, aimed at creating a "government of  national salvation," at a press conference along with leaders of the five  opposition parties, three of which are based in the north.
A similar ceasefire offer Friday was rejected by Saleh, whose forces are  advancing on this southern economic capital.
Saleh demanded the surrender of the southern leaders and recognition of  his national leadership as a precondition to any cessation of hostilities.
"This initiative in a historic step towards saving the country," Baid  said, adding that his followers "are opposed to war ... but will fight the  invaders."
Baid released a document titled "Agreement in principle for national  salvation," which set out as its primary goal "to save the country and  preserve the national unity" achieved when North and South Yemen merged in  1990.
The agreement calls for implementing a north-south reconciliation plan  agreed between the two sides in talks last February in Amman but which was  never put into action.
The three northern parties signing the agreement were moderate Islamic  Al-Haq and Union of People's Forces and the Unionist Organization.
In other developments a delegation from the Arab League met in Sanaa  Sunday with Deputy Prime Minister Abdel Wahab al-Ansi, head of the  fundamentalist al-Islah movement, the official SABA news agency reported from  the Yemen capital.
The agency said only that the talks dealth with "developments" in Yemen.
The Sanaa government has rejected foreign mediation of the civil war and  the Arab League delegation has not met with Saleh.
