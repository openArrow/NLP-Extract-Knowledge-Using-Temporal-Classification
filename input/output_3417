An earthquake near Taiwan registering 6.8 on the  Richter scale shook several islands in Japan's southernmost prefecture of  Okinawa on Tuesday, the Meteorological Agency said.
The agency issued a tsunami tidal wave warning along the coasts of the  islands, an agency official said.
There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage in the quake which  occurred at 1 p.m. (0400 GMT), police said.
The intensity of the tremor registered three on the Japanese scale of  seven at Yonakuni and Iriomote islands, the agency said. A quake at the level  of three can shake wooden houses and rattle doors and windows.
Later, the agency said it called off the tidal wave warning, about one  hour after it issued it.
