The Cannes film festival had the cameras  turned on itself Wednesday in a French bid for the Golden Palm which brought  some much-appreciated humour to the competition here.
"Grosse Fatigue" (Very Tired) by Michel Blanc includes appearances by  Gilles Jacob, director of the world's biggest filmfest, as well as sundry  other notables from the world of French celebrities.
At one point Blanc, playing himself, arrives at the prestigious Majestic  Hotel on the Croisette seeking a room. He is told there are none, but demands  the room of Gerard Depardieu, whom he knows to be absent.
Enter Jacob to sort things out. "I sent him the script and he
had the good humour to accept. I was bowled over," Blanc told AFP. "He had  his lines perfectly. There was no hesitation."
The film overall tells the story of Blanc's attempts to extricate himself  from accusations of having committed a rape, with the gradual realization that  a double is carrying out various acts in his name.
It includes such French celebrities as Roman Polanski, Carole Bouquet and  Charlotte Gainsbourg -- all appearing as themselves.
"I wrote it thinking about them. It was necessary to do so because I  wanted to use the image which the public has of them but which is not them. I  wanted to make a certain caricature of what we are," Blanc said.
Reaction to the movie, premiered Wednesday evening, was muted. "Very  French for the French, name-dropping," was a common comment, suggesting it may  have a limited appeal in the wider cinema world.
Also premiered here Wednesday, a generally slow day for the festival still  waiting for a real front runner in the main competition here, was Italian  Mario Brenta's "Barnabo delle Montagne" (Barnabo of the Mountains).
