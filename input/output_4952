Iran on Saturday banned all importers from buying  hard currency on the open market in a bid to cut demand for the dollar and  halt the slide of the rial.
The new measure, which caps a series of efforts to curb imports, requires  all foreign purchases to be ordered instead through the country's state  banking system, the central bank said.
It also requires importers to register their orders at the commerce  ministry and present a certificate of exchange from the banks before being  able to release their goods from the customs office, it said.
In the past two months, the ministry has been authorizing the release of  imported goods only if the owner deposited an equal amount of cash at the bank.
These restrictions, often costly and time-consuming, had so far applied  only to state companies, while private importers could still turn to the open  market for their hard currency.
The latest measure is designed to further tighten imports, which have  dropped from 23 billion dollars in 1992 to seven billion dollars last year,  according to official figures.
The restrictions on imports have been adopted to cut private demand for  hard currency and enable the government to repay some 30 billion dollars in  short and medium-term foreign debts.
The fall in imports also came as Iran's trade partners refused to honor  Iranian letters of credit after the country came up with a payment arrears of  some 13 billion dollars.
Iran has since managed to reschedule or refinance some seven billion  dollars of its debts, but it will have to pay the trade partners from four to  five billion dollars by the year 2000.
Tehran earned about 14 billion dollars in hard currency in 1993, mainly  through oil sales, according to Western economic experts in Tehran.
Another aim of the new measure is to curb the activities of the open  currency market, which is often blamed for the rial losing about 50 percent of  its value against foreign currencies since November.
Several certificated money-changers in the capital have stopped their  operations, with many others expected to follow suit.
Speaking to AFP on Saurday, one money-changer said the government was  running the risk of creating a black market by cracking down on authorised  dealers.
