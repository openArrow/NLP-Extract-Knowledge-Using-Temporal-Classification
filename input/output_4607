Serbia has asked to attend next week's meeting of  foreign ministers from the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), Egyptian Foreign  Minister Amr Mussa said Friday.
Egypt is opposed to Serbia's membership of the movement, but Mussa said  the request would be studied by senior NAM officials on the eve of the  conference.
Several NATO members have asked to send observers to the three-day  conference which begins on Tuesday, said Mussa.
He recently described Serbia as "a country which violates international  law," and said it was not the only state to have emerged from the former  Yugoslavia.
