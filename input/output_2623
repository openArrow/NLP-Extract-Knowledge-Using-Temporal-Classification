Pennsylvania native Missie Berteotti  carded a six-under-par 66 here Friday to grab the first-round lead over four  other players in the Lady Keystone Open golf tournament.
"It was a good day," said Berteotti, who could be the first woman from the  state to win the 20-year-old event.
"I made some good putts today, but I drove the ball pretty well, too.  Everything was right there."
Brandie Burton, Elaine Crosby, Noelle Daghe and Judy Dickinson shared  second on 69.
Another big bunch were on 70, including Briton Laura Davies, who is fresh  from victory in the LPGA Championship.
Berteotti claimed her second birdie of the day at the third hole, with a  difficult 22-foot uphill putt.
She moved to four under with birdies at seven and eight, and picked up  another stroke at the 11th.
She gave one shot back at 12, her lone bogey of the day, but birdied 15  and 16.
Michelle Estill was her only real challenger. She set a tournament record  with consecutive eagles on 15 and 16, but three bogeys dropped her into the  group on 70.
