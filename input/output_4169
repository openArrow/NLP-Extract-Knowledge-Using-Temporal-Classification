Some 30 people were wounded in an artillery duel  between rival Afghan forces overnight, hospital sources said Thursday.
The two-hour exchange in the northern part of Kabul came after a lull in  fighting between forces loyal to President Burhanuddin Rabbani and an alliance  opposing him during the Moslem Eid festival.
According to a recent International Committee of the Red Cross estimate,  about 2,500 people have died and 17,000 have been wounded since Uzbek general  Abdul Rashid Dostam, in tandem with Afghan Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar,  launched an offensive against the Rabbani government in January.
While no frontline clashes were reported Thursday, soldiers clashed with a  group of four robbers trying to flee with their booty.
Witnesses said crossfire between the soldiers and the looters at an  intersection in central Kabul caused several civilian casualties at a nearby  bazaar.
They said said the robbers, believed to be from Kandahar province, jumped  from a taxi as it was hit by shots fired by the soldiers and managed to escape  after a gunbattle.
A Kandahar commander, an ally of the president, is said to have sent his  fighters to Kabul three months ago to help pro-Rabbani forces defend the  capital.
