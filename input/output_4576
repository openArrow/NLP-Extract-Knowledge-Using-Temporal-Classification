A war of words between North and South Korea  escalated Friday as President Kim Young-Sam called for tighter vigilance  against possible military provocations by the Stalinist North.
"North Korea has reached an extremely difficult stage that goes beyond our  imagination," Kim was quoted as saying by Yonhap news agency in a speech  during a visit to a frontline airbase.
"This is a very dangerous period when the North could start trouble at any  minute," Kim said, calling for a tight defense posture.
He said that despite a severe oil shortage, North Korea's air force  recently stepped up training flights, flying its jets close to the border with  the South.
In a related development, South Korea Friday flatly rejected the North's  call for a pan-national rally to commemorate Korea's liberation from Japanese  colonial rule on August 15.
The government National Unification Board (NUB) said in a statement: "It  is obvious that the most pressing task for Pyongyang is to clear up suspicions  about its intent to develop nuclear weapons."
Kim's remarks came a day after the North accused him of trying to drive a  wedge between Pyongyang and Washington before planned US-North Korea  high-level talks, expected to be held early next month.
The talks will discuss ways to improve US-North Korea ties and to end  North Korea's standoff with the international community over its suspected  nuclear weapons development program.
North Korea in turn snubbed Kim's call for the resumption of an  inter-Korean dialogue, taking issue with his statement last year that he would  not shake hands with anyone suspected of having nuclear weapons.
In a recent press interview, Kim urged the North to come back to the  dialogue table with the South, instead of talking only to the US, in order to  resolve the nuclear issue.
The North's mouthpiece, the Korea Central News Agency (KCNA), on Thursday  accused Kim of trying to put the brakes on rapprochement betweeen Pyongyang  and Washington.
