The collapse of a three-million-dollar  bogus billing scam landed a former naval chief petty officer in jail here  Thursday.
James McGill, 53, sobbed and apologized to his family as US District Judge  John A. MacKenzie jailed him for seven years.
"I was selfish in what I did. I apologize to all of you," said McGill.
Authorities indicted McGill in January on 430 counts of filing false  claims, mail fraud, money laundering and tax evasion. He pleaded guilty in  February under an agreement with the government.
McGill, who was a supply clerk with 22 years in the navy, used his  knowledge of navy requistion methods to defraud the government. After leaving  the navy in 1981 he joined the merchant marines on Military Sealift Command  ships until he resigned in 1990.
In 1989 he began a scheme lasting four years, submitting false claims to  the navy for payment on supplies that were never ordered.
His ficticious company, Universal Supply and Services Inc., took in over 3  million dollars from the navy. He received over 100 checks ranging from 7,400  dollars to 60,000 dollars.
The scam fell apart when someone noticed he submitted requests for a ship  in storage.
McGill spent some of the money on gambling and opening a restaurant, but  gave most of it away to his church and friends. He agreed to repay the  remaining money.
