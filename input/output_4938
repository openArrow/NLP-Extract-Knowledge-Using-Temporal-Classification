The United States will keep up the pressure on  Beijing over human rights, despite de-linking the issue from trade, US  Secretary of State Warren Christopher has pledged.
Christopher, addressing the Asia Society here late Friday, the day after  Washington renewed the most favoured nation (MFN) status for China for another  year, said that the United States would not rely "on the invisible hand of  economics alone" when dealing with Beijing.
"Our advocacy will be strong and firm and determined, because we're not  backing away in any respect from our human rights policy."
"We realise there are serious human rights problems and we're going to be  pursuing them," he added.
Christopher notably said Washington would step up diplomacy with China,  encourage human rights defense groups, set up a new Radio Free Asia, and  encourage US companies to develop and respect a code of business principles.
Justifying the renewal of MFN, he said that the decision was taken to  avoid a "downward spiral" in relations with China.
"We must intensify and broaden our engagement with China if we want to  promote peaceful change there," he said.
Announcing the renewal of MFN on Thursday, US President Bill Clinton  backed off a threat to revoke the trading privileges if China did not  significantly improve its human rights record.
He acknowledged that abuses persisted but said it was not in Washington's  interests to disrupt a 40 billion dollar a year trade relationship.
