Henri Leconte, finalist in 1988, crashed out of the  French Open on Monday and admitted: "I'm too slow."
Leconte, now 30 and one of the most spectacular but erratic strokeplayers  of recent years, went down in straight-sets to Dutchman Paul Haarhuis on  Roland Garros' new 10,000-capacity 'A' court on the first day of the 1994  Championships.
"The new players are playing faster and I am playing slower," he admitted.
"It's tough to feel you are slower but that's the way it is. I feel pain  all the time and I have had many operations. It's not going to get any easier.
"I love playing tennis but I don't know what the future will hold or even  if I shall be able to play here again," he said.
Haarhuis reached a second round clash against Swedish qualifier Lars  Jonnson who put out compatriot Mikael Pernfors.
Pernfors, who reached the final as an unseeded player in his first French  Open in 1986, was trailing by two sets to love in the third set when he  retired with a foot injury.
