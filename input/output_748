Commonwealth observers supervising Malawi's first  multi-party elections said Sunday that they had received reports of campaign  violations in the run-up to Tuesday's polls.
The head of the 11-strong Commonwealth observer group, former Malaysian  minister Dato Musa Hitam, said at a press conference Sunday that he had  received reports of "various violations by parties" in several districts.
He said observers would "consider the various factors impinging on the  credibility of the electoral process as a whole and determine whether  conditions exist for a free expression of will by the electors."
The official electoral commission last month reported campaign violations  in nine of the country's 24 voting districts.
The commission, led by supreme court judge Anastasia Msosa, blamed the  ruling Malawi Congress Party for most of the violations, including seizing or  buying voter registration cards.
Some 290 international observers are monitoring the poll, in which some  3.8 million electors will elect a legislature and a president.
Eight parties and four presidential candidates will context the first  multi-party vote since Malawi gained independence in 1964. The country has  been ruled since independence by President Kamuzu Banda.
Campaigning ended early Sunday after opposition groups held several  rallies in the country's main towns.
The rest of the day was to be dedicated to "prayer and hope", with several  thousand people gathering at Blantyre stadium to pray for peace.
In keeping with electoral commission rules, counting will begin  immediately the polls close. The results will be broadcast by radio, but  official returns are not expected until Thursday.
