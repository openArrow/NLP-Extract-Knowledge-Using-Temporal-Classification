Shining Path guerrillas set off bombs outside seven  banks around Lima late Thursday injuring four people and causing widespread  damage, police said.
One of the injured was taken to hospital, the sources said.
The blasts, heard throughout the city, caused heavy damage to some of the  buildings. In the Surquillo suburb, one explosion shattered windows in a  100-meter (yard) radius, police said.
Blackouts spread accross some neighborhoods south of central Lima after  guerrilla commandos damaged power lines.
Witnesses said rebel leaflets hailing the upcoming 14th anniversary of  their movement were strewn around some of the bomb sites.
Police said the attacks were part of the Shining Path's "celebrations"  leading up to their May 17 anniversary.
The Maoist rebel movement, seemingly unshaken by a three-year government  crackdown that netted and jailed its founder and leader Abimael Guzman, has  been blamed for 25,000 deaths in the past 14 years.
