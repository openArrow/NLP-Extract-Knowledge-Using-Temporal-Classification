US and Japanese negotiators will meet here  Thursday to discuss the trade dispute that has soured relations between the  world's two largest economic powers, the US trade representative said Monday.
US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said "we'll expect good and serious  and far-reaching and far-ranging negotiations."
Earlier talks broke down in February when then-Japanese prime minister  Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton failed to see eye-to-eye at a  White House summit meeting.
The so-called framework agreement negotiations collapsed because of a  dispute over how to measure progress in opening Japan's market and reducing  its 60-billion-dollar trade surplus with the United States.
Kantor had said Friday that he had reached agreement with Japanese Foreign  Minister Koji Kakizawa on the need for preliminary contacts aimed at reviving  bilateral trade talks.
In Tokyo, officials said Kakizawa had agreed to resume the stalled  framework talks.
The framework agreement between the two countries targets four key sectors  as crucial to slashing the Japanese trade surplus. They are automobiles,  insurance, telecommunications and medical equipment.
The February talks broke down over Japan's refusal to accept the principle  of set numerical targets to track how much Tokyo was doing to open up its  domestic markets.
