Colombia, who cut a stylish path to the World Cup  finals, come to the United States with double mission -- to win, and to polish  a national reputation tarnished by association with the drugs trade.
The Colombians, with their superb ball skills and technique, have been  tipped as dark horse candidates by many, from Brazilian legend Pele to  European Footballer of the Year Roberto Baggio.
"They play the most attractive soccer in the world and could win the  tournament," the Italian striker says.
Baggio cited Faustino Asprilla, of 1993 European Cup Winners' Cup  champions Parma, plus fellow strikers Freddy Rincon and Adolfo Valencia.
It was a goal from Asprilla last season which ended AC Milan's 58-match  unbeaten run in the Italian League.
Gifted and unpredictable, he can beat opponents and has a tremendous  right-foot shot. He has been known to have fits of pique, and stormed out of a  World Cup training camp last August after a disagreement with manager  Francisco Maturana.
He missed one of Parma's 1993 Cup Winners' Cup matches with a gashed leg  -- an injury he was rumoured to have suffered when he kicked in a bus window  after a wild night out.
Flamboyant midfielder Carlos Valderrama, the captain, was included in the  22-man squad after recoving from a serious knee injury suffered in February.
Valderrama, South American footballer of the year in 1987, is a textbook  passer of the ball, recognizeable not only by his playmaking, but also by his  red hair.
Back in 1990, the Colombians went to Italy just happy to have made the  finals.
After their success in South American qualifying, which included a 5-0  victory over Argentina in Buenos Aires, Colombian players and fans are  expecting more.
