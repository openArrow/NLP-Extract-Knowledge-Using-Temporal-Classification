Newly democratic South Africa and war-torn  Angola on Friday raised their diplomatic relations to ambassadorial level,  concluding the normalisation of ties.
The agreement was signed in Cape Town by South African Foreign Minister  Alfred Nzo and his Angolan counterpart Venancio de Moura.
When Angola was wracked by civil war after independence in 1975, white  minority-ruled South Africa backed Angolan rebels militarily and financially,  sending troops who were withdrawn in 1987.
Initial ties between South Africa and the formerly Marxist government in  Luanda were sealed in 1992 when UN-supervised elections were held in Angola  under a peace pact signed in May 1991.
But rebels of Jonas Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola (UNITA) plunged the country back into civil war after they lost the  general elections.
