Russian media organisations protested en masse  Wednesday against the Ukrainian authorities' withdrawal a day earlier of  accreditations from three of their colleagues.
In a statement published through the ITAR-TASS agency, signatories from  leading print and broadcast media organisations accused Kiev of "riding  roughshod over press freedoms."
The statement demanded that Kiev ensure "all conditions" necessary for  journalists to carry out their jobs in Ukraine were in place.
The Kiev foreign ministry withdrew accreditations Tuesday from three  journalists working for Russia's state Ostankino television network, accusing  them of having failed to report "objectively" the current political crisis  between Ukraine and Crimea.
The text was signed by directors of Ostankino, ITAR-TASS, the chairman of  the Russian Federation's media commission -- formerly the information ministry  --, the union of Russian journalists, the association of newspaper editors,  and editorial representatives of Izvestia, Komsomolskaya Pravda, Rossiyiskaya  gazeta and Obshaya gazeta.
Under the ban, the three journalists can continue to report from Ukraine  but have been barred from official Ukrainian buildings and press conferences.
Ostankino broadcasts across most of the territory of the former Soviet  Union.
