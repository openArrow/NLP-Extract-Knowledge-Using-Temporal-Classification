Taiwan has decided to lift its overall ban on  package tours to China following local travel agencies' reluctance to adhere  to the government ruling because of their heavy financial losses, a local  newspaper said Sunday.
But some regional exclusions will remain in force.
After discussions with the Tourism Bureau here, the economic affairs  director of the cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) agreed to ease  the restrictions, the Economic Daily News reported.
The director, Chen Ming-chang, told the newspaper the MAC would end its  blanket ban on all package tours to the mainland organised by Taiwan travel  agencies, but tours would still not be permitted to certain areas.
Taiwan television stations would be told to broadcast warnings to the  public about the potential risks of travel in China and ask people to refrain  from visiting the designated areas.
Chen was not available for comment on Sunday.
Taiwan imposed the ban in retaliation for what it claimed was an attempted  cover-up by China of the facts surrounding the death of 24 Taiwanese tourists   during a boat trip in Qiandao Lake in eastern China on March 31. Their vessel  was largely destroyed by a fire.
Beijing originally insisted that it was an accident but later announced  that it was a case of robbery with murder and arson and arrested three men  following Taiwan's suspension of cultural and educational exchanges with China  and its decision to review its economic policies towards the mainland.
Local travel agencies complained that they have lost more than 700 million  Taiwan dollars (26.4 million US) since mid-April after cancelling organized  tours to the mainland at the government's request.
