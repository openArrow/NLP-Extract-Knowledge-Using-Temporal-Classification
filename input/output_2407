China directly criticised a US news agency Friday  for what it described as a "fabricated" story regarding the possible future  trial of the country's most celebrated dissident Wei Jingsheng.
In a statement carried by the official Xinhua news agency, a public  security ministry spokesman voiced "indignation" over a United Press  International (UPI) report that the ministry had confirmed a government  decision "to start the indictment process with Wei Jingsheng."
"Some news media just fabricated the news without an interview in order to  fool readers," the spokesman said, adding that this went "against the ethics  of journalism and reflects ulterior motives."
The condemnation of the American news agency comes at a time when Sino-US  relations are extremely strained over the dispute surrounding Washington's  renewal of China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) trading status with the United  States.
President Bill Clinton must decide by June 3 whether China has made  necessary progress in human rights to warrant MFN renewal.
Specific criticism of a foreign media organisation is usually carried out  privately and only rarely disseminated by the official Chinese media.
A UPI correspondent said the ministry had contacted their Beijing bureau  earlier in the day to deliver the same message.
The spokesman's comments were limited to rejecting the report that the  public security ministry had "confirmed" that Wei would be put on trial, and  made no reference to a previous UPI report quoting justice ministry sources as  saying the dissident was to be tried for treason.
However, a foreign ministry spokesman on Wednesday said investigations  into Wei's case were continuing and dismissed suggestions that a treason trial  was imminent as "sheer fabrication."
