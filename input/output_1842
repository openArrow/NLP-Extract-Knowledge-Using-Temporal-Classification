General Humberto Ortega, the left-wing leader who  has headed the army for the last 15 years despite a change in government, will  leave his post next February 21, President Violeta Chamorro said Wednesday.
Ortega's presence as head of the armed forces has been a source of  controversy, provoking criticism from the United States and elsewhere that the  brother of ex-president Daniel Ortega wielded considerable authority despite  the 1990 elections lost by the left-wing Sandinistas.
After her election, Chamorro decided to keep Ortega in his job in a  gesture of fence-mending at the end of a civil war, but the move cost her  support at home and abroad.
Chamorro made the announcement at a cereony marking the 99th anniversary  of the birth of general Augusto Cesar Sandino, who inspired the Sandinista  movement.
A replacement for Ortega will be named December 21, allowing a two-month  transition period.
The president had previously said Ortega would be replaced but had not yet  set a date for the change. She has also announced plans for reorganizing the  military to ensure it remains under civilian control.
Ortega, who was present at the ceremony, said the reform was aimed at  "giving us a chance to get along and help Nicaragua."
