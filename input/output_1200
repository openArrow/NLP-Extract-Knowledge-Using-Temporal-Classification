Insurgents attacked a road convoy in  northern Laos and killed an Australian working for an electricity concern and  a Laotian civilian, the Tasmanian Hydro-Electric Commission (HEC) said Tuesday.
Phil Hickey, 40, died instantly in the attack Monday, HEC chief executive  Graeme Longbottom said.
A Laotian working for an Australian construction company was also killed  in the incident about 70 kilometers (40 miles) north of Vientiane.
It was insurgents used grenade launchers against the convoy, which  included three Laotian army vehicles and a civilian truck in which Hickey and  the Laotian civilian was travelling, Longbottom said.
Some Laotian soldiers may have been killed in the attack, he said.
Hickey was doing survey work for a power scheme following an agreement on  a dam and tranmission grid signed in April between the Laotian government and  the HEC.
