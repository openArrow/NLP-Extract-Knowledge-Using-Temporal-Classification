His two late goals against Romania, his outfoxing of eccentric Colombian  keeper Rene Higuita before scoring, and a superb performance against England  in Naples elevated him to hero status.
England's Stanley Matthews is the oldest international. He was two months  older than the 42-year-old Milla will be when he played Denmark in 1957.
But Milla can beat Dino Zoff's World Cup record. The goalkeeper was 40  when he captained Italy to the 1982 World Cup. Whether Milla does break the  record will probably only be known when the Cameroon side walks out to play  Sweden at the Pasadena Rose Bowl on June 19.
Cameroon, however, seem to thrive on adversity and even though they failed  to qualify for the African Nations Cup won by Nigeria in April they remain  optimistic.
Omer Nguewa, Cameroon chairman of selectors with the power to fire Michel,  has made things quite clear.
"We want results. We believe we are good enough to be contesting the  semi-finals this time," he said.
Though Cameroon lost after outplaying England in the last World Cup, it  was the best showing by any African team ever and it guaranteed Africa a third  place in the 1994 tournament.
Africa's football governing body CAF is urging at least an extra two, and  possibly three extra places now that France's 1998 World Cup will be increased  to 32 teams.
