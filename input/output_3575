Russia has asked the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and  Saudi Arabia to try and "exert their influence" in the Yemeni conflict, the  foreign ministry here said Tuesday.
"Moscow is watching with anguish developments (in Yemen) and once again  calls on the parties involved to stop the senseless bloodshed," ministry  spokesman Grigori Karasin said during a press briefing.
Karasin's statement came as the UAE implied Tuesday it recognized the  breakaway state of south Yemen, whose leader Ali Salem al-Baid announced  secession from unified Yemen last week after two weeks of civil war.
Karasin said that the last Russian citizens still in Yemen would be  evacuated in coming days. Some 900 Russians were living in Yemen before the  civil war erupted there.
