Taiwan's state-run China Steel Corp. (SCS) and MEMC  Electronic Materials Inc. of the United States signed Tuesday an agreement to  form a 4.85 billion Taiwan dollar (180.6 million US) joint-venture to make  silicon wafers here, economic officials said.
The contract was signed by CSC chairman Wang Chung-yu and MEMC president  Robert Standfort to establish a plant to manufacture six-inch and eight-inch  silicon wafters, a basic component of semiconductors, the officials said.
"MEMC will provide state of the art technology and manufacturing expertise  for large diameter silicon wafters necessary to fuel this new enterprise,"  said Tommy Cadwell, MEMC's president of Asian operations.
The Missouri-based firm, a subsidiary of Germany's Huls Group, will hold a  45-percent stake in the joint-venture, located at the Hsinchu Science and  Industrial Park in northern Taiwan.
The CSC will have 35 percent in the joint venture, with the remaining 20  percent shared by state-run Chiao Tung Bank and the China Development Corp.
The planned plant, covering 4.8 hectares (11.6 acres), will start  operation in 1997.
Taiwan imports more than three billion dollars worth of silicon wafers a  year to meet local demand, 60 percent of them supplied by Japan.
