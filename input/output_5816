Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata expressed optimism  Tuesday as Japan prepared to resume trade talks with the United States, with a  promise to ease regulations and open its markets.
"It will never be easy," he told the National Press Club about the talks  which broke down in February due to Japan's rejection of US demands for  "numerical targets" in gauging the opening of its markets.
But he added: "I am convinced that the things will no doubt move in a  favourable direction."
He reaffirmed Japan would pursue "deregulation and market-opening" above  everything" such as approval for sales of cellular phones -- which could only  be leased until April 1 -- and easier inspections and certifications of  automobiles.
"But it will be a painful process and a difficult task," he said.
Japan agreed last week to reopen trade talks with the US side, calling for  establishment of "objective criteria" in gauging progress in market-opening.
Earlier Tuesday, the Japanese trade minister renewed his opposition to  setting numerical targets in the Japan-US trade negotiations, saying that the  targets would never be "a practical resolution."
Eijiro Hata -- not related to the prime minister -- told reporters that  Japan could not accept any proposals to set numerical targets, which would  lead to managed trade.
Commenting on possible pressure to accept numerical targets in sectorial  talks, he said: "That's something the private sector should take care of.  Governments must not set the goals, (that) will not lead to practical  resolution of the talks."
