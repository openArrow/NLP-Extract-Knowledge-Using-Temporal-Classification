American teenager Michael Fay caned for  vandalising cars has lost weight but is physically well and exercising in his  prison cell, his mother said Tuesday.
"His physical condition seems good. He is exercising up to 300 sit-ups a  day. He looks good, but has lost weight," said Randy Chan after visiting her  son at Queenstown Remand Prison.
Chan was accompanied by her second husband Marco Chan and an unidentified  teenage friend of Fay's.
Randy Chan said that the visit was "a surprise" because Fay, who turned 19  Monday, did not know his friend would show up, adding "so it was a birthday  present he hadn't expected."
Fay was sentenced to six strokes of the rattan cane, four months in jail  and fined for spray painting cars, pelting them with eggs and keeping stolen  road signs and flags.
He was given four lashes earlier this month after the Singapore government  reduced the sentence in response to public appeals by President Bill Clinton  to waive the caning.
Chan said that Fay, from Kettering, Ohio, would leave for the United  States almost immediately after his release from prison on June 21.
