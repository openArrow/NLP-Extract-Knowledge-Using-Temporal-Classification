The grandsons of late French and German leaders  Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer split Sunday during a television  broadcast over the future of the European Union, whose precursor their  forebears had helped consolidate.
During a live question-and-answer session on German television the two men  were asked: "What would your grandfather think today of European construction?"
Charles de Gaulle said his grandfather, the founder of the Fifth French  Republic, would "not have accepted the conception of Europe which stems from  the Maastricht Treaty" on European union.
He told viewers that the late French leader had believed Europe could only  be an association of sovereign states, certainly not a federation comprising  several states.
Konrad Adenauer said his grandfather, West Germany's first federal  chancellor, "would have continued in this direction because he dreamed of  seeing the United States of Europe and that was what he was working for."
Adenauer and de Gaulle were the architects of a Franco-German post-war  reconciliation which was central to the success of the European Economic  Community, forerunner of the European Union.
Adenauer is the ruling Christian Democrats' candidate for municipal  elections to Cologne, the city of which his grandfather was mayor before the  Nazis took power in 1933. He is also a strong supporter of European  integration.
De Gaulle, who belongs to the centre-right Union for French Democracy, in  coalition with the neo-Gaullist RPR, backs a federation of free citizens set  up in Germany by Manfred Brunner, a former official in the European movement  who is opposed to Maastricht.
