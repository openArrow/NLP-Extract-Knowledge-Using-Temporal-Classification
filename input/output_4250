Four armed men took some 30 people hostage on  Thursday in a bus near the southern Russian town of Mineralnoye Vody and  demanded 10 million dollars ransom, a helicopter, arms and drugs, Russian  authorities announced.
The bus was travelling from Vladikavkaz, the capital of the Caucasus  republic of North Ossetia which is part of Russia, to Stavropol, also in  southern Russia.
The Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations said the men were armed with  submachine-guns and a grenade.
They demanded a helicopter -- but one without a crew -- as well as four  more submachine-guns, a grenade-launcher, four flak-jackets, night-sight  scopes, and drugs, the ministry said.
The last hostage drama in Russia was in December, when 15 schoolchildren  were abducted just before Christmas in the southern city of Rostov-on-the-Don.
The four captors obtained a helicopter and led authorities on a four-day  airborne pursuit through the Caucasus before releasing their hostages one by  one in return for 10 million dollars ransom, most of which was recovered.
Mineralnoye Vody is a major hub in the northern Caucasus region for  Russian flights.
