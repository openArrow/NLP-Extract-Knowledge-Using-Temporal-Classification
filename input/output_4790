Right-wing hardliner Ariel Sharon announced  Friday he would run for prime minister in Israel's 1996 elections, provoking  outrage from his party leader Benjamin Netanyahu.
"I intend to submit my candidacy to lead the nationalist camp and save the  state of Israel, Eretz (Greater) Israel and, to a large decree, the Jewish  people," the Likud MP told Israeli radio.
Sharon, defence minister during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon, said the  right-wing opposition should hold primaries to select its candidate for the  contest against the incumbent Labour Party.
Netanyahu, the Likud leader, reacted angrily and called for Sharon to quit  the party.
"Sharon recognizes none of the rules of democracy. He plotted against  Mehachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir (both former Likud premiers) and now he is  plotting against me," he charged.
"It's high time he left the Likud because all he's doing is sowing  division. Plotting is a chronic illness of his."
The 1996 contest will be the first time that the Israeli electorate elects  the prime minister directly, rather than through party lists to elect members  of parliament.
Meanwhile, Israeli television said several Labour deputies had secretly  met with about six Likud colleagues in a villa north of Tel Aviv to try to  draw up a joint platform taking into account the current peace process.
The television filmed the deputies as they met in Kfar Vitkin to try to  arrive at a political programme setting out certain territorial concessions in  the Israeli-occupied West Bank and disputed Golan Heights.
The deputies attended the meeting without the go-ahead from their party  leaders, and refused to comment on the meeting's aims.
Labour deputy Gedalya Gal told the television that it was an "initial  approach and there is still a long way to go to reach an agreement between  Labour and the right."
Raphael Eytan, head of the far-right Tzomet, has also said he would run in  the 1996 elections.
