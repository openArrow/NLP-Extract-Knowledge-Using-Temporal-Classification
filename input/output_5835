President Bill Clinton was Tuesday dubbed the  "nation's first fitness buff" and the "first jogger" in a White House ceremony  he used as a bully pulpit to urge Americans to start exercising.
Vice President Al Gore swore in the President's Council on Physical  Fitness, which helps the administration publicize the need to become  physically fit, but it was the president who scolded the 43 percent of  Americans who he said never worked out.
The lecture doubled as a veiled plea to support his plan to reform the US  health care delivery system.
Clinton said he was willing to tackle health care reform despite  opposition from insurance companies, gun control despite a fight from the  National Rifle Association and smoking despite the enmity of rich tobacco  companies.
"I like fighting these fights, I don't mind making these enemies but  unless the American people do something to seize control of their own personal  health care destiny and that of their families and that of their friends and  neighbors and the kids that live in their cities and communities we are not  going to become what we ought to become," he said, thumping the podium.
The president, by the way, practices what he preaches.
He jogs regularly and has become famous for leaving distinguished guests  in the dust in his regular early morning run.
Tuesday, the victim was 1984 Olympic gold medal winner Al Joyner, husband  of council co-chair Florence Griffith Joyner, a triple Olympics gold medal  winner in track and field.
"Al couldn't keep up and took a motorcade back to the White House," said  Griffith Joyner. "He's (the president) in great shape."
