Japan Airlines Co. Ltd. (JAL) said Wednesday it  would launch a new daily non-stop joint flight with Air France between the new  Kansai International Airport in Osaka and Paris.
The new service, subject to government approval, would be operated three  times a week by Japan Airlines 747-400 aircraft and four times a week by Air  France Airbus A340s, JAL said.
The target date for the beginning of the service is September 4, the  opening day of the new Japanese airport.
Ground service at Kansai International Airport would be provided by JAL  and Air France would take care of ground services at Charles de Gaulle airport  in Paris, it said.
Under a wide-ranging agreement on the operation of the Osaka-Paris direct  route, the two companies also plan mutual maintenance of each other's aircraft  and sharing each other's cargo space, a JAL spokesman said.
It was rare for JAL to join hands with a top European airline on a key  route, the spokesman said, adding that the company aimed at expanding services  while avoiding cost increases with the tie-up.
With high landing costs at the new international airport in Osaka, western  Japan, other foreign airlines may follow Air France in joining hands with  Japanese airlines for operating flights at the new airport, industry observers  said.
