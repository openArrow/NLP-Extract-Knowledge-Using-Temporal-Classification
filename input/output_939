New Zealander Robert Hall has reached the summit  of Mount Lhotse, the Nepalese Tourism Ministry announced Monday.
Hall, accompanied by Edmond Viesturs, from the United States, reached the  top of the 8,516 metre (27,938 foot) mountain earlier Monday after a nine and  a half hour climb using the technically difficult and dangerous west face  route, it said.
Both men had only recently scaled Mount Everest as part of the  eight-member Mount Everest Clean Up Expedition, before joining the Swedish  expedition on Lhotse.
Hall is the only foreigner to have climbed the 8,848 metre (29,028 foot)  high Everest four times.
