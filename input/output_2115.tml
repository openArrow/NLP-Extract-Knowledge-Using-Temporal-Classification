In the club-car which <EVENT eid="e6" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">carried</EVENT> the drivers towards France at 130 kilometres  (80 miles) an hour, Mal Lindsey, a British driver <EVENT eid="e7" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESPART" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">working</EVENT> for the Bird's  company, <EVENT eid="e8" class="REPORTING" tense="PAST" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">said</EVENT> laconically:&#13;
"The freight shuttle is better and quicker than the ferry. On the ferry,  after breakfast, it's boring, you have nothing to do. Here, in the club-car,  just the time to <EVENT eid="e9" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">eat</EVENT>, and you have already <EVENT eid="e10" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="PRESENT" aspect="PERFECTIVE" polarity="POS" modality="none">arrived</EVENT>."&#13;

"You have the impression of being in the metro (Paris underground  railway). And what's more, it's just as hot."&#13;
"On the whole it's positive, it's fast, particularly as you're able to  <EVENT eid="e21" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">forget</EVENT> about the lorry, to <EVENT eid="e22" class="OCCURRENCE" tense="INFINITIVE" aspect="NONE" polarity="POS" modality="none">relax</EVENT>.
