FIFA General Secretary Sepp Blatter urged  Japan on Friday to ease tough anti-drug immigration rules and grant  Argentinian soccer captain Diego Maradona a visa, describing the convicted  drug-user as "a victim not a culprit."
Maradona and his Argentinian teammates are set to pull out of the Kirin  Cup tournament after Tokyo stuck by it's stringent policy of denying visas to  individuals like Maradona convicted of narcotics offences.
"It is my personal opinion that it is unfair for a government to continue  to punish any person who has been convicted of such an offence but has served  his punishment," said Blatter, who is visiting the Asian Football  Confederation Congress being held in Malaysia.
Maradona was arrested in Buenos Aires in April 1991 for concaine  possession and five months later was given a 14 month suspended sentence by an  Italian court on the same charge.
Blatter said neither Japanese nor Argentinian soccer officials had raised  the controversy with him and the first he heard of it was when a journalist  raised the issue at a press conference.
"It does not directly involve FIFA because it is a friendly tournament  afterall. If they contacted us we would simply offer them this advice," said  Blatter.
Blatter also pleaded for a little understanding of Maradona's  cirumstances, which he said made him more likely to be arrested than anybody  else.
"I ask you this, if he were not a footballer would there have been a  problem because he most likely would not have been caught? "said Blatter.
Meanwhile Blatter told a press conference it was likely that FIFA's  executive committee meeting next Friday would agree to raise the World Cup  format to 32 teams in time for the 1998 competition, an increase of eight  sides.
But Blatter said the extra places would be shared between the regional  confederations and would be decided "after knowing the results of the  performances of the regions in the 1994 World Cup."
