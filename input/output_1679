Denmark will support a bill that calls for the  creation of a whale sanctuary in the Antarctic when the International Whaling  Commission (IWC) meets next week in Mexico, Foreign Minister Niels Helveg  Petersen said Wednesday.
Petersen told reporters following a meeting of parliament's environmental  commission that "Denmark will support the French proposal aimed at creating a  reserve to protect whales in the Antarctic."
The IWC meeting in Mexico will be held May 23-30.
The Danish government abstained from voting on the matter in May 1993  because of opposition from Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory in the  Arctic, where whale hunting is a tradition and a means of subsistence.
"The Greenlanders adopted a more comprehensive attitude this time which  allowed us to support the French project," Petersen said.
Danish environmental organisations and international groups such as  Greenpeace have also been applying pressure on the government.
Petersen added that he would try during the IWC meeting to inrease the  annual quota alloted to Greenland for hunting whales.
