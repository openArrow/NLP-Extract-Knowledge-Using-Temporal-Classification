Remains of what could be the oldest man in Europe  -- believed to date back half a million years -- have been unearthed in  southern England, the Times reported Tuesday.
If accurate, the dating of the fragment of a human limb found during a dig  at an Old Stone Age site in Boxgrove, west Sussex, would make it some 100,000  years older than any other European human remains and one of the most  important archaeological finds for decades.
Although the Boxgrove bone is millions of years later than the earliest  humanoids, known as Australopithecus, who lived up to 3.75 million years ago,  previous finds of human remains in Britain date from around a quarter of a  million years ago -- comparable in age with those found in France, Germany and  Greece.
A spokesman for English Heritage said full details of the find would be  made public towards the end of the month.
