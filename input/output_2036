A series of napalm reservoirs exploded, totally  destroying an underground arms depot west of the Kyrgyzstan capital, Bishkek,  the Kyrgyz defence ministry, quoted by ITAR-TASS agency, said Thursday.
A ministry spokesman said the blasts, which caused no injuries, took place  "following an act of negligence." Napalm is used to produce incendiary bombs.
Negligence has also been blamed for a devastating blast at an arms depot  in the Russian Far East last Saturday which destroyed 1,600 tonnes of weapons.  Two conscripts have been arrested on suspicion of causing the blast.
One of the two is suspected of having dismantled a missile and withdrawing  a part, causing a short-circuit which set off a fire.
