Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) have completed their inspection of a North Korean nuclear  experimental reprocessing facility after taking samples, IAEA officials said  in Vienna Wednesday.
The samples should allow the IAEA to determine whether plutonium could  have been manufactured or diverted to the Yongbyon laboratory, located 90  kilometres (55 miles) north of the North Korean capital Pyongyang, possibly  for use in making nuclear bombs.
Plutonium is a key element for making nuclear bombs.
Earlier Wednesday IAEA spokesman Hans-Friedrich Meyer announced that one  inspector who was part of a three-man team that arrived in North Korea last  week to carry out the inspection had left the country.
The other two inspectors were holding talks Wednesday with officials in  Pyongyong along with two special IAEA envoys who arrived in the North Korean  capital Tuesday.
The talks, which were expected to continue through Thursday, were focusing  on measurements of fuel rods at an experimental nuclear reactor, also at  Yongbyon.
The United States suspects North Korea of diverting some of its nuclear  fuel for military purposes, a charge denied by the government in Pyongyang.
