The UN World Food Programme (WFP) has launched an  operation to feed some 150,000 people displaced by tribal violence in northern  Ghana, it said in a statement received here Tuesday.
In the next five months, the WFP plans to distribute more than 11,000  tonnes of cereals, vegetables and salt, the statement said.
Since February, clashes among four ethnic groups have claimed more than  1,000 lives, according to official figures, and 300 villages have been razed  to the ground.
"Significant amounts of food stocks were also destroyed during the  fighting, resulting in local food shortages and the doubling of local food  prices," the WFP statement said.
"About 70 percent of the internally displaced people, located in eight  northern districts, are women and children. A large number of them have been  integrated in local families or with friends. But the food situation of host  communities is deteriorating," it warned.
"Since the north is the country's major producer of staple food crops,  such as yam, the overall food supply situation may worsen further in the year  if the displaced population is unable to return to their villages before the  beginning of the planting season," it added.
Last week, the Ghanaian parliament extended for one month a strate of  emergency declared in the region on February 10. Since the beginning of May,  12 "attacks" have been officially registered. The violence has pitted the  Konkomba tribe against three other ethnic groups, the Dagombas, Nanumbas and  Gonjas, who are the traditional landowners and holders of power in the north.
