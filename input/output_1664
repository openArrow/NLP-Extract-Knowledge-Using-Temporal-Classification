Former England captain Bryan Robson  signed a three-year contract, believed to be worth a million pounds, on  Wednesday as player-manager of English First Division side Middlesbrough
Robson, who had 13 years at Manchester United during which he won three FA  Cups, the European Cup Winners Cup and most recently, two championships, was  given a rousing welcome by fans when he arrived at his new club's Ayresome  Park.
The 37-year-old star told them: "I don't want to promise too much at the  start but let's hope that somewhere along the line, Middlesbrough can come  back to the Premier League, where they deserve to be."
Robson, who is part-time assistant to England coach Terry Venables, was  Boro's number one target to replace Lennie Lawrence, who was sacked after the  team missed out on the First Division play-offs.
He will play for at least a season for Boro, due to move to a new 16  million pound, 32,000 all-seater stadium next year, before concentrating on  his coaching and managerial duties.
Robson stressed there would be no clear-out of the Boro playing staff and  said he wanted to give everyone a chance to prove themselves.
The new boss, who had the heartbreak of being left out of United's  victorious FA Cup Final squad on Saturday, said: "I still want to play and I  think it would be easier to play in the First Division to the standards I have  set myself.
"After the double at Manchester United I did not feel it right to go to  another Premier League club as a player.
"I have every opportunity to be a success as a manager. The board are  backing me 100 per cent and that's why I am here today."
Robson's former Old Trafford and England team-mate, Viv Anderson, now  managing First Division Barnsley, is widely tipped to become assistant manager  at Ayresome Park.
