Taiwan's first quarter economic growth stood at 5.5  percent, lower than the previously forecast 5.9 percent, on a narrowed trade  surplus and a decline in domestic investment, economic officials said Thursday.
Citing preliminary statistics by the Direcorate General of Budget,  Accounting and Statistics, the officials said the disappointing economic  performance in the January-March period will force a downward adjustment of  growth estimates for 1994 to below six percent from a forecast 6.2 percent.
Taiwan's trade surplus plummeted 82 percent from a year earlier to 240  million US dollars in the three months to March, the lowest quarterly level in  13 years, they said.
Stagnant demand from overseas countries hit the export-oriented island's  manufacturing sector hardest, they said, adding that domestic investment in  Taiwan's manufacturing industry shrank in the preiod.
A total of 1,413 new companies were launched in Taiwan during the quarter,  with an aggregate registered capital of 18.6 billion Taiwan dollars (705  million US), a 26.8 percent slide over the same period last year, they noted.
Expansion of existing plants also dropped, reducing total investment in  domestic manufacturing for the January-March period to 76 billion Taiwan  dollars, a 60.3-percent plunge, they added.
Taiwan has already scaled down its 1991-1996 national development package  by 2.7 trillion dollars to 5.5 trillion dollars due to funding problems.
Under the massive national development package with 479 infrastructure  projects, the island could enjoy seven-percent growth over the next few years.
The export-oriented island's gross national product (GNP) this year was  set at 239.5 billion US dollars, compared with 220.2 billion US dollars last  year, and per capita GNP will increase to 11,383 US dollars for 1994 from  1993's 10,566 US dollars.
Inflation as measured by the consumer price index was expected to be 3.6  percent for this year.
