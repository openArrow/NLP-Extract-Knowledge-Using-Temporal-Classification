Faced with few options on storage for  weapons-grade plutonium, US authorities are studying the possibility of using  military bases to be closed as interim storage sites, officials said Thursday.
Energy undersecretary Charles Curtis told a Senate panel the use of  military bases was one of a range of options for storing plutonium from  dismantled warheads over the next 10 to 20 years.
The government may have as much as 100 tonnes of plutonium, and storage is  a controversial matter because of environmental concerns. The Department of  Energy had earlier ruled out the use of military bases, but has now begun to  reconsider such a plan.
The most immediate problem is finding a site for plutonium at the Pantex  weapons plant in Texas. Energy Department officials have said they hope to  keep material at the plant for five to 10 years, but may look at other options.
Wolfgang Panofsky of Stanford University, who headed a study by the  National Academy of Sciences on the matter, said plutonium storage can be safe  if precautions are taken, adding that the greatest danger is if the material  falls into the wrong hands. About 10 pounds are needed to make a bomb.
For security reasons, US officials are declining to disclose exact sites  being considered for storage.
