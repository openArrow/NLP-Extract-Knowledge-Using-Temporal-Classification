US-Japan talks aimed at breaking a three-month  deadlock in trade negotiations are going well and will be extended into a  third day Saturday, a senior US official said Friday.
"The conversations are going well," President Bill Clinton's deputy  economic advisor said as he emerged from an almost three-hour session, the  third since Thursday morning.
He said he did not think the two sides would meet again Friday.
"We'll meet again tomorrow in the morning," he said.
The talks had originally been scheduled to last only one day.
The two sides are trying to reach agreement on ways to open Japan's  markets and reduce its 60 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States.
