Eight gold bars worth about 10 million yen (96,000  dollars) have been found at a garbage collection point under a crowded railway  overpass in Tokyo, but three months after the discovery, nobody has shown up  claiming he was the owner, police said Wednesday.
Along with the gold bars, found by local residents, were six gold and  silver coins from the United States, Mexico and France.
The owner of lost property has six months and 14 days to come forward  after its recovery has been reported to the police.
