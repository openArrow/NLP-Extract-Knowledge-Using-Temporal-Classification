Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Sunday dismissed  his prime minister, Ahmad Hussein al-Khodair, and took his place at the head  of a new government, the official Iraqi news agency INA said.
It said the decision was taken "because of the exceptional economic  situation" and announced in a presidential decree following a meeting of the  Revolutionary Command Council, Iraq's top decision-making body.
Saddam named three deputy prime ministers, Tareq Aziz who stays in the  post, Taha Yassin Ramadan and Mohammad Hamzeh al-Zubaydi.
Several key ministers kept their posts: Mohammad Said al-Sahaf at the  foreign ministry, General Ali Hassan al-Majid at defence, Watban Ibrahim  al-Hassan at interior, and Safa Hedi Jawad at the oil ministry.
Khodair also stays on as finance minister, his second post in the  dismissed government, which was formed on September 5.
Iraq has faced a crippling UN economic embargo since its invasion of  Kuwait in August 1990. It has stepped up a diplomatic drive to have the  sanctions lifted, saying the United States was the only major obstacle.
