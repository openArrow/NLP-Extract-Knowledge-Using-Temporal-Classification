An Israeli commando aboard two helicopters  abducted overnight a military leader of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah movement  from the Bekaa region of eastern Lebanon, an Israeli army spokesman said  Saturday.
He said the commando seized Mustafa Dirani at 02:00 a.m. (Friday 23:00  GMT) from a village in the eastern part of the Bekaa valley between Zahle and  Baalbeck.
The spokesman said Dirani was leader of a small group called the  "Resistance of the Faithful" which in October 1986 captured Israeli airman Ron  Arad.
Arad was taken prisoner when his plane was shot down over Sidon.  He is  the only Israeli prisoner of war in Lebanon still presumed to be alive.
In 1989, the Israeli army kidnapped Sheikh Obeid, another Hezbollah leader  with a view to exchanging him for Arad.  Obeid has been detained by the  Israeli authorities ever since.
