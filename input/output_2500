Ukrainian lawmakers suspended the constitution of  independance-leaning Crimea, parliamentary sources said, after Crimean  deputies earlier adopted a basic law which amounted to a declaration of  independence from Kiev.
In the closed-session vote Ukrainian deputies gave the pro-Russian Crimean  assembly 10 days to "conform with the laws and constitution of Ukraine."
