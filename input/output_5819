Chilean army chief and former dictator General  Augusto Pinochet on Tuesday discussed arms deals in the Czech capital, where  his presence triggered a series of protests, CTK agency said.
Pinochet flew into Prague Monday from Amsterdam for a private visit of  several days at the invitation of Omnipol, an arms specialists.
Pinochet and a Chilean military delegation held talks with Omnipol and on  Wednesday are to visit an arms fair at Brno in the south, CTK said.
The Czech Interior Minister Jan Ruml told Czech television Tuesday that  Pinochet should not have been given a visa to come to Prague but that now that  he had it, it would not be withdrawn.
Monday evening, a dinner organised by Ominpol for the Chilean delegation  was cancelled at the last minute after the owner of the Troja Castle outside  Prague refused Pinochet's party entry "for political reasons", CTK said.
The Czech and Moravian union congress also joined the protests against him.
"A man who by all evidence is responsable for the death and torture of  thousands of patriotic and democratic Chileans should not be allowed to be a  negotiating partner," the group said.
Pinochet ruled Chile after a military coup in 1973 until he was voted out  in 1988.
