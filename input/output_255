The Irish central bank on Friday lowered its key  directive short-term interest rate from 6.5, to 6.25 percent, effective next  Monday.
The previous cut, from 6.75 to 6.5 percent, came on April 15.
The move came two days after the German Bundesbank reduced its discount  and Lombard rates and was followed by a number of other European countries.
The short-term rate is the one most used by the Bank of Ireland in lending  to the banking system.
