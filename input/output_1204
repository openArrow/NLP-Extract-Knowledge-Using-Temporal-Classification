A man who killed three teenagers in  1990 and showed no remorse at his trial was executed by lethal injection early  Tuesday after refusing to file any appeals.
John Frederick Thanos, 45, said, "Adios," before he was administered the  lethal dose becoming Maryland's first inmate to be executed since 1961 and the  240th nationwide since the US Supreme Court allowed states to use the death  penalty.
"Here it comes now," Thanos uttered as he felt the toxic chemicals enter  his bloodstream, witnesses said.
Thanos had been mistakenly released 18 months early from prison, where he  had been sent for robbery, Thanos killed an 18-year-old hitchhiker and, a week  later, two other boys, 16 and 14, during a gas station holdup.
During his trial, Thanos refused to recognize the court's authority and  told the judge that if his two younger victims could be brought back to life  he would slay them again.
"I did it, I was sentenced, I accept that," Thanos said at a May 6 hearing  during which his mother and sister tried to prove he was mentally incompetent  to be executed.
