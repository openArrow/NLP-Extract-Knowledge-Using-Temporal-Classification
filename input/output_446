Riot police Saturday stopped 400 South Korean  students from attacking the homes of two former generals-turned presidents  facing action for alleged involvement in the military supression of a 1980  civil uprising.
Scuffles lasted half an hour in heavy rain after hundreds of riot police,  armed with tear gas, stopped the students some 200 meters from the homes of  Chun Doo-Hwan and Roh Tae-Woo, who live in the same area.
"Punish the main culprits of the Kwangju massacre," shouted students  trying to push their way through columns of police. Many carried iron pipes  but did not use them.
The demonstration came on day after dissidents filed a civil petition   urging prosecutors to investigate the two former presidents on charges of  insurrection and homicide.
In addition to the petition, veterans of the uprising have filed a suit   against the two, and 33 former military officers on the same charges, accusing  them of killing many innocent citizens in a bid to seize power.
The two former presidents led generals in the military-controlled  government in 1980. Chun became the nation's president the year following the  uprising in the southern city of Kwangju, and Roh succeeded him in 1988.
