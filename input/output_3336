The dollar edged lower Monday against the other  major currencies with the exception of the yen in quiet trading in New York.
The price of gold meanwhile rose 3.70 dollars from Friday's close to  389.60 dollars per ounce.
At 5:10 p.m. (2110 GMT), the dollar was trading at 1.6430 German marks  against 1.6465 German marks late Friday and at 104.35 yen from 104.11.
The dollar recouped some of its losses in late trading but remained lower  against the other European currencies at 5.6235 French francs from 5.6305,  1.4040 Swiss francs against 1.4055 and 0.6636 pounds sterling from 0.6640.
Trading was generally quiet, reflecting the Pentecost holiday being  observed in many European markets and the lack of new data on the US economy.
