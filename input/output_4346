The dollar strengthened against other major  currencies here Thursday in a calm market dominated by technical factors.
Gold, meanwhile, fell to 384.80 dollars an ounce, down 1.80 dollar from  late Wednesday.
At about 1:00 p.m. (1700 GMT), the dollar traded at 1.6468 German marks,  up from 1.6430 in the morning and from 1.6445 late Wednesday.
Against the yen, it was quoted at 104.65, up from 104.35 yen in early  trading and 104.37 Wednesday.
The dollar rose to 5.6290 French francs from 5.6270 late Wednesday, to  1.4060 Swiss francs (1.4030) and to 0.6629 pound sterling (0.6625).
The dollar momentarily fell below the 1.64-mark level then rebounded in  limited trading due to the absence of any trend, said a trader with a large  European bank in New York.
Traders were awaiting the publication Friday of the government's first  revision of its first-quarter estimate of gross domestic product. Experts  believe the economy grew 2.4 percent, slightly lower than the initial estimate  of a 2.6 percent expansion.
They also were reluctant to enter the market ahead of the long US Memorial  Day holiday weekend.
