Two polls published this weekend by the same  newspaper show voters in the predominantly French-speaking province of Quebec  will elect a government dedicated to Quebec independence but will then reject  independence.
Le Soleil reported Saturday that 33 percent of decided voters will vote  for the separatist Parti Quebecois (PQ), compared to 29 percent for the  governing provincial Liberal Party which is committed to keeping Quebec within  Canada.
But on Sunday, the same newspaper reported that 52 percent of the  electorate is opposed to independence from Canada with just 35 percent wanting  a sovereign state of Quebec.
Among the province's majority francophones, 44 percent are opposed to  independence compared to 42 percent in favor.
Quebec must have a general election by November and PQ leader Jacques  Parizeau has promised that, if elected, he will hold a referendum within a  year on the independence issue.
