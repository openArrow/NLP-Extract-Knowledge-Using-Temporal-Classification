The Security Council urged North Korea  Monday to allow full international inspection of its nuclear facilities but  stopped short of threatening sanctions against Pyongyang.
In a consensus statement read by Ibrahim Gambari of Nigeria, the council's  current chairman, the 15-member council called for immediate consultations  between the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and North Korea about  Pyongyang's refuelling of the Yongbyon nuclear reactor.
The council said it was "gravely concerned" by the IAEA's assessment that  if the refuelling continues at the same pace without immediate inspections,  experts will not be able to determine whether the plutonium has been diverted  for nuclear weapons production.
The United States suspects North Korea of using its nuclear program to  produce weapons while North Korea maintains its program has only peaceful ends.
