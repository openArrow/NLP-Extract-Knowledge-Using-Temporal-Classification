Fighting between Abkhazian and Georgian forces late  Thursday killed one Abkhazian soldier and injured two, the Abkhazian defence  ministry said Friday.
Skirmishes broke out around the hydro-electric power plant on the Ingouri  river, marking the border between Abkhazia and Georgia, after around 60  Georgians crossed into Abkhazian territory, said the ministry, cited by  ITAR-TASS news-agency.
All Abkhazian forces had been put on alert Friday, the same source said.
Abkhazian Defence Minister Sultan Sosnaliev told Interfax news-agency the  "authors of the confrontation" were attempting to violate the accord signed  last week in Moscow to end the Abkhazian conflict.
On May 14 both sides agreed a ceasefire and the deployment of a  peacekeeping force from the Commonwealth of Independent States in a security  zone the length of the Ingouri river.
Abkhazian separatists declared the northwestern Georgian region  independent in July 1992, sparking an assault by government forces sent by  Tbilisi.
However, after 13 months of fighting which left more than 3,000 people  dead, the separatists routed Georgian troops and chased them from the regional  capital Sukhumi.
An estimated 250,000 Georgian civilians fled the embattled region after  the fall of Sukhumi.
