South Africa does not want handouts, but rather a  level playing field where it can compete with full access to international  markets, vice president Frederik de Klerk said here Thursday.
He said he had emphasized, in talks with Prime Minister John Major and  other officials, that "South Africa is very grateful for aid, but we are not  looking for handouts, that we would like, on the basis of being competitive,  to have full access to all markets.
"If we look at the future," he told a press conference, "then we are  looking at expanding our exports on the one hand and on the other hand  attracting new investment.
"We intend to create an investor-friendly climate to make it attractive  and profitable to invest in our country."
De Klerk is serving as one of two deputy presidents under Nelson Mandela  following the African National Congress victory in South Africa's historic  all-race elections last month.
De Klerk played a key role in dismantling apartheid as president of South  Africa.
In talks with officials here, de Klerk said, he had conveyed "assurances  that the government of national unity has started off on the right foot, that  there is good cooperation between the participants."
He skirted the question of the cost of South Africa's reconstruction  program, now estimated at twice what President Nelson Mandela's African  National Congress had quoted during the election campaign.
"I don't think we should focus too much on what it will cost," he said. "I  think the main focus should be on what we can afford, without harming the  economy, without running up inflation again. That should be the test."
He said the reconstruction and development program, "as it was announced  in the election it was ANC policy.
"The ANC has won the election, but we serve in a government of national  unity and we need to refine that proposal so that it can become a plan of the  government. That process is taking place at this point in time."
