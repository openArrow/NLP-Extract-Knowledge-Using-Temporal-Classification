Malawi's new president, Bakili Muluzi, was  expected to announce his new cabinet Tuesday afternoon, informed sources said.
Muluzi has delayed naming his cabinet as he negotiated with the Alliance  For Democracy (AFORD), with whom his ruling United Democratic Front (UDF)  Party  want to form a government of national unity.
With 84 seats won in last week's first free poll, which ended the 30-year  reign of president Kamuzu Banda, the UDF fell five short of a 51 percent  absolute majority in parliament.
AFORD had 36 seats while the former ruling Malawi Congress Party won 55  seats.
Technically the UDF can form a minority government, but Muluzi wants to  involve AFORD which swept all 33 seats in the north of the southern African  nation, the party's stronghold.
Expected to be included in the cabinet are AFORD leader Chafukwa Chihana,  who spearheaded a campaign for democracy two years ago, and one of his top  lieutenants, Mapopa Chipeta.
