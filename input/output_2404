The French government has not taken a  decision regarding the eventual partial privatisation of the Renault car  manufacturer but favours French investors, French Industry Minister Gerard  Longuet said here on Friday.
He said: "No decision has been taken".
He said there had been no change in the way the matter was being regarded  during the last few days. The daily business newspaper La Tribune had reported  on Friday that the government planned to privatise 15-25 percent of Renault  this autumn.
"If the agreement between Volvo and Renault had been approved by the  Swedes, we would have launched the privatisation quickly because there would  have been an industrial project, but all that is past history.
"The Swedes pulled out and now there is a place vacant and we would prefer  that French and private shareholders take it."
Referring to questions about a so-called "Latin base" between Renault and  Fiat of Italy, he said: "It is attractive intellectualy. The problem is that  Volvo and Renault were highly complementary but Fiat and Renault are very  comparable. Is it better to marry someone who resembles you or someone who  complements you?"
Renault and Volvo had had a long association until the end of last year  when Swedish shareholders rebelled against a proposed merger because they saw  the deal as a takeover by Renault and they had doubts about the announced  timetable for the privatisation of the French group.
Since then the two companies have begun to disentangle their joint  interests.
