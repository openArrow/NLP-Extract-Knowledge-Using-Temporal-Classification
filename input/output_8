Ernie Els was back to his best when the Spanish  Open began at windy Club de Camp here Thursday.
The South African, who makes a habit of false starts, had seven birdies in  his five-under-par 67 to take the lead from Zimbabwe's Mark McNulty and  England's Steven Richardson and Peter Mitchell.
Els rocketed to his first European Tour victory back in January when he  beat world number one Greg Norman by six strokes in the Desert Classic in  Dubai.
But he missed the halfway cut at St Mellion in England last week when he  returned following a two-week break.
"I was a bit rusty but I didn't want to miss the elections back home,"  said the 24-year-old from Johannesburg.
McNulty had five birdies on greens that became very fast in the wind and  sun. "They were just my pace. I liked them very much," he said.
He was playing only his third event on the European Tour this season after  injuring his shoulder playing beach cricket with his children.
Seve Ballesteros was well satisfied with his first round 72 despite being  five shots behind Els.
Last week Ballesteros had 16 pars and two birdies in his final round at  the Benson and Hedges Open at St Mellion for his first tournament success for  more than two years.
Today he parred the first 11 holes and his only two bogeys came when he  missed a three-foot putt at the 13th and a six-footer at the 14th.
"I have been very steady and I should have had a much better score because  I missed five birdie chances in the first nine holes," he said.
Richardson, who has missed the cut in six of his last seven tournaments,  hit his best form of the year when he covered his first nine holes in a  six-under-par 30. But he couldn't keep it up, coming home in 38.
