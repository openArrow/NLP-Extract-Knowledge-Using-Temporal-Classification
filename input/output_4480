Japan on Friday welcomed President Bill Clinton's  decision to renew China's preferential trading status.
"Japan welcomes the latest decision, as it believes US-China relations are  very important to the Asia-Pacific region," said government spokesman Horoshi  Kumagai.
Kumagai added that Washington had briefed Tokyo on the decision before the  announcement was made on Thursday.
Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa also expressed support for Clinton's  decision, adding Japan would continue to urge China to improve its record on  human rights.
Clinton had linked renewal of China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) trading  status with "significant progress" in human rights.
On Thursday he admitted that "serious human rights abuses continue" in  China.
But he renewed MFN status and delinked it from human rights, saying the  policy had reached "the end of (its) usefulness."
