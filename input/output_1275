Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe arrived in a cold,  rainy and blustery London Tuesday to begin a four-day state visit at the  invitation of Queen Elizabeth II.
He was greeted by Princess Margaret on his arrival at Heathrow Airport  from Frankfurt, and made no public statement before being driven off in a  chauffered Rolls Royce limosine with a 15-motorcycle police escort.
