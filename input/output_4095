The police card kept coming up when  fortune teller Janine Costa read her own personal fortune with the tarot pack.
Then she found out why -- a policeman posing as a client Monday paid her  15 dollars (10 US) to read the cards for him at Ipswich near here in a  tarot-card sting.
As a result the 38-year-old faced possible charges of witchery and sorcery  under a Queensland state law based on an English Vagrancy Act of 1824.
It says that anyone who "pretends to exercise or use any kind of  witchcraft, sorcery, enchantment or conjuration or undertakes to tell  fortunes" can be given a year's hard labour.
"I suppose I should have been warned because in my personal card readings  for the past few weeks a government or police card has been coming up," said  Costa.
Police were set to lay charges before police assistant commissioner Ron  McGibbon stepped in, ruling that they would not proceed "in this instance  because we regard it as entertainment."
And a spokesman for state attorney-general Dean Wells said the vagrants  act was likely to be dropped as the government deleted outmoded laws.
"But I wasn't worried. I'd already read the outcome in the cards," Costa  said.
