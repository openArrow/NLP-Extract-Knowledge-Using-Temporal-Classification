Israel decided Sunday to allow another 13,000  Palestinian to enter the country to work, raising the total number of workers  from the Gaza Strip and West Bank to 25,500, the labour ministry said.
The ministry's spokesman Hanan Robin said the 13,000 construction workers  would have to be over the age of 25, married, and have already worked in  Israel for at least five years, for security reasons.
Since the army sealed off the occupied territories on April 7, following a  bus bombing which left eight Israelis dead, the closure has been progessively  eased.
Besides the 25,500 permits, Israel has allowed 16,000 Palestinians to  return to work in annexed East Jerusalem. Most are hospital, aid or embassy  workers, business people and military administration employees.
Before the February 25 massacre in the West Bank town of Hebron when a  Jewish settler shot dead 30 Moslem worshippers, 50,000 Palestinians from the  territories were employed in Israel.
Israel has decided to import 18,000 foreign labourers, mainly from Romania  and Thailand, to replace cheap Palestinian labour.
