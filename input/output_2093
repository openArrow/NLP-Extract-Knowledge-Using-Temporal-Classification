Britain and Spain Thursday joined France Thursday  in warning they might pull their troops out of Bosnia unless serious all-party  peace talks took place, saying UN soldiers could not stay there forever.
British Foreign Office Minister of State Douglas Hogg warned here that  "time is running out" for a negotiated solution to the crisis, while in Madrid  Defence Minister Julian Garcia Vargas said Spain would probably consider  reducing its troop contingent in the coming months.
On Wednesday, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe had said his country  could not leave its peacekeepers "indefinitely" in Bosnia.
Together, the three countries make up around 35 percent of the UN  Protection Force's (UNPROFOR) 33,000 troops stationed in former Yugoslavia,  according to official United Nations figures issued earlier this month.
Hogg told a private group Wednesday night in remarks reported Thursday  that the Bosnian Moslems "have to recognize military defeat when it stares  them in the face...
"They have got to accept...that the military option has to be  abandoned...that land had been seized by force and there is going to have to  be a degree of acquiescence in that.
"Time is running out," he said. "We have eight weeks or so" to see  positive developments in the peace process.
But Prime Minister John Major said Thursday in the House of Commons: "We  have no intention at the moment of removing our troops."
And a Foreign Office spokesman stressed that Hogg was not referring to a  withdrawal of troops within any set time limit.
A government source played down the Hogg's comments as rather "robust,"  suggesting that the minister had voiced publicly a line of argument that the  Foreign Office would have preferred to have remained unstated.
Garcia Vargas meanwhile said that it was "probable in the coming months we  may consider reducing our troops in Bosnia ... The UN peacekeepers cannot stay  on a mission forever."
