Bergkamp has had a mixed first season in Italy with Inter Milan but in the  orange national shirt he enhanced his international reputation with the  crucial goals that ended England's interest in the competition.
In Brian Roy of Foggia and Ajax's Marc Overmars, Advocaat can call on a  pair of lively young wingers capable of destroying any defence in the world.  Lazio's Aron Winter and Inter Milan's Wim Jonk are likely starters in midfield.
To add to this formidable array of attacking options, Advocaat can also  count on the shooting power of Barcelona's Ronald Koeman -- the sweeper whose  long range strikes made him the top scorer in this year's European Cup.
But while Holland are a match for anybody going forward, they look  vulnerable defensively. Koeman and the gnarled veteran Jan Wouters have a  wealth of experience but the Dutch back four looking vulnerable to pace.
Advocaat, dubbed Napoleon because of his remarkable resemblence to the  little general, might be forced to deploy Rijkaard in the back four rather  than in the midfield role he prefers.
If the defence does prove shaky, Advocaat can at least count on one of the  safest pairs of hands in international football in Hans Van Breukelen.
The PSV Eindhoven keeper will be nearly 38 by the time the finals come  round but he is playing as well as ever and is determined to move into  management with a World Cup winners medal in his trophy cabinet.
