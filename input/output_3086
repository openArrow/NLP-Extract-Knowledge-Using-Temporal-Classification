North Korea indicated Monday it was willing to  rejoin the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and widen access to nuclear  sites, if the United States abandons its "hostile" approach toward Pyongyang.
The Workers' Daily, quoted by the official news agency KCNA received here,  rounded on Washington, accusing it of triggering the crisis on the Korean  peninsula by refusing to hold a new round of talks with the North.
"If the United States had renounced such a policy, and the third round of  the (North Korean)-US talks had been held for a package solution... (North  Korea) would be been freed from its special status and routine and ad-hoc  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) made," it said.
"And such outstanding matters as the preservation of selected fuel rods  and sampling by the IAEA would have been solved automatically," it said.
North Korea threatened to completely withdraw from the NPT 13 months ago,  in a move that placed it under close international scrutiny. It "suspended"  the threat several months later when Washington agreed to high-level talks.
Since then, North Korea has been playing, according to western critics, a  game of cat-and-mouse over its controversial nuclear programme.
It has repeatedly that it is building a nuclear bomb, but also refused to  throw open facilities to IAEA monitors. That stance caused the United States  to interrupt dialogue with the isolated Stalinist state last autumn.
In the latest development, North Korean engineers have begun withdrawing  fuel rods from a complex at Yongbyon, 90 kilometers (55 miles) north of  Pyongyang, an operation triggering fears that it was diverting fuel to  military ends.
On Friday, US Defence Secretary William Perry said North Korea had not  diverted any nuclear fuel since the rod operation had begun.
