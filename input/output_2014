Ukraine launched consultations Thursday with US,  Russian and Crimean officials on a controversial plan to impose presidential  rule in Crimea, an aide to Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said.
The official, who asked not to be named, said that talks were launched  after at least 1,000 special interior ministry troops and members of the  national guard arrived in Crimea to place local law-enforcement forces under  their control.
The troops were sent as the Crimean parliament convened to vote on  reinstating a 1992 constitutional provision stipulating that relations between  central authorities in Ukraine and Crimea were to be governed by treaties.
The decision was viewed by Kiev as tantamount to a declaration of  independence.
The presidential aide said that the outcome of the Ukrainian plan to quash  the Crimea's drive for reunification with Russia would "depend on the  consultations currently under way between Russia, Ukraine, Crimea and the  United States."
In his telephone conversation with Russian President Boris Yeltsin,  Kravchuk said that "Ukraine would take measures that are in line with the  constitution and to maintain its territorial integrity," said Ukrainian  presidential spokesman Viktor Stelmakh.
Crimea was part of Russia up until former Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev  handed over the territory to Ukraine in 1954 as a "gift" celebrating the  friendship between the two Slav peoples.
An overwhelming majority of voters in the mostly Russian-populated  peninsula have said in an unofficial referendum that they favor close ties  with Russia and elected Russian nationalists to the local legislature during  parliamentary elections last March.
