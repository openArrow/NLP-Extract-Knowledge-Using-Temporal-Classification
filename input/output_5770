The index of American consumer confidence in the  US economy slipped to 87.6 percent in May from a revised 92.1 percent the  previous month, the Conference Board said Tuesday.
The Conference Board, a private business research institute, had initially  estimated the April level at 91.7 percent.
The decline in May was sharper than expected. Most analysts had forecast a  dip to 90.5 percent.
