PLO leader Yasser Arafat has called on  members of the Palestinian administration to run Jericho and Gaza to draw up a  100-day emergency plan, a member of the team said Tuesday.
Saeb Erekat told AFP that Arafat had called upon each "minister" to draw  up a separate plan for their own porfolio, as well as to move to the self-rule  enclave of Jericho as soon as possible.
The PLO chief, who is to head the authority, is himself expected to visit  here in mid-June.
Twenty of the 24-member team have so far been named, 18 of whom have  confirmed their participation, and 15 portfolios designated, not including the  interior which Arafat is to take.
Erekat said the authority would rent a plot of land belonging to the  Moslem religious authorities to construct a building where all the  "ministries" are to be housed, with financial aid from Spain.
When Palestinian self-rule is extended to areas of the West Bank still  under Israeli occupation, the authority will move its headquarters to  Ramallah, a much larger town near Jerusalem, he said.
Erekat also said municipal elections would be held in the Gaza Strip and  West Bank in mid-October, when polling is also expected to take place for a  100-seat autonomy council.
"If Israel keeps its commitments and withdraws its army from Palestinian  towns and villages ... the municipal elections will take place in  mid-October," he said.
