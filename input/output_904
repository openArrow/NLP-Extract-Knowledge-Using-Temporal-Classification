Sudan's Islamic fundamentalist military government  and mainly Christian southern rebels opened a new round of Kenyan-mediated  peace talks in Nairobi on Monday, Kenyan officials said.
Kenyan Foreign Minister Kalonzo Musyoka chaired the closed-door meeting  between officials of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and the  government, aimed at ending a conflict more than a decade old.
Khartoum's delegation, led by parliamentary speaker Mohamed al-Amin  Khalifa, was to meet members of the SPLA's two rival factions in the latest of  many negotiations organised by the six-member regional group, the  Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD).
But only a representative of the breakaway SPLA-United faction, Richard  Mulla, showed up for the closed-door talks at the Kenyan foreign ministry on  Monday morning, officials said.
It was not immediately clear who was representing the mainstream rebel  group led by SPLA founder John Garang, which took up arms to free the mainly  Christian and animist south from Islamic domination by the Arabised north 11  years ago.
Khartoum has taken advantage of a 1991 split in the rebel movement along  tribal lines to recapture a string of garrison towns it had lost to the SPLA  in the vast swamplands and savannah of the undeveloped south.
But a major government offensive launched at the end of last year seems to  have become bogged down in a virtual stalemate, though it has sent hundreds of  thousands of people fleeing towards Sudan's southern borders.
Previous peace initiatives by IGADD, which groups Kenya, Uganda, Sudan,  Eritrea, Ethiopia and Djibouti, have failed to end the war, though they have  produced agreements to allow in humanitarian aid.
