South Africa has drawn up plans to participate in  the United Nations peacekeeping mission to Rwanda, but a political decision  still has to be taken, a foreign affairs spokesman said Tuesday.
If South African troops were to go to Rwanda, it would be the first time  the newly democratic government participated in a UN operation, the previous  white-minority government having been excluded from the world body's  activities in 1974.
The UN Security Council approved Tuesday the staged deployment of 5,500  troops in the strife-torn central African country.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Roland Darroll said plans had been formulated  for South Africa to join the mission should it be requested to do so.
He told private Radio 702 that the plans had been submitted to the  country's political leadership.
"It is under very active consideration," Darroll said, adding that sending  troops to Rwanda would be an "excellent initiative" for South Africa.
President Nelson Mandela has committed South Africa to playing a role in  African affairs.
South Africa's military machine is one of the continent's largest and  boasts sophisticated equipment.
