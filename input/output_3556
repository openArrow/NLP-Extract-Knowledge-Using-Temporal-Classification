The general stock index here fell by 3.7 percent to  close at the lowest figure since November of 854.25 on Tuesday following a  decline of 2.8 percent on Monday.
The drachma, which had been under strng pressure for 10 days, was steady.
Shares in the insurance sector showed an overall decline of 7.95 percent,  in the investment sector by 4.73 percent and in the industrial sector by 4.10  percent.
"This decline is directly linked to the total liberation of capital flows  which was approved by the government 10 days ago in an attempt to halt  speculation against the drachma," a stock market adviser Leon Depolas said.
"The policy in favour of a strong drachma and high interest rates, which  were between 80 percent and 90 percent on Tuesday, are driving away foreign  investors and are putting downward pressure on prices," he said.
The index fell despite an anouncement by the government on Monday that by  the end of the year it would offer for sale 25 percent of the state OTE  telecommunications body which is the biggest state-owned company. The issue  would increase the capitalisation of the market here by nearly one third.
The drachma continued to rally against the mark and dollar on Tuesday and  was being quoted at 148.62 to the mark and 245.125 to the dollar. On Monday it  had been at 149 to the mark and late on Friday it had reached a record low  point in London of 153.35.
The Bank of Greece had not intervened on Monday and did not on Tuesday.  The chief foreign exchange dealer at Citibank in Greece, Yorgos Kondoyannis  said that on Monday the bank had earned 20 million dollars and on Tuesday  between 30 million and 40 million dollars.
Informed sources said that the government was studying the possibility of  issuing one-month treasury bonds yielding 30-35 percent.
