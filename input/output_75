Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico cleared the way  Thursday for a three-way free trade agreement after settling several  longstanding differences, officials said.
In statements issued here as well as Caracas and Mexico City, the three  governments said the Group of Three treaty would be signed at the June 15  Latin American summit in the Colombian capital and would go into effect  January 1.
"This is a historic accord, the second most important in America," said  Colombian Foreign Trade Minister Rafael Santos, saying the pact was second in  importance only to the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada, Mexico  and the United States.
Santos called the measure a definitive step toward the political  integration of Latin America.
To reach agreement, officials decided to exclude Venezuela from textile  and apparel, Santos said, adding that treatment of the petrochemical sector  was    handled on a product-by-product basis.
"We could not allow several differnces in secondary matters to sidetrack  this accord," Santos said.
