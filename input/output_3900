You may be able to blame your  irritability and general bad temper on your family, literally.
A study of twins found that genetic makeup could account for 40 percent of  indirect aggression -- throwing things or having tantrums -- while 38 percent  of general irritability may be genetically based, according to researcher Emil  Coccaro.
Direct aggression -- hitting people -- was 33 percent attributable to  genes while shouting or cursing was least affected by genetic makeup at 27  percent.
Childhood and other environmental influences accounted for the rest,  concluded Coccaro, director of the Clinical Neuroscience Research Unit at the  Medical College of Pennsylvania here.
He presented the research done with Cindy Bergeman of the University of  Notre Dame on Tuesday.
While the exact genes involved have not been identified, the problem could  be a lack of serotonin in the brain to inhibit aggressive impulses, he said.     This could lead to a medical therapy for excessive aggressiveness.
Coccaro's conclusions come from a study of 182 identical and 119 fraternal  twins. All were male and had served in the military. Nearly all were white.
