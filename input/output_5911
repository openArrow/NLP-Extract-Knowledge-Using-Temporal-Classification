South Africa must bridge the huge difference in  living standards between blacks and whites if it is to complete the successful  transition to a post-apartheid society, according to an annual UN report on  economic development published Wednesday.
The difference in development between blacks and whites in South Africa is  as great as that between Spain and the Congo, say the authors of the 1994  report sponsored by the United Nations Development Programme, warning of the  existence "not of two distinct populations but of two distint worlds."
South Africa stands 93rd in a list of 173 countries ranked according the  standard of living, or HDI -- human development indicator -- in the report.
However the whites would rank 24th, with the black population in 123rd  position if their living standards were gauged separately.
In its 1993 report, the UNDP had noted widely divergent living standards  among whites, blacks and hispanics in the United States. In South Africa, the  latest report noted, the divergence is four times as great.
"These disparities contain in themselves the seeds of serious political,  economic and social troubles," the report said. "The deserve urgent attention  from political leaders."
The greatest challenge facing South Africa's leaders, following from the  country's first all-race elections last month, will be to achieve the  integration of the less privileged sectors of society without racial violence,  the report's authors added.
