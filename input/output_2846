Democracy continues to make progress in Latin  America in spite of economic and social difficulties confronting the nations  of that region, said the International Institute of Strategic Studies in its  annual report published Monday.
Under the title "Latin America: Still Struggling", the IISS, an  independent London-based think tank dealing with international security,  conflict and arms issues, presents a cautiously optimistic picture of the  region's future.
The rise of neo-liberal political and economic policy seems to set the  pace, although troubles have beset several countries, said the group.
Brazil confronts corruption, social unrest has hit Venezuela and a  resurgence of guerilla movements has plagued Mexico, Peru, and to a lesser  extent, Central America.
"These negative developments were balanced by peaceful elections, renewed  foreign investment, increased intra-regional trade links, and the passage of  NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) in the United States, Mexico and  Canada," said the report.
In the war on drugs, Colombian forces shot and killed Pablo Escobar, head  of the Medellin cartel, in December 1993. The move allowed the government to  concentrate its efforts on the Cali cartel.
In Peru, the government of Alberto Fujimori has confronted a new series of  terrorist attacks by the Shining Path guerillas which seem to be reorganized  in spite of the 1992 capture of its leader Abimael Guzman, said the institute.
Mexico entered 1994 facing the uprising of a new group of guerillas in the  southeast of the country, the Zapatista National Liberation Army. The group  demands the redistribution of land in favor of Mayan Indians and economic  reforms.
However, the IISS said the government's will for appeasement with the  indigeonous people has had negative repercussions in the middle classes and  land owners, creating a "worryingly real" risk of the return of violence  against the Indians.
