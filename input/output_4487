The influential newspaper Asahi criticised cancellation of the Pearl  Harbor visit as a "stark contrast" to European attitudes toward post-war  visits to sensitive sites.
It cited the October 1992 visit by Britain's Queen Elizabeth to Dresden in  eastern Germany where more than 35,000 people perished in British and allied  bombing raids, and the December 1970 visit to a Jewish district in Warsaw by  then German chancellor Willy Brandt.
The newspaper noted that Japan's conservative politicians and rightists  opposed the Pearl Harbor visit because the US public might get the impression  that the emperor had gone to "apologise for Japan's wartime acts."
"Others wonder why the emperor should ever apologise since no US president  has ever uttered words of apology for the 1945 atomic bombings of Hiroshima  and Nagasaki," Asahi said.
The paper quoted a Japanese foreign ministry official as saying that the  cancellation of the Pearl Harbor visit "would not hurt Japan politically" but  pointed out how different "this way of thinking is from attitudes among  European nations."
