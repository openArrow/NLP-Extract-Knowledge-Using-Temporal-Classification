A remarkable all-round performance by Craig White earned Yorkshire a 119-  run first innings lead over Essex at Headingley.
He followed an unbeaten 108 in his side's first innings 307, by claiming a  career-best five for 40 with some hostile seam bowling as Essex were dismissed  for 188.
Yorkshire strengthened their grip by making another 43 for the loss of  Michael Vaughan, to finish the day with a lead of 162.
Adam Hollioake scored a stylish, unbeaten 66 to keep Surrey in the match  against Northamptonshire at The Oval.
Hollioake helped Surrey to 322 for eight in their second innings and a  lead of 315 amid a rash of run-outs and needless shots.
The batting was a let-down for the Surrey bowlers, notably Joey Benjamin  and acting captain Martin Bicknell, who had done much to haul them back into  the match, by bowling out Northants for 188, just seven runs more than  Surrey's first time effort.
Jon Longley and Anderson Cummins put together an unbeaten 50 stand to  restore Durham's edge, after they had slumped to 65 for six in their second  innings against Gloucestershire at Gateshead Fell.
When bad light ended play with 13 overs left, Durham were on 115 for six,  251 ahead, after dismissing Gloucestershire for 169.
Careless strokes were to blame as 14 wickets fell for 182 runs before  Longley's unbeaten 36 proved there were no great perils in the pitch.
His partnership with Cummins ruined what promised to be a sensational day  for Gloucestershire's Mike Smith, who took his side past the follow on target  with 24 not out, then enjoyed a spell of three for one in 15 balls with his  left arm seamers.
Rain washed out play in the East Midlands where Derbyshire and  Nottinghamshire face Worcestershire and Sussex respectively.
