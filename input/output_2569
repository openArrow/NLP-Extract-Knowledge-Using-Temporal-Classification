World number-one Pete Sampras, who is hoping to win  a fourth consecutive 'Grand Slam' title at the French Open Tennis  Championships, wasn't complaining when he saw the draw at the Roland Garros  stadium here on Friday.
Of the first five names French Olympic fencing champion Jean-Francois  Lamour produced from the cup -- four were qualifiers.
And the 22-year-old, 6ft 1in top-seed looks to have a relatively  straightforward passage to a scheduled semi-final showdown with either  defending champion Sergi Bruguera or the emerging Andrei Medvedev.
Although he could face Sweden's 30-year-old former finalist Mikael  Pernfors and the unpredictable Henri Leconte of France in early rounds,  Sampras' main challenge should come from either tenth-seed Boris Becker or  twice-champion Jim Courier.
Twelve months ago when he arrived in the French capital, Sampras had just  become world number-one and was top-seeded for the tournament. But he was by  no means favourite to win the event and the pundits ndded their heads wisely  when went down in straight-sets to the eventual champion.
This year, however, it is a very diferent story.
He comes to Roland Garros with an astonishing record of five consecutive  tournament wins -- including a major clay-court victory at the testing Italian  Open.
In fact he has been beaten only twice all year.
Sampras, who first hit the headlines by winning the United States Open in  1990, has shown growing maturity on the slower surfaces. And he also holds  wins this season over nearly all of his main rivals.
Stefan Edberg, Boris Becker, Michael Chang, Thomas Muster and emerging  Russian prospect Yevgeny Kafelnikov have all tumbled to the Florida-based  player whose game dramatically improved after he came under the coaching wing  of Tim Gullikson in January 1992.
And since January Sampras has rubbed salt into bleeding wounds by  defeating fellow-Americans Jim Courier, Andre Agassi and Ivan Lendl not just  once -- but TWICE.
