South African Ernie Els fought a war of  nerves as he kept his lead, half-way through the final round of the PGA  Championship here on Monday.
Three clear at the start of the final round in the 800,000 event,  24-year-old Els was caught by Jose Maria Olazabal when the Masters champion  sank an 18-foot eagle putt on the long fourth and then birdied the 191-yard  fifth.
But Els, in the match behind, grabbed a two there himself, holing from 12  feet, and when Olazabal bogeyed the seventh the gap became two.
Els stood 14 under as he started the homeward run, with Olazabal and  defending champion Bernhard Langer 12 under and Miguel Angel Jimenez 11 under.
One stroke further back came Yorkshire-based Mark James, who was five  under par for the day with two to play, Seve Ballesteros and Ryder Cup Swede  Joakim Haeggman.
