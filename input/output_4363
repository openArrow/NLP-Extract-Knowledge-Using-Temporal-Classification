President Bill Clinton is expected to announce  his decision on renewing China's most favored nation (MFN) trading status at  4:30 p.m (2030 GMT) Thursday, the White House said.
Clinton was likely to announce that he was renewing China's MFN but with  some limited sanctions because of its human rights record, informed sources  said.
The Chinese foreign ministry said at its weekly news briefing in Beijing  on Thursday that attaching conditions to MFN status would be "unwise," and it  demanded a "suitable decision" from the US president.
"The unilateral exertion of pressure and adoption of restrictive measures  with regard to trade ... is not in conformity with international practices,"  foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said.
Wu refused to comment on what steps China might take if conditions are  attached to MFN, but political analysts say a trade war is very likely if  Beijing opts to retaliate against US products and investment.
Clinton was involved in last-minute negotiations Thursday with Congressmen  on the exact details of his MFN decision and was to announce his decision  later in the day.
He announced last year that he would not renew MFN beyond June unless  China showed significant overall progress on human rights.
But as the deadline drew near, Clinton was caught between a human rights  lobby which felt China had signally failed to meet the conditions and a  powerful business lobby which argued that disrupting a 40 billion dollar trade  relationship would be an economic catastrophe.
