Italy's police chief Vincenzo Parisi has banned  demonstrations by skinheads nationwide following a weekend protest march in  the northeastern town of Vicenza, the interior ministry said Monday.
Some 300 skinheads, or right-wing extremists, marched through the streets  of Vicenza for the first time Saturday chanting racist slogans, and wearing  black shirts bearing swastikas.
The demonstration had not been banned by authorities although they kept a  close watch on the demonstrators.
The Jewish communisty in the region sent a telegram to President Oscar  Luigi Scalfaro over the weekend denouncing the march.
