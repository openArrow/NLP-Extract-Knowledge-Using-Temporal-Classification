Safety seats to protect children in automobiles  may be unsafe when used in aircraft, even though the government has approved  their use in airliners, according to a US government report.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned Friday that tests showed  forward-facing child protection seats do not offer sufficient protection for  small children.
The FAA said that airline seat belts do not adequately secure the safety  seats to the airplane's seat.
During tests conducted last year on eight child seats designed for infants  weighing between 20 and 40 pounds (nine to 18 kilos), six would have allowed  severe head injuries and the other two lesser injuries.
Child booster seats without backs were also discovered to be dangerous.
The tests showed children would hit the seats in front of them during a  crash.
The FAA added that rear-facing seats designed for infants under 20 pounds  (nine kilos) did provide protection.
Since 1985 child safety seats approved for use in automobiles have  automatically been approved for use in airliners.
The government is debating mandatory use of child seats in aircraft.  Currently adults may carry children under two years old on their laps.
