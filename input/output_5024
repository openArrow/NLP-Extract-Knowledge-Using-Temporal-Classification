Loyalist paramilitaries shot and seriously wounded  a Catholic man Saturday in Belfast, police sources said.
The outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters said they had assassinated a man,  whose identity they released, but he was later found badly wounded on  industrial wasteland.
The victim was taken to hospital, where he was said to be in a critical  condition.
