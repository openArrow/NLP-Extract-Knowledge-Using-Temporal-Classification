An outbreak of cholera has struck three provinces  in the eastern Philippines, infecting at least 320 people and killing 24 over  the past five months, the health department said here Thursday.
The disease initially struck coastal communities in Albay, Sorsogon and  Camarines Sur, but recent surveys show that it has spread inland, Grace Viola,  an official of the department's field epidemiology training program said.
She told AFP laboratory tests established the presence of the Ogawa strain  among all the cases.
The strain is the most common cholera strain in the world, she said,  adding that the health department has yet to establish the mode of  transmission. The department is supplying oral rehydration solutions to the  affected communities, she added.
Cholera was supposed to have been eradicated in the Philippines in the  early 1970s, but Viola said there have been a few outbreaks since then, the  latest of which was reported in 1992.
