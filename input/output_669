British Airways cancelled Sunday planned flights to  Paris's Orly airport, averting an international showdown over landing rights  minutes after France and Britain agreed to open the airport to flights out of  London by the end of June.
In a joint statement released here, French Transport Minister Bernard  Bosson and his British counterpart John MacGregor said they would open the  Orly-London link as soon as possible, and at the latest by the end of June.
In London a spokesman for British Airways (BA),told AFP the carrier had  decided to cancel its London-Orly services planned for Monday.
The scheduled flights would still go ahead but would be rerouted to  Paris's northern Charles de Gaulle airport, the spokesman said.
No mention was made in the joint statement to the cancellation of Monday's  flights.
On the French side, outstanding technical problems would be resolved in  the context of existing European (Union) regulations, the statement said.
In Britain problems faced by French carriers to gain landing slots at  British airports "will be examined with the same openness" and in the context  of EU rules on slot allocations, the statement added.
