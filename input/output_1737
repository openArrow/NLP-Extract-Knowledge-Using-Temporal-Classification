Three million people have been killed in  natural disasters over the past 20 years, the chief of the UN department for  humanitarian affairs said Wednesday.
The number of disaster victims is rising at a rate of six percent a year,  said Peter Hansen, the UN official, in a report to a special world conference  scheduled for May 23-27 in Yokohama, Japan on ways to reduce the risk of  natural disasters.
Participants in the conference will be informed of the results of a vast  study conducted over a thirty year period, from 1963 to 1993, that shows a  constant and rapid increase in the number of natural disasters.
"In the past two decades, earthquakes, volcanos, landslides, floods, tidal  waves, droughts and other natural events have killed some three million people  and inflicted injuries, diseases, displacement and misery on countless more  millions," said Hansen, a UN deputy secretary general.
The annual increase in the number of victims, he said, was due to  increasing population densities and a more fragile environment. He said 22  million people in Africa were threatened, mainly by drought.
