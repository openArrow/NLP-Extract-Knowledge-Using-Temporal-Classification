Masked men came under fire from a security  guard when they jumped over the garden wall of African National Congress (ANC)  secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa's Johannesburg home Thursday, police said.
The security guard became suspicious when four white men wearing masks  drove past Ramaphosa's home in a car without registration plates Thursday  morning, the domestic news agency SAPA reported.
He opened fire with a shotgun when two of the men jumped over the garden  wall. The intruders fled and it is not known whether either of them was hit.
The ANC won South Africa's first all-race election last month and are the  majority in the new government of national unity which also includes the  former ruling National Party and the Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party.
