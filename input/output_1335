Polish President Lech Walesa's popularity has  nose-dived to a record low according to an opinion poll Tuesday showing the  former Solidarity leader at a 64 percent disapproval rating against 25 percent  approval.
The figures, on a sample of 1,200 people in April by the government's CBOS  institute, show a sharp downturn from the 55 percent disapproval and 35  percent approval registered in February.
In April 1991, the Polish leader had a 70 percent approval rating.
According to an OBOP poll of 1,038 people in early May, Walesa is also  coming last behind most of his current rivals in voting intentions for the  1995 presidential elections.
In that poll, Walesa got eight percent support, former communist leader  Aleksander Kwasniewski 27, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak 19, heart-surgeon  Zbigniew Religa 17 and former premier Hanna Suchocka 10.
