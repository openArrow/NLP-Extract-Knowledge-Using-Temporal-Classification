Swedish customs on Tuesday said it was  tightening border checks because two kilos (4.4 pounds) of enriched uranium,  which have gone missing in Russia, could be smuggled to the west via Sweden or  Germany.
Peter Olsson, director of the customs intelligence service, said on  Swedish radio that it was first time there had been a risk of uranium being  smuggled out of the former Soviet Union to the west.
The missing uranium is of the type 235 capable of being used to make  nuclear weapons.
